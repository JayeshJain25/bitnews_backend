As soon as next week, the Treasury Department plans to slap sanctions on an entity in the cryptocurrency market, the two sources said on the condition of anonymity.
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control also plans to issue updated guidance to companies on how to avoid breaking US law when making ransomware payments to cybercriminals.
Spokespeople for the Treasury Department and White House's National Security Council declined to comment.
Administration officials have lamented how multimillion-dollar payments to ransomware groups based in Eastern Europe and Russia have allowed the hackers to invest in new tools for further attacks."

A large chunk of users also prefers to directly deposit their cryptocurrency on the OKEx platform to make use of the advanced trading features,” said Jay Hao, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx.com.P2P is an option that is now offered by most crypto exchanges where buyers can directly exchange fiat money against cryptocurrency from another individual.“P2P is not a way to trade crypto, but instead, it’s a fiat to crypto on-ramp solution.
In the absence of banking options during the banking ban, people would use P2P to convert their fiat to crypto (USDT) and vice-versa.
Ever since the banking ban has been struck down by the Supreme Court, most users prefer banking to P2P to deposit/withdraw INR from WazirX ,” said Nischal Shetty , CEO WazirX, another cryptocurrency exchange.Some of the exchanges claim that several other banks are continuing to offer services.A recent Reserve Bank of India missive cited that banks cannot use its 2018 circular on cryptocurrencies that prohibited any dealing in virtual currencies, as it was struck down by the apex court, ET wrote on August 31.Many of the exchanges are so buoyant that they are floating Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) products and funds where customers can invest every month to buy a handful of crypto assets.“Investors can earn interest up to 1800% in a 5-year SIP plan which is unmatched by any other asset class in the world,” said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin."
