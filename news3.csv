An announcement that Walmart would be accepting Litecoin, which turned out to be fake, created a lot of confusion, and hurt the prices of different coins. Bitcoin prices still held above $45,000 at the time of writing, and more experts are predicting a big upswing for it over the remaining months of 2021. If that happens, the rest of the market will likely be buoyed along as well, as we saw at the start of the year.

The value of Bitcoin on Monday slipped by 3.35 percent in India. The crypto currency is trading at Rs. 36,44,325. Previously, the currency had closed trading at Rs. 37,70,785 indicating that in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has shrunken substantially with a fresh value difference of over Rs. 1 lakh, as per the Gadgets 360 Bitcoin Price History tracker.

Ethereum, that is currently valued at Rs. 2,56,011, has also witnessed a slip of 4.82 percent. The crypto currency had closed at Rs 2,68,975 – and has gone down in value by over Rs. 12,000.

And Dogecoin, that was riding on the value of Rs. 20 last week, has again slipped down significantly by 5.76 percent. The Elon Musk-supported crypto currency is priced at Rs 17.86 in India as we write this.

On the other hand, crypto currencies like Tether and USD Coin have gained value by 1 percent each and are trading at Rs. 79.89 each as well.

Cryptocurrency trading and transactions are picking momentum around the world, despite anti-crypto voices questioning the legibility of these digital currencies. Last week, the President of the European Central bank, Christine Lagarde had said that she does not consider cryptocurrencies as real.

Statistics platform CompareCamp on the other hand has recently reported that there are over 350,000 Bitcoin transactions daily, with an average of 14,904 every hour, or four transactions per second.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_colours_reuters_1611921415626.jpg',)",2 min read,"Crypto prices have slipped a little over the weekend, with Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Ether all down.

ETH price must stay above $3,150 to avoid more losses in the near term.

Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $3,500 and $3,550 resistance levels.

The price is now trading below $3,300 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

The pair could a steady increase as long as it is above the $3,150 support zone.

Ethereum Price is Eyeing Decent Recovery

Ethereum failed to clear the main $3,500 resistance zone. ETH started a major decline below the $3,400 support zone and the 100 hourly simple moving average, similar to bitcoin.

The price traded below the $3,320 and $3,250 support levels. Finally, ether spiked below $3,200, but the bulls were active near the key $3,150 support zone. A low is formed near $3,156 and the price is now consolidating losses.

An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $3,230 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $3,456 high to $3,156 low. The first major resistance is now forming near the $3,320 level (the last key support).

The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $3,456 high to $3,156 low is also near $3,320. Besides, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,360 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. A clear break and close above the $3,400 level could start another increase. The next major resistance sits near $3,500.

More Losses in ETH?

If ethereum fails to correct higher above the $3,250 and $3,320 resistance levels, it could start another decline. An initial support on the downside is near the $3,180 level.

The next major support seems to be forming near the $3,150 level. A downside break below the $3,150 support zone could spark a sharp decline. The next major support is near the $3,000 level, below which ether price might decline towards the $2,880 support zone in the near term.

Technical Indicators

Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is slowly losing pace in the bearish zone.

2021-09-20 12:00:24,NDTV.com,Are Institutional Investors Warming Up To The Idea Of Cryptocurrency?,https://www.ndtv.com/business/how-the-growth-of-cryptocurrency-is-changing-perception-of-institutional-investors-2544264,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has put his company at the centre of decentralised finance

The rapid rise of cryptocurrency has not just attracted retail investors but also the big guys of the finance world who are eyeing a part of the booming sector. Following Bitcoin's launch in January 2009, the initial years of the crypto industry were driven largely by technology enthusiasts and amateur investors. Institutional investors had dismissed Bitcoin as a worthless digital asset favoured mostly by criminals, hackers, and profiteers. But now that the market capitalisation of the crypto industry has surpassed $2 trillion, institutions are finding it difficult to let go of the business opportunity.

The shift in approach has been driven by a number of factors, including the incredible success of Bitcoin and other crypto coins. Some institutions are diverting their money to cryptocurrency as a strategy to diversify their investment, with billions of dollars worth of institutional capital flowing into the space this year alone.

Take for example MicroStrategy and its founder Michael Saylor, an outspoken supporter of Bitcoin. The IT services firm is already the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world, even ahead of Elon Musk's Tesla. It recently bought another 5,050 Bitcoin to solidify its lead to $5.1 billion.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, another Bitcoin maximalist who founded a mobile payments company named Square, has put his company at the centre of decentralised finance (defi). Square is among the top 5 investors in Bitcoin.

The term unicorn, reserved for private startup companies reaching a value of $1 billion, has found a new meaning with the growth of cryptocurrency. CoinDCX, an online exchange that facilitates trading in Bitcoin and other crypto coins founded in 2018, recently became India's first crypto unicorn after a round of financing.

But there are some also who have not found the crypto industry very encouraging. Like Lee Cooperman. The US billionaire investor and hedge fund manager recently said he still does not understand Bitcoin. He said he thinks it's not in the interest of the US government to further a substitute for the dollar.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/elk956bg_crypto_625x300_09_August_21.jpg',)",2 min read,"Following Bitcoin's launch in January 2009, the initial years of the crypto industry were driven largely by technology enthusiasts and amateur investors.

The pseudonymous trader, known in the industry as Smart Contracter, tells his 165,600 followers that he sees Bitcoin (BTC) dropping below $40,000 while Ethereum (ETH) could slide below $3,000.

“Took profit on a whole lot of my alt positions despite how bullish I think they may look. I think BTC and ETH are both about to put in deeper C waves, correcting the 5 wave rises they both had from the July lows and a push down to $36,000 and $2,600 respectively will affect everything.”

Smart Contracter relies on the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that forecasts future price action by following the psychology of market participants that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, an asset goes through a significant leg down (ABC wave) after completing a five-wave cycle in an uptrend.

Recently, Smart Contracter said that he’s looking at Solana (SOL) and Ethereum competitor Avalanche (AVAX) for possible rallies. The other coins on his radar are Synthetix (SNX), a cryptocurrency that powers the trading of synthetic assets, and Curve (CRV), the governance token of stablecoin decentralized exchange Curve Finance.

While Smart Contracter is short-term bearish on Bitcoin, fellow crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes BTC is on the verge of igniting a rally to $50,000 after holding the key support level above $47,000.

“Still pretty much fine for Bitcoin.”

At time of writing, BTC is trading at $47,941, according to CoinMarketCap.

2021-09-20 12:00:24,NDTV.com,Are Institutional Investors Warming Up To The Idea Of Cryptocurrency?,https://www.ndtv.com/business/how-the-growth-of-cryptocurrency-is-changing-perception-of-institutional-investors-2544264,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has put his company at the centre of decentralised finance

The rapid rise of cryptocurrency has not just attracted retail investors but also the big guys of the finance world who are eyeing a part of the booming sector. Following Bitcoin's launch in January 2009, the initial years of the crypto industry were driven largely by technology enthusiasts and amateur investors. Institutional investors had dismissed Bitcoin as a worthless digital asset favoured mostly by criminals, hackers, and profiteers. But now that the market capitalisation of the crypto industry has surpassed $2 trillion, institutions are finding it difficult to let go of the business opportunity.

The shift in approach has been driven by a number of factors, including the incredible success of Bitcoin and other crypto coins. Some institutions are diverting their money to cryptocurrency as a strategy to diversify their investment, with billions of dollars worth of institutional capital flowing into the space this year alone.

Take for example MicroStrategy and its founder Michael Saylor, an outspoken supporter of Bitcoin. The IT services firm is already the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world, even ahead of Elon Musk's Tesla. It recently bought another 5,050 Bitcoin to solidify its lead to $5.1 billion.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, another Bitcoin maximalist who founded a mobile payments company named Square, has put his company at the centre of decentralised finance (defi). Square is among the top 5 investors in Bitcoin.

The term unicorn, reserved for private startup companies reaching a value of $1 billion, has found a new meaning with the growth of cryptocurrency. CoinDCX, an online exchange that facilitates trading in Bitcoin and other crypto coins founded in 2018, recently became India's first crypto unicorn after a round of financing.

But there are some also who have not found the crypto industry very encouraging. Like Lee Cooperman. The US billionaire investor and hedge fund manager recently said he still does not understand Bitcoin. He said he thinks it's not in the interest of the US government to further a substitute for the dollar.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/elk956bg_crypto_625x300_09_August_21.jpg',)",2 min read,"Following Bitcoin's launch in January 2009, the initial years of the crypto industry were driven largely by technology enthusiasts and amateur investors.

The pseudonymous trader, known in the industry as Smart Contracter, tells his 165,600 followers that he sees Bitcoin (BTC) dropping below $40,000 while Ethereum (ETH) could slide below $3,000.

“Took profit on a whole lot of my alt positions despite how bullish I think they may look. I think BTC and ETH are both about to put in deeper C waves, correcting the 5 wave rises they both had from the July lows and a push down to $36,000 and $2,600 respectively will affect everything.”

Smart Contracter relies on the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that forecasts future price action by following the psychology of market participants that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, an asset goes through a significant leg down (ABC wave) after completing a five-wave cycle in an uptrend.

Recently, Smart Contracter said that he’s looking at Solana (SOL) and Ethereum competitor Avalanche (AVAX) for possible rallies. The other coins on his radar are Synthetix (SNX), a cryptocurrency that powers the trading of synthetic assets, and Curve (CRV), the governance token of stablecoin decentralized exchange Curve Finance.

While Smart Contracter is short-term bearish on Bitcoin, fellow crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes BTC is on the verge of igniting a rally to $50,000 after holding the key support level above $47,000.

“Still pretty much fine for Bitcoin.”

At time of writing, BTC is trading at $47,941, according to CoinMarketCap.

He stated that SkyBridge holds crypto worth $700 million presently.

The alternative investment firm has filed for a cryptocurrency company ETF which simply means a crypto-based exchange-traded fund.

They did this on Tuesday, aiming to increase their digital currency offerings. SkyBridge Capital also revealed its plans for the Algorand fund during the SALT conference held within the week in New York.

SkyBridge Crypto Assets Worth

SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci while addressing CNBC, stated that the firm raised over $100 million for the new Algorand fund. Anthony was also the former Director of White House Communications. It was Scaramucci who valued the company’s crypto-assets to be about $700 million.

The CEO reaffirmed that crypto has come to stay. However, he added that if regulations plan to fan the increasing adoption of digital asset technology, they should take quick action.

Anthony explained the crypto adoption as similar to Uber, which the regulators planned to knock out of the system. But the people later won because they accepted its use. He predicts that the United States will start recording up to 200 million crypto users in no distant time.

The SkyBridge CEO made these comments when spectators were concerned about having a regulatory crackdown maned by SEC.

Gary Gensler, the head of SEC, had characterized the crypto sector as rife associated with abuse and fraud. But Anthony Scaramucci, despite his disagreement, appreciated Gary for his stake in crypto.

He explained that Gary had many people that are yet to understand crypto in Congress fully. As a result, they have a lot of negativity, and he will call on elites like Elizabeth Warren to attend such a conference.

However, sitting with members of the industry will make her understand the protocols better. Anthony suggests that the need to carry everyone alone by educating them.

Other Finance Magnates Opinion

Other finance lords in their speech didn’t share Anthony’s optimism. Instead, they doubted the possibility of crypto adoption outrunning the grip of strong-handed regulations.

However, while speaking to CNBC, he said that even if the crypto adoption successfully increases, the lawmakers will kill it. He believed that lawmakers would succeed in killing it as they have their ways of doing so.

Dalio explained that every monetary asset that offers a cash alternative is worth considering, including Bitcoin.

The founder of two cryptocurrency hedge funds in New York, Stefan Qin, has been sentenced to 7.5 years in prison and three years of supervised release. He is also ordered to forfeit about $55 million. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said that he “engaged in a scheme to steal assets” from his hedge funds and defraud investors.

Crypto Hedge Fund Founder Gets 7.5 Years in Jail

Stefan Qin, the founder of two cryptocurrency hedge funds in New York, has been sentenced to 7.5 years in prison, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced last week.

Qin, a 24-year-old Australian national, founded the Virgil Sigma Fund and the VQR Multistrategy Fund, which claimed to have over $100 million dollars in investments. He pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud on Feb. 4 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against him in December last year.

According to the DOJ, Qin was sentenced Wednesday to 90 months in prison.

The Department of Justice explained that between 2017 and 2020, Qin owned and controlled the two cryptocurrency investment funds. “Until recently, Virgil Sigma purported to have over $90 million under management from dozens of investors, including many in the United States,” the Department said. “Until recently, VQR had at least approximately $24 million under management from investors.”

The DOJ detailed:

Since 2017, Qin engaged in a scheme to steal assets from Virgil Sigma and defraud its investors. Rather than investing the fund’s assets in a cryptocurrency arbitrage trading strategy as advertised, Qin embezzled investor capital from Virgil Sigma and used the funds for purposes other than the purported arbitrage trading strategy.

Qin also attempted to steal assets from VQR as Bitcoin.com News previously reported. The DOJ explained that Qin’s two cryptocurrency funds “have ceased operations and the liquidation and distribution of assets is being handled by a court-appointed receiver in the matter of S.E.C. v. Qin, 20 Civ. 10849,” adding:

Qin, 24, was also sentenced to three years of supervised release, and ordered to forfeit $54,793,532.

2021-09-19 12:00:24,Mint,The case for cryptocurrency to be outlawed until we regulate it,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-case-for-cryptocurrency-to-be-outlawed-until-we-regulate-it-11632068665038.html,"Gold has no intrinsic value, but its scarcity and acceptability have created a pricing mechanism for it. Theoretically, any stone of any colour found only in select regions that can be used as an ornament will gather value from scarcity and acceptability. The same is true of cryptocurrency. There are willing buyers and sellers of something that has come from out of the blue. The idea has gained strength with the government of El Salvador announcing that it holds Bitcoin. The corollary is that if a government believes in it, no one can be left out and its use may become a habit.

Bitcoin, created by Satoshi Nakamoto, who has not yet been identified, is the most popular cryptocurrency. Despite its cryptic origin, Bitcoin is widely traded and a force to reckon with in financial markets. Other currencies have emerged with fancy names such as Ethereum, Litecoin and Dogecoin. While we may have to accept this wave, the broader question is whether they should be allowed to circulate.

The main purpose of a currency is to serve as a medium of exchange for transactions. Logically, the reins of such an instrument must be with a country’s central bank as we cannot have multiple currencies operating within a jurisdiction. In India, we must surrender foreign exchange beyond a limit to the Reserve Bank of India and cannot buy goods and services domestically with dollars or euros. This is the edifice of a currency system, which provides the basis for monetary policy. But today, interestingly, one can pay for hotels in Thailand or insurance in Switzerland with Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is being used as a medium of exchange. This is bad news for central banks. If everyone uses cryptos for transactions, monetary policy would become superfluous.

The genesis of such currencies lay in the perception that central banks and governments had mismanaged economies by printing too much currency, which was what the US Federal Reserve did through quantitative easing, later followed by other central banks. The roll-back of all this easy money is now a problem, as it can generate turbulence in financial markets.

The concept of cryptocurrency seeks to overcome such a problem by generating a finite—yet infinite—stream of coins through blockchain technology. It’s finite because there is typically a cap on final currency units, but it’s infinite as the new coins generated would be at a proportion of the remaining balance, and this never changes. But their anonymity of use creates a conundrum, as the antecedents of a payment-maker can’t be known. Because identity gets concealed, such currencies serve as useful conduits for drug money. Therefore, it would be injudicious for governments to legitimize cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange.

An interesting implication of this was that there was nothing sacrosanct about Bitcoin, and so came a plethora of other cryptocurrencies. There are around 6,000 of them presently, although probably not more than 10 are actively being followed and traded.

How about crypto as an investment? If one can invest in stocks, race-horses and gaming, then why not in such currencies? Many things hold value that aren’t backed by anything but market perception. This is not too different from betting on sports or elections, in which there are no fundamentals driving the price. The argument here can be that if we permit these currencies as investment avenues, then all activities of this nature should be made legitimate (and taxed). Even betting on Indian Premier League matches can be seen as an investment. What’s important is that tax authorities should be aware of such transactions, lest they become ‘hawala’ deals where the gains escape taxation. There is already a lot of scepticism over participatory notes floated by foreign portfolio investors on concerns that Indians could be rerouting foreign exchange through them.

There is a strong case for banning cryptocurrencies, though tracking their activity could be a challenge. Or, if we allow them as investment avenues, investors should make full disclosures so that all transactions are taxed—under GST as well as capital gains.

There are two major threats for governments and central banks. First, while such transactions operate outside the financial system, all these currencies are denoted in dollars. This means that investors are using formal channels to gather dollars to pay for these cryptocurrencies. Therefore, any shock in the Bitcoin market can seriously disrupt the formal financial system.

The second is even more serious. If cryptos are legitimized, there is nothing to stop entities from starting a parallel crypto-banking system, where they accept deposits from holders and pay an interest rate which is higher than what one gets from a bank and use the same as a peer-to-peer lending platform. This can go on without authorities noticing.

The government of India has been relentlessly going after black money with measures like demonetization, which proved unsuccessful despite its boldness. Allowing cryptos would only encourage black money to be generated and stashed away from the regulatory system’s reach. Good reasons exist to ban them until we can put in place an appropriate regulatory framework.

The intraday trading volume of the token has fallen by 20.33% over the last 24 hours. It indicates that investors might be losing interest in the coin and could lead to a downfall.

Will CHZ Token Price Fall Below The $0.30 Mark?

CHZ token price action represents a support zone near the $0.30 mark. The possibility of the bearish downfall of this zone increases as the underlying bearishness increases.

The breakout of this zone may interest investors in taking a short position for Chiliz cryptocurrency; As the EMAs fall in a bearish alignment, the token price fails to rise above the 20-period EMA. Thus, the crossover of 100 and 200-period EMA seems imminent.

The RSI (Bearish) indicates bullish momentum as the RSI line moves lower towards the oversold territory.

The ADX shows a slight rise in trend momentum as the bearish trend starts.

Conclusion – The CHZ token price may soon initiate a downfall if it breaks below the zone of the $0.30 mark. Investors may find this breakout as a bearish entry spot. However, a bullish stage is provided by the zone that may result in a price jump. Hence, investors must be careful, observant and patient to wait for the breakout.

Bitcoin is the most popular and preferred cryptocurrency in the world. Its value is rising as more investors become interested in this ""digital gold."" Bitcoin has the longest history of any cryptocurrency. With a far larger price, market valuation, and volume than any other investment option, it's clear to see why it's the top. Despite the thousands of different cryptocurrencies on the market, Bitcoin still accounts for more than 40% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.

Bitcoin will continue to dominate the cryptocurrency industry regardless of whether its price rises or falls. Traders will gain from strong liquidity as long as it exists, regardless of market volatility.

Ethereum

In comparison to Bitcoin, Ethereum is more than just a digital currency. It's also a network that allows developers to use the Ethereum network to create their own cryptocurrency. While Ethereum is far behind Bitcoin in terms of value, it is also considerably ahead of its rivals.

The price of ETH grew in 2021, much like the price of Bitcoin (BTC), but for different reasons: For example, Ethereum made headlines when a piece of digital art was sold for more than 38,000 ETH - or 69.3 million USD - as the world's most expensive NFT.

Binance Coin (BNB)

One of the few cryptocurrencies to have surpassed its 2017 high is Binance Coin. There was a bull market throughout that year, and the prices of all cryptocurrencies soared along with it, reaching a peak before plateauing and declining in value.

As an incentive, Binance Coin users enjoy a reduction on transaction costs on the Binance Exchange. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and others, can be exchanged or traded for BNB.

Binance Coin began as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain before becoming the native currency of Binance's own blockchain, the Binance Chain, in July 2017.

Binance Coin has maintained a modest but steady upward trend since 2017. Binance Coin has been shown to be one of the more dependable investment options with lower risks due to its performance.

Cardano (ADA)

Cardano's currency, ADA, briefly broke the $3 level before falling to $2.34 as of this writing. While others may argue that BTC and other major crypto players artificially boosted the Cardano price, the truth is that this has been in the works for quite some time.

Cardano has climbed 1600% year-to-date. As a result, the ADA will be one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in 2021.

Uniswap (UNI)

Since the turn of the year, the UNI price action has been quite positive. UNI has outperformed numerous other DeFi currencies from the beginning of 2021. The token has gained approximately 800 percent since January 1, 2021, when it hit an all-time high of $44.97 on 3 May.

Despite the fact that the token just experienced a steep drop in value, investors are still flocking to the UNI market due to the project's excellent fundamentals. According to technical analysis, UNI has recovered in recent weeks and has overcome some big obstacles to retake the $33 support.

Uniswap allows users to trade cryptocurrency without having to sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange account. Instead, connect your Ethereum wallet to Uniswap's website and start trading crypto straight from your Ethereum wallet.

How to Store Your Crypto Safely?

If you want to invest in cryptocurrencies for the long run, stay away from trading platforms because they can be hacked at any time. Buying a hardware wallet is the safest way to keep your digital valuables safe. Hardware wallets are offline wallets that store your coins in cold storage, making them impossible to steal.

Yes, historically speaking. Prices have multiplied hundreds, if not thousands, of times in the last ten years. For example, Bitcoin, which was once valued less than a dollar, has now risen to nearly $35,000.

But its founders have a history of feuds and are now competing for crypto dominance.,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ethereum-eth-cofounders-vitalik-buterin-cardano-charles-hoskinson-gavin-wood-2021-9,"Vitalik Buterin dreamed up ethereum in 2013.

Vitalik Buterin

Vitalik Buterin has compared the eight founders of the ethereum blockchain to JRR Tolkien's close-knit ""fellowship of the ring"", according to the Financial Times.

Yet, the story of the group is one marked by feuds and competition, with two members splintering off to create ethereum rivals cardano and polkadot. Buterin recently said choosing seven other founders ""nondiscriminately"" to build the network was his biggest regret.

The 27-year-old is one of the most famous figures in crypto, having come up with the idea for ethereum - a cryptocurrency network on which decentralized applications can be built - in 2013. He was just 19 at the time and 21 when ethereum launched in 2015.

Before that, Buterin had become a fan of bitcoin and crypto technology after being introduced to it by his dad, and went on to cofound Bitcoin Magazine. Buterin still works on the network, driving research and providing new ideas.

Ethereum cofounder and Cardano creator, Charles Hoskinson Charles Hoskinson/YouTube

Charles Hoskinson

Maths whizz Charles Hoskinson quickly became an influential member of the ethereum startup that emerged in 2013. Yet, his time on the project came to an end within months, in part because of his prickly relationship with other founders. Hoskinson wanted ethereum to be a for-profit company, but Buterin wanted it to be a nonprofit platform.

Accounts vary about what happened: Hoskinson says he left, others say Butern fired him. Either way, the two are known to not particularly like each other and occasionally still take digs at the other's methods.

After leaving ethereum, Hoskinson founded the cardano blockchain platform whose ada cryptocurrency has recently soared to become the third-biggest. Cardano is known as an ""ETH killer"" as it also lets users build their own projects and is a competitor with ethereum.

Gavin Wood went on to found polkadot. Parity

Gavin Wood

English computer scientist Gavin Wood became an important ethereum coder after joining the group in 2014. In fact, he created the first ethereum test network and made a number of other key programming contributions.

Wood left ethereum in 2016, and went on to found polkadot, another ETH killer crypto network focused on trying to link together different blockchains. Polkadot's dot cryptocurrency has risen more than 500% in the last year as excitement has built around the project.

The polkadot founder has been known to take swipes at ethereum. For example, in 2020 he contrasted its ""slow"" transaction times with polkadot's quicker speeds.

Joe Lubin went on to found ConsenSys. Riccardo Savi/Getty Images

Joe Lubin

Although many of the ethereum cofounders were in their 20s, Lubin was older and more experienced when he came on board in 2013. The Princeton-educated computer scientist worked for Goldman Sachs before becoming disillusioned with traditional finance during the financial crisis.

Lubin founded the for-profit ethereum development company ConsenSys, which has launched a number of different projects on the network. One example is the widely used ""wallet"" MetaMask. ConsenSys raised $65 million from JPMorgan, UBS and others this year.

Anthony Di Iorio recently said he's quitting the crypto world. Ethan Lou/Reuters

Anthony Di Iorio

Anthony Di Iorio was an entrepreneur and bitcoin enthusiast before Buterin asked him to come on board to launch ethereum. Yet, he was reportedly also not so keen on ethereum non-profit direction and took a backseat. He went on to found Decentral, which launched the Jaxx crypto wallet.

Di Iorio hit the headlines earlier this year when he said he was quitting the crypto world and selling his company, partly because of concerns about his personal safety. He said another key reason was to focus on philanthropy.

Mihai Alisie is now working on a crypto project called Akasha. @MihaiAlisie/Twitter

Mihai Alisie

Mihai Alisie has known Buterin since 2011 when they founded Bitcoin Magazine, one of the first publications solely dedicated to crypto. Alisie was important in setting up the Swiss company that gave ethereum a legal and financial base in its early days.

He was vice president of the Ethereum Foundation - the non-profit organization which supports the network - until 2015. He stepped back to found Akasha, a crypto project looking to harness the technology for social purposes.

Jeffrey Wilcke is now a video-game designer. @etehreum/Twitter

Jeffrey Wilcke

Computer programmer Jeffrey Wilke was a key player in the early days of ethereum, writing a version of the platform in the Google Go language. That turned into Go Ethereum, or Geth.

He has since left to form a games company called Grid Games with his brother. Wilcke has said he felt his energy was better spent elsewhere, ""away from the drama"" of ethereum.

Amir Chetrit

Amir Chetrit is the most mysterious and publicity shy of the group, but was working on a crypto startup called Colored Coins - which Buterin also worked on - when he joined ethereum.

Yet, according to journalist Matthew Leising, who wrote a book about ethereum called ""Out of the Ether,"" other members thought Chetrit wasn't pulling his weight. Leising wrote that this led to Buterin kicking him out of the project with Hoskinson.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/614490f22257350018f7512c?format=jpeg',)",4 min read,"Hoskinson wanted ethereum to be a for-profit company, but Buterin wanted it to be a nonprofit platform.

The phenomenal rise of cryptocurrency has opened up an era of possibilities. And NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are riding on the crest of this new technology. From art to music and pixelated images to toilet paper, these digital assets are selling like the proverbial hotcakes, some of them for millions of dollars. The basis for this craze for NFTs is their uniqueness – that is they cannot be replaced like-for-like. For example, Bitcoin is not an NFT. But a one-of-a-kind piece of art is non-fungible. You cannot replace it. If you trade it with another piece of art you will have something completely different.

What Is NFT?

The word “non-fungible” means one of a kind. NFTs are digital assets that represent real-world objects like music, art, digital avatars or images, videos, or any other collectible items but cannot be duplicated. They are backed by blockchain technology. The NFTs are sold online, frequently for crypto coins, and are encoded. They have been around since 2014 but have gained popularity only now. Recently, a set of 101 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT was sold for $24.4 million (roughly Rs. 179 crore) at Sotheby's auction house.

If all that an NFT signifies is a digital asset, meaning intangible, why are people spending millions on it? They spend so much because an NFT allows the buyer to own the original item. Also, it contains a built-in authentication, which is the proof of ownership for the buyer. Most collectors value these “digital rights” more than the item itself.

NFT vs Cryptocurrency

While an NFT is built with the same technology as cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, the similarity ends there. Cryptocurrencies can be traded for one another and are equal in value, that is one rupee will always be worth another rupee and one Bitcoin will always be worth another Bitcoin, irrespective of their price fluctuations with respect to other similar currencies.

NFTs are different. Each NFT (virtual asset) has a digital signature, via encoding, which makes it impossible to be exactly replicated.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/jnqec5do_cryptocurrency_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",2 min read,"Non-fungible tokens are the new rage in the crypto worldThe phenomenal rise of cryptocurrency has opened up an era of possibilities.

How Does It Help Law Enforcement Agencies?

Blockchain is a digital and decentralized public ledger with a system that records transactions across several computers linked to a peer-to-peer network. It was originally developed for cryptocurrency assets like Bitcoin in 2008. Blockchain Analysis/ Crypto Forensics creates transparency for a global economy built on blockchains, enabling banks, businesses, and governments to have a common understanding of how people and businesses use cryptocurrency.

Following is a brief on how LEA's can leverage Crypto Forensics to build a charge sheet for successful case closure.

> Visualization and Tracking Tools: Case management solution maintains user-friendly case tracking that has been developed for secure, practical and collaborative use

> Broad Transaction Coverage: Ensures real-time information across all the major blockchains and thousands of entities, currently attributing 90% of all active transactions

> Automated & Evidence-Based: Provides immutable historical data logging with real-time updates and sophisticated risk assessment. Available through API license

Law Enforcement/compliance officers can track and trace potentially illicit activities such as fraud, scams, security breaches, money laundering, or terrorist financing by using crypto forensics tools.

Views and thought on the cryptocurrency concerning retail investors.

In India, there are close to 15 million retail investors, who are registered with various Indian cryptocurrency exchanges. Education is a must for retail investors before investing in cryptocurrency. Most of the cryptocurrency sees 15-20% price volatility in a week or so and it creates anxiety in retail investors. Additionally, the government of India hasn't defined cryptocurrency as a legal entity. However, due to the fundamental nature of peer-to-peer transactions mechanisms of cryptocurrencies, investors can trade in cryptocurrency without any third party knowing about it. How to keep oneself safe from these frauds Retail investors should lookout for the following indicators before buying into any scheme or investment advice:

> Is the company registered in India, if not, avoid any financial transaction or bitcoin transaction

> Who are the owners – You will get the background of all the owners from the internet and if the company hasn't declared their names on their website, stay away from them. Investors should invest 1-2 hours in basic research before putting their hard-earned money

> What is the cryptocurrency they are selling and from which online platform? There are more than 1500 cryptocurrencies across the globe and all of them do not have the technology or use case to further their business needs. Investors should target only the top 10-15 cryptocurrencies for trading.

> Buy cryptocurrency in India from crypto exchanges that have a valid and transparent KYC (Know Your Customer) system in place. There are around 15 crypto exchanges that will qualify

> Do not trust any here say, be prepare to do some research on any new technology and accordingly take actions

> Indian crypto exchanges with valid KYC practice provides investors safety, in case the crypto exchanges are hacked. Do not buy any cryptocurrency from any exchanges that do not protect your digital assets.

> Lastly, there is an umpteen number of wallets available on the market, propagated by the private players. Investors should use at least 3-levels of password protection mechanisms (password, 2FA and google authentication) and do not share passwords on the mail or SMS/ WhatsApp with their loved ones.

Are there any grievance redressal process for fraud victims and what they should do if they fall victim?

Since cryptocurrency has not been legally defined by the Government of India, there is no government redressal system available in India. However, independent bodies likes Hyderabad Security Cluster and BEGIN India Think Tank continue to help investors if they get cheated, on case to case basis. Large fraud has been reported to the police and filed as FIR. However, due to the lack of capacity and capability of Indian LEAs & forensics agencies, digital forensics evidence does not get recorded and most of the culprits got bail in the respective cases.

Chinese Online Gambling Scam Case Study

High Possibility of Cryptocurrency paid as Gambling money By Indian Nationals to Chinese apps

August 2020

A Chinese national and three of his Indian associates have been arrested in a crackdown on an illegal online gambling racket being run by a China-based company, the police said on Thursday. The Chinese national and his associates were arrested by the Hyderabad police from Delhi on Wednesday and brought to Hyderabad on Thursday.

The development comes a day after Chinese individuals and companies were raided by income tax sleuths in Delhi, Gurugram and Noida on suspicion of laundering money.

The online gambling was allegedly organised by different companies under the umbrella of China-based “Beijing T Power Company”, the police claimed, adding that transactions worth Rs 1,100 crore had been unearthed.

A total of 1.24 crore transactions were found to be paid to Chinese online betting scams websites for a total of INR 11,00 crore by Indian Nationals.

The HSBC bank accounts in operation were located in Gurugram One Chinese national, Yah Hao, the online firm’s head of operations and three Indian nationals, namely - Dheeraj Sarkar, Ankit Kapoor and Neeraj Tuli were arrested from their office in Gurugram.

Involvement of Cryptocurrency

> On average money paid by Indian nationals through banks to Chinese Online Gambling is pretty small and would range in INR 150-500 per individual.

> We suspect the possible Involvement of Cryptocurrency paid to Chinese Online Gambling Company, by Indian nationals, which is not uncovered in various raids conducted by ED.

> A large amount of online gambling money is easier to transfer through cryptocurrency as cryptocurrency transactions don’t require any third-party banks to complete the transfer of the funds.

How Hyderabad Security Cluster & HumanSTAR Can Help.

In association and guidance from Hyderabad Security Cluster, HumanSTAR can provide exact details of cryptocurrency funds movement from one wallet address to another wallet address.

HSC & HS can provide a detailed data analysis of funds that are transferred to the Online Gambling Chinese app with country and crypto exchange details.

For this to happen, HSC & HS will require a Bitcoin wallet address, transaction id and other cryptocurrency details from police.

The employees of Beijing T Power Company arrested will have all these details in their official communication with the customers or within the office memo.

> It may take 20-30 days for HSC & HS to provide evidence of cryptocurrency involvement and detailed data analysis, once respective details are shared by police.

On September 17, 2021, Solana protocol fans were introduced to the launch of the Wormhole Network’s ethereum – solana bridge, which means assets between each chain can be intermingled. The launch announcement notes that Saber, the Solana-fueled protocol with more than $4 billion total-value locked (TVL), will support migration from Wormhole V1 to V2.

Wormhole Launches Ethereum – Solana Bridge

Solana has risen 5,504% in value during the last year and today, solana (SOL) is a top ten crypto-asset holding the seventh largest position in terms of market capitalization. At the time of writing, the overall solana (SOL) market valuation is $48.4 billion and there’s a circulating supply of 296,830,872 SOL, according to Coingecko data. On Friday, the Wormhole Network announced the launch of the Wormhole Token Bridge.

“Today we’re incredibly excited to announce the launch of our Wormhole Token Bridge starting with Ethereum and Solana,” the Wormhole Network’s Twitter account said. “First up – migration of assets from the soon to be unsupported Wormhole V1 to Wormhole V2 will be available. V1 users will be able to simply exchange their assets for V2 assets at a 1-to-1 rate on wormholebridge.com.”

“The liquidity for this swap will be replenished periodically, please bear with us. There are about $250M worth of assets in Wormhole V1 to be migrated,” the Twitter thread added.

In a recent report, Bitcoin.com News detailed how the growth of blockchain bridges and cross-chain capabilities have expanded a great deal. In a panel hosted by Sanctor Capital, the founder of the Yearn Finance project, Andre Cronje, emphasized the importance of cross-chain compatibility.

“The whole defi wave gave a reason for people to begin interacting with different blockchains. And the more we’re interacting, the more we are realizing that there’s actually a little bit too much activity for any one chain to handle this stuff,” Cronje said. The Yearn Finance founder added:

While I can’t specifically pinpoint a big bang moment, it’s a combination of the maturing of different blockchains and their defi ecosystems, and things like NFTs that are giving people more and more of a reason to interact.

Solana IDOs Explode With Demand, Saber TVL Surpasses $4 Billion

It is the best advice any friend ever offered to me,” says the 28-year-old resident of Ahmedabad.About 1,200 km away, Yashika has started designing non-fungible tokens or NFTs in Chandigarh, after she managed big returns from crypto trading. “I started investing in cryptocurrencies soon after I learnt about NFTs,” says the 25-year-old, who uses only one name. “I started my journey as an NFT artist and along the way, I started learning and researching more and more about cryptocurrencies and what could make a good investment.”Yashika has invested in binance, ethereum, bitcoin and doge, and has been actively trading in crypto assets since March this year.Vyas and Yashika are the faces behind the Indian cryptocurrency boom. They are educated, they are sharp and they don’t live in big cities.Youngsters and investors from tier-2 and tier-3 cities have flocked to cryptocurrency platforms in the last few months of the pandemic.Crypto exchanges are now recording more growth from smaller cities than metros, as per data from top exchanges.Riding on the trend, cryptocurrency exchanges have also actively targeted a new breed of professionals residing in smaller cities with new schemes and fresh products.The exchanges say the average age of investors has dropped while their investments have gone up.Leading crypto exchange WazirX said the majority of its users are below 35 years of age and that it has recorded 2,648 per cent growth in user signups in 2021 from tier-2 and tier-3 cities of India.“In fact, tier-2 and tier-3 cities have driven almost 55 per cent of total user sign-ups on WazirX in 2021, thereby overtaking tier-1 cities, which demonstrated a sign-up growth of 2,375 per cent,” said Nischal Shetty, CEO at WazirX.Other exchanges too have recorded similar trends with most of the new cryptocurrency investors coming from cities such as Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Patna, Bhopal, Vadodara and Kolkata.As per data available with BuyUcoin, a cryptocurrency exchange, Bhopal saw the highest jump — by 100 per cent — in new investors this year.Data from top exchanges show that more than 90 per cent of the new investors are IT professionals, MBA graduates, engineers and startup owners.Industry trackers say the new age investors are not only changing the way they invest but also how they invest and in which assets they invest.These investors are not just sticking to bitcoins but are also buying and trading other cryptocurrencies, which seems to be a hedging strategy.Most of the new age investors are also taking a cautious call before they follow the herd.“Some coins are purely speculative, so the returns depend on market trends. Whereas blockchain-based projects are majorly dependent upon usability,” said Priya Ratnam, a 34-year-old resident of Hyderabad with an MBA degree, who started investing in crypto assets in April this year.“Average investment in 2021 was almost 30 per cent higher than 2020. Positive news around regulation across the globe and overall healthy bull cycles in assets like bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, cardano and solana contributed to this fact,” said Shivam Thakral, CEO at BuyUcoin.The exchanges are now introducing schemes similar to systematic investment plans (SIPs) to attract more nouveau investors.“We have just launched a bundled crypto SIP product, which will lower the entry barrier for investors. We have also introduced features like lending, stacking, margin-trading as part of our long-term growth strategy,” said Thakral.“We plan to launch five investment index products on our website by the end of the month. An investor can follow these indexes for investment advice,” added Hitesh Malviya, founder, itsblockchain.com.Many other exchanges are now betting big on NFTs, which the new investors have started showing interest in.“Over $108,000 worth of NFTs have been sold on our NFT Marketplace till now,” said Shetty.Among the main reasons fuelling the growth of cryptocurrencies in smaller cities are social media and aggressive marketing by influencers, experts say.The spurt in the new age investors seems to be colluding with not just the Covid-19 pandemic, where most professionals are working from home, but even positive overtures from the Indian government.“Till last year, India had around five million crypto users, which went up to 15 million, making India the third country in the world for crypto adoptions,” said Kumar Gaurav, CEO of Cashaa, an online banking platform to manage fiat and cryptocurrencies.And most of the new buyers and investors in this time have come from smaller cities, say industry trackers.Another trend that many experts have observed is the rise in the number of women who are investing. The percentage of women investors has gone up from around 15 per cent about a year ago to between 30 per cent and 40 per cent across platforms, say exchanges.Despite regulatory confusion and hiccups on the payment front, new investors are flocking to the exchanges.In September, however, in what many claim was following an informal Reserve Bank of India (RBI) diktat, State Bank of India and a few other banks decided to block the receipt of funds by crypto bourses on their Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platforms.The exchanges claim that the clampdown had no major impact on their transaction volumes as the new age investors and traders are very comfortable with the new ways, such as peer-to-peer transactions.“People have all options open to buy cryptos on our platforms,” said Sumit Gupta, co-founder & CEO at CoinDCX, a cryptocurrency exchange. “With regard to the investors’ convenience, at CoinDCX, all remittance operations are fully functional through our three payment methods — a third-party based automated route, an INR deposit via our current banking partner and through UPI transactions. Additionally, we continue to explore other payment channels to enhance convenience in line with our efforts in providing the best customer service.”","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-86335480,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-215096,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",4 min read,"Mumbai: Nirav Vyas, who works in a small accounting firm, now spends hours glued to a screen, closely tracking prices of bitcoin ethereum , solana, cardano and dogecoin.“I have nearly doubled my crypto investments in the last two months.

Investment attractiveness

Attractiveness is a more dominating variable than demand and supply in determining Bitcoin's price, according to Ladislav Kristoufek's analysis in his research paper, What are the main drivers of Bitcoin price, published in 2015.



Attractiveness could be seen as the good reputation and investment appeal of Bitcoin. It is mainly shaped by media influence and political changes .



Media Influence : Positive news published by the media about Bitcoin plays an extremely important role in garnering potential investors and increasing the consumer base for Bitcoin, especially when the the number of altcoins is growing.

Political changes: Political turmoils and economic crises often lead to increased acceptance of cryptocurrencies among the masses.



People tend to depend entirely or heavily on cryptocurrency because of its bankless transactions and future investment prospects.

Afghanistan, Nigeria, Kenya, Vietnam, Argentina are some of the countries where cryptocurrency usage is booming for sending diaspora remittances and alleviating economic distress.

Political turbulence like change of regime, hyperinflation, high poverty, unemployment, absence of financial services in these countries drove people to the adoption of Bitcoins and altcoins.





Supply and demand

To understand Bitcoin’s supply quotient, it's important to remember that Bitcoin’s total stock is finite and 90 percent of it has already been mined.

Price of Bitcoin decreases with increased stock. The stock of Bitcoins is limited, but its supply in the market can be increased by mining or solving complex algorithms.

Demand, however, has a greater impact on Bitcoin's price than supply, as bitcoins have a predetermined stock of 21 million coins. The price of Bitcoin rises with the increased demand created by more investors competing to procure the cryptocurrency. Potentially, demand for the crypto is bound to surge, and consequently price too is expected to rise in the future despite the hiccups.



Mining difficulty or Hash rates

The mining difficulty of Bitcoin or hash rate does not have any direct relation with Bitcoin prices, but it does cause a marginal impact according to Xin Li and Chong Alex Wang 's analysis in their 2017 research paper 'The Technology and Economic Determinants of Cryptocurrency Exchange Rates’.



and 's analysis in their 2017 research paper 'The Technology and Economic Determinants of Cryptocurrency Exchange Rates’. The increased hashrate actually means increased investors spending on mining hardware and electricity costs, which indirectly implies increase in price of the Bitcoin.



Policy Changes By Governments

Government policies and regulations have have a direct impact on Bitcoin prices s.



Stringent sanctions and measures have had a negative impact on Bitcoin prices in the past due to apprehensions among investors. The crackdown of China on Bitcoin in 2017 that drastically reduced the Bitcoin prices is one such example.



Adaptability of the Bitcoin users to new updates

The ease and adaptability of the Bitcoin community to new updates is another factor in increasing the popularity of Bitcoin, and thereby the prices.



Decisions made by bitcoin users to not update to the newer version causes hard fork and lead to two versions and two sets of rules.



Bitcoin Cash is the result of such a fork in 2017.

Young Indians are changing their investing habits with a change seen in the choice of assets and the way these assets are bought. These investors are not just buying bitcoin but other digital currencies as well to hedge their investments.

Popular Fintwit personality and Dogecoin enthusiast @greg16676935420 responded on Twitter that he snuck a bag of skittles into an AMC theater in protest of the company not including dogecoin in the announcement. Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus responded to Aron’s tweet to question why Litecoin was included instead of Dogecoin.

The Dogecoin Chart: Dogecoin fell in sympathy with Bitcoin and a swath of other cryptocurrencies when El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender Sept. 7. The crypto has spent the following 11 days consolidating the flash crash.

In its consolidation, Dogecoin has settled into a pennant pattern on the daily chart, making a series of lower highs and higher lows as the price range tightens. Dogecoin will reach the apex of the pennant on Sunday and if the pattern is recognized both bulls and bears should watch for increased volume for confirmation.

Dogecoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is curling slightly upwards toward the upper signal line. When MACD crosses above the signal line, it is a buy signal for technical traders because it indicates price movement is strengthening.

The crypto is trading slightly below the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) and below the 21-day EMA with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, both of which are bearish indicators. Dogecoin is also trading slightly below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) which indicates overall sentiment is bearish.

IntoTheBlock says on Twitter that $1.2 billion worth of ETH left centralized exchanges on Wednesday. The firm also notes that the last time ETH’s exchange outflows exceeded $1 billion, Ethereum’s value skyrocketed within one month.

“[The] last time $1 billion+ left CEXs (centralized exchanges), Ethereum increased by 60% within 30 days.

The second-biggest crypto by market cap is trading at $3,437.61 at time of writing, down 3.7% in the last 24 hours. However, the leading smart contract platform is up over 13% in the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko.

IntoTheBlock also highlights that Ethereum is demonstrating a high correlation with the Nasdaq stock market index, suggesting that ETH comes with higher risks and higher rewards.

“Ethereum appears to be priced as a risk-on bet. ETH has shown a high correlation to the Nasdaq, which tends to be linked with higher potential/risk investments.”

The blockchain analytics firm adds Bitcoin (BTC), by contrast, has a high correlation with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and gold. A score closer to one suggests a high correlation between two assets.

“[BTC] has moved surprisingly close to the DJIA with a correlation of 0.74 Also, worth mentioning its high 0.64 correlation to gold.”

Bitcoin is trading at $47,289.30 at time of writing and is down more than 4% in the past two weeks, though it’s up by more than 6% in the past month.

IntoTheBlock also says that the Bitcoin network has come alive after recording the largest daily BTC transaction in over 24 months, suggesting that institutional activity is on the rise.

“Large transactions on Bitcoin reached over 10 million BTC in a day for the first time in over two years.

Institutional activity appears to be in an uptrend.”

The deadline for cryptocurrency exchanges to meet the requirements to continue operations under new crypto regulations in South Korea is rapidly approaching. A total of 28 cryptocurrency exchanges have reportedly met the preliminary requirements to remain open. However, only four crypto exchanges have met the requirements to offer trading in Korean won.

28 Cryptocurrency Exchanges Meet Preliminary Regulatory Requirements

South Korea’s financial authorities have released a list of 28 cryptocurrency exchanges that have partially met the regulatory requirements to stay open past Sept. 24 under the country’s new crypto regulations.

The amended Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information requires cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain Information Security Management System (ISMS) certification by Sept. 24 and submit a report to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a division of the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Crypto exchanges that fail to do so must cease operations by Sept. 24.

Jeon Yo-seop, head of FIU’s Planning and Coordination Office, explained that given the approaching deadline:

It is unlikely that there will be additional certified virtual asset trading platforms.

The 28 exchanges that have been ISMS-certified include Gopax, Upbit, Korbit, Coinone, Bithumb, Hanbitco, Casherest, Tennten, Dove Wallet, Flybit, Gdak, Aprobit, Huobi, Coin&coin, Probit, Borabit, Coredax, and Okbit.

However, in order for crypto exchanges to offer trading in Korean won (KRW), they must also partner with banks to offer customers real-name verification deposit/withdrawal accounts.

So far, only the country’s top four crypto exchanges — Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit — have been able to secure partnerships with banks, which have been reluctant to partner with crypto exchanges due to risks including money laundering.

Crypto businesses that do not have banking partners to provide real-name verification deposit/withdrawal accounts must terminate the trading in the KRW market even if they have received ISMS certification. That means 24 out of the 28 exchanges will be crypto-only exchanges.

Financial authorities in South Korea have also distributed business closure guidelines to the cryptocurrency industry. Exchanges must notify users of the expected closing date and how they can withdraw their funds at least seven days before the closing date. They must also provide a window of at least 30 days from the closing date to allow users to withdraw their funds. Korean authorities are also reportedly monitoring crypto exchanges that are likely to shut down to ensure they return funds to customers.

2021-09-19T12:01:32.251459 12:00:24,Markets Insider,"Solana's network crashed this week, but developers say the DeFi altcoin is still on track to succeed as an alternative to ethereum",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/solana-versus-ethereum-crypto-star-atlas-network-crash-blockchain-outage-2021-9,"In this photo illustration a Solana logo seen displayed on a smartphone with binary code on a laptop screen Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images

Solana has attracted developers as a faster and cheaper blockchain than Ethereum.

The founder of one major Solana-based project said he's not discouraged by the network's outage earlier this week.

Insider also spoke with a partner at a crypto investment fund, who sees a ""multi blockchain world"" where solana, ethereum, and other networks coexist.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Michael Wagner has large ambitions for his blockchain-based multiplayer game, Star Atlas. He sees his beta-stage product where players explore outer space eventually morphing into a ""metaverse,"" and told Insider he wants the user base to expand to ""the entire global population.""

A game that can support that kind of user base needs a web-scale, layer one blockchain protocol that's scalable and low-cost, Wagner said. That's why he and his team chose to build Star Atlas on solana in August 2020, joining about 20 other projects that had been built on the blockchain.

A year later, Wagner says there's over 500 projects built on the network, and solana's SOL token has soared to over $150, boasting a year-to-date gain of nearly 8,300%.

The gain has been in part driven by developers like Wagner, who were looking for a network that could process transactions faster and cheaper than ethereum, the blockchain where most decentralized projects currently exist.

While solana was processing 2,000 transactions per second on Friday, ethereum was only processing about 14, and while each transaction costs about $5 on ethereum, solana boasts a transaction fee of less than a penny.

Developer interest and activity on solana grew so much over the last few months that the network's transaction load peaked on Sept 14, resulting in an outage of over 17 hours. The company said ''intermittent instability"" had disrupted some services on Tuesday, after solana's transaction load peaked at 400,000 transactions per second.



The network is back up and running now, and Wagner said he wasn't discouraged by the outage, but rather impressed with the network's ""expediency of resolution.""



""Solana was capable of handling greater than 400,000 transactions per second prior to the failure, which is being rapidly resolved, "" Wagner said. ""This demonstrates the true potential of a web scalable blockchain, and furthers my resolve in building Star Atlas with solana as the foundational protocol.""

In the wake of the outage, investors may be wondering where solana will fit into the ecosystem of layer-one blockchains, especially as ethereum stands as the dominant platform for decentralized applications.

Seth Ginns, managing partner at investment firm CoinFund, sees a ""multi-blockchain world,"" where developers examine the trade-offs of each protocol and choose to build their project on whichever blockchain best provides what they need.

Traditional financial applications that need fast transaction speeds are well suited for Solana, Ginns told Insider. Meanwhile, applications that need strong censorship resistance or a more decentralized protocol may be better suited on ethereum, he said.

Ethereum will soon undergo a massive upgrade known as ""Ethereum 2.0,"" which will culminate in the blockchain pivoting to a proof-of-stake concept, among other technical updates. That could change how it stacks up against solana, Ginns said, but before that upgrade, developers are flocking to what works for them.

""Both from a utilization perspective and an investor awareness perspective we're seeing solana really come into one of the top positions among base layers,"" Ginns said. ""That's likely to remain the case, even as ethereum goes through upgrades.""

However he noted that solana is still a fraction of ethereum's network value, and the token is unlikely to unseat the second largest cryptocurrency any time soon.

""We have a saying, 'you never bet against ethereum,'"" Ginns said. ""It would be surprising to me if you ever hear me completely writing off ethereum. It just has such a vibrant developer community.""","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/6144ce16e47d9100195ba18a?format=jpeg',)",3 min read,"The founder of one major Solana-based project said he's not discouraged by the network's outage earlier this week.

Although the legendary creator's identity is still a mystery to the world, the bronze statue acknowledges the immense contribution to the disruption of traditional currency. It has been put on display at Graphishop Park, Budapest. The sculpture is the bust of a person wearing a hoodie that has the Bitcoin (BTC) logo engraved on it. The face has been sculpted with vague features to represent Satoshi Nakamoto's anonymity. A video features a crowd of people surrounding the statue and clicking photos and videos during the ceremony.

The unveiling ceremony saw the presence of Andras Gyorfi, the co-founder of the ""Statue of Satoshi"" project and editor of crypto news site Kripto Akademia, and Debreczeni Barnabas, CEO of Hungarian crypto exchange Shinrai. Both of them addressed the crowd at the ceremony.

Before the bronze statue was unveiled, Gyorfi said, ""Whoever he or she was, Bitcoin creates value, and especially the technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain, creates value.""

According to a report by Cointelegraph, Barnabas said, ""Satoshi Nakamoto has created an independent money free of any middlemen that empowered people with financial sovereignty... We have erected this statue to remind ourselves courage is virtue. We need to keep on dreaming big.""

The ""Statue of Satoshi"" project was first announced in May. It was backed by Coin, Kripto Akademia, the Blockchain Hungary Association, and Blockchain Budapest. Sculptors Gergely Reka and Tamas Gilly intentionally gave a mirror-like sheen to the statue's face. Perhaps, their purpose was to represent the idea that ""we are all Satoshi"".

WE ARE ALL SATOSHI — PUREBLOOD KAZ (@btcKaz) September 16, 2021

Reports suggest that the statue will be placed in the park near the sculptures of notable figures like Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.

Users are already gushing about the event. Some have started worshipping the Bitcoin creator in many ways.

Users will also be able to access real-time prices and educational content related to cryptocurrency. However, crypto trading will only be available to customers with verified accounts. This is the first expansion of crypto trading on PayPal outside the US, where the service was launched in November 2020.

The company said that all eligible PayPal customers in the UK can now buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BitcoinCash, and Litecoin.

We are delighted to share that all eligible customers in the UK can now buy, hold and sell #Cryptocurrencies #Bitcoin, #Ethereum, #BitcoinCash & #Litecoin from their PayPal account. Look out for it in the PayPal app. — PayPal UK (@PayPalUK) September 17, 2021

In late August, PayPal announced plans to move into the British crypto market and soon began rolling out the services. This latest tweet is a culmination of that process. During the previous announcement, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal Vice President and General Manager of blockchain, crypto, and digital currencies, said the company's global reach and digital payments expertise provide it a “unique opportunity” to help people in the UK to explore cryptocurrency.

“The pandemic has accelerated digital change and innovation across all aspects of our lives— including the digitisation of money and greater consumer adoption of digital financial services,” he said.

The British customers of PayPal will now be able to fund crypto purchases using their bank account or debit card and can buy any of these four virtual currencies for as little as 1 euro.

The PayPal official said the American multinational is committed to working closely with British regulators to meaningfully contribute to shaping the role of digital currencies in the global financial system.

PayPal says it has over 375 million daily active users and 30 million merchants on the platform. While the company does not charge any fee for holding cryptocurrency, it is charging users for transactions and currency conversions.

Details Here,https://www.news18.com/news/business/cryptocurrency-update-5-crypto-coins-gain-up-to-500-in-24-hours-details-here-4217477.html,"The global cryptocurrency market has seen a rally recently. According to data analysed from CoinMarketCap, the global crypto market, at the time of this article, stood at $2.18 trillion with an increase of 0.84 per cent over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours was $99.11 billion, which also pointed to a decline of 9.47 per cent. However, having said that, there have been several cryptocurrencies that have been trading green and even rallying to new heights over the course of the last few days.

For instance, over the course of this past week, Friday especially, Dogecoin and SHIBA INU were two cryptocurrencies that really rallied and saw a surge in the market. The reason behind those coins gaining specifically was Elon Musk. More accurately it was musk’s puppy. Ever since the business tycoon and Tesla CEO announced the name and most recently the arrival of his new Shiba Inu pup on Twitter, the cryptocurrency market and the investors therein have been rushing for Dogecoin and SHIBA. This was the famous ‘Musk’ effect at work.

This Musk effect has been so ‘effective’ that Dogecoin has jumped up all the way to 9th place on CoinMarketCap with a price of $0.2442. Though at the time of this article the coin showed to be trading red at 3.01 per cent over the past day, the change over the course of the week was 1.91 per cent up. Similarly, SHIBA INU had jumped 21 per cent on Friday according to information on Coinbase, as reported by Techstory.

With this in mind, there have also been several underdog crypto coins that have seen immense gains over the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap. These cryptocurrencies have surged will over the triple-digit mark and stand in a range of around 200 per cent to almost 500 per cent.

Top 5 Cryptocurrency Gainers (According to data from CoinMarketCap)

1) Gravitoken - $0.00114 – 499.25 per cent change over the last 24 hours

2) Around Network - $990.82 – 350.14 per cent change over the last 24 hours

3) Biconomy Exchange Token - $0.00003486 – 276.14 per cent change over the last 24 hour

4) Greenex - $0.03983 – 274.86 per cent change over the last 24 hours

5) Bridge Oracle - $0.0008047 – 186.49 per cent change over the last 24 hours

Now, coming to the relatively well-known cryptocurrencies in the market, data indicated that Bitcoin was performing quite well on Saturday with a price nearly touching $50,000. The price of Bitcoin at the time of this article was $48,519.23 which was trading green at 1.60 per cent over the course of the last 24 hours. The change over the course of the week for the top ghost coin was 7.38 per cent. Data from CoinMarketCap indicated that the Bitcoin market dominance was 42.12 per cent and saw an increase of 0.37 per cent over the day.

Ethereum was trading 0.10 per cent down with a price of $3,508.47. Similarly, a good chunk of the other top coins were actually trading red for the past 24 hours. Here is the list.

Bitcoin - $48,519.23 with a change of +1.60 per cent over the last 24 hours

Ether - $3,508.47 with a change of -0.10 per cent over the last 24 hours

2021-09-19T12:01:36.198227 12:00:24,The Daily Hodl,"Calm Before the Storm? Here’s What’s Next for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano, According to Top Analyst Michaël van de Poppe",https://dailyhodl.com/2021/09/18/calm-before-the-storm-heres-whats-next-for-bitcoin-ethereum-and-cardano-according-to-top-analyst-michael-van-de-poppe/,"Widely followed crypto trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe is mapping out the price levels to watch for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA).

In a new market update, Van de Poppe tells his 127,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin recently reclaimed a key price area, indicating that Bitcoin is gearing up for a fresh rally.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Yesterday, we’ve had a beautiful retest, so price broke back above the range ($47,000-$50,000), and we’ve actually retested the levels that I wanted ($47,000), and that’s very normal to be having at this stage in which we get some consolidation going on the Bitcoin markets…

So for me, this entire region between $46,000-$47,000 is very crucial to watch, through which as long as we stay above it, we could be seeing continuation towards the range highs, which is $50,000, and then I am assuming we are going to get some sideways action, through which altcoins will be doing absolutely great. And once we break above $50,000, I think Bitcoin will be grinding all the way back up towards a new all-time high.”

Taking a look at Ethereum (ETH), Van de Poppe says he wants to see the $3,400 level hold as support before moving towards new highs.

“This is the level I’m looking at, which is very similar to the Bitcoin level between $46,000-$47,000. If this holds and we see we are reversing the trend at this stage with Ethereum, I think we are going to have continuation towards the range high, which is around $3,840 towards 4,000.”

Against Bitcoin, the trader notes that ETH has been consolidating below the 0.077 BTC level ($3,630). The crypto trader says he’s looking for the ETH/BTC to find support at 0.072 BTC ($3,394).

“So the critical level for Ethereum to watch is this entire region that we have around 0.072 BTC ($3,394), and if that holds I think we’re going to have new highs relatively soon.”

Finally, Van de Poppe highlights Cardano (ADA). The crypto strategist says that despite Cardano’s lackluster performance over the past week, he’s expecting further upside after it establishes a new support level following the launch of smart contracts on the blockchain.

“As long as Cardano is going to stay above that level of $1.90, I think it’s going to continue moving. Right now, it’s just finding a new equilibrium after the fact that we had the smart contracts launched, and that is usually going with a slight corrective move before we’re going to have a continuation.”

Laos has authorized a series of cryptocurrency mining and trading projects in the country, looking for another source of income to supplement the losses caused by the drop in tourism due to COVID-19 related measures. Six companies have been authorized to start cryptocurrency trading and mining operations in the country, according to the office of the prime minister.

Laos Embraces Digital Currencies

Laos has authorized mining and trading operations in its territory, contradicting policies from its central bank that issued warnings against crypto just a month before. The move comes as the small Asian nation tries to find alternative income sources to deal with the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The office of the prime minister stated that six companies were now authorized to conduct cryptocurrency-related activities in the country. Now, according to reports, the government will start work to regulate these activities. Laos could also be trying to attract some of the miners ousted from China, by being a close substitute that can also offer plenty of cheap, hydroelectric power currently not being used at its full potential.

Green Mining Potential and Money Laundering Concerns

The origin of this clean energy could also be a big attraction now that people are more aware of the mining industry’s heavy energy consumption. This push for green energy and renewables for mining was, in part, introduced by Elon Musk, who commented that the Bitcoin network energy consumption was “insane,” and suspended bitcoin payments for cars at Tesla.

This might be a lifesaver for Laos, as its own energy consumption is orders of magnitudes lower than what the country produces, making it easy to introduce a mining industry without disrupting the national electrical grid.

However, regulators have concerns. Laos sits in an area that is very famous for the volume of narcotics produced there. Many are worried that the rise in these industries might translate to cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering purposes. Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, declared to news outlet FT that:

You should always be concerned when countries with poor regulatory records start to get involved in things like cryptocurrency. To say that the Laotian financial system is immature would be a brutal understatement, and we have to be concerned if they are rushing into this.

NEW DELHI: The rallying cry for using cryptocurrency in the West and Europe could well be about investing in the most lucrative and stable digital asset for long-term investment.But in developing countries, with a shifting economy, people resort to cryptocurrency in dire economic conditions, for sending diaspora remittances or seeking financial relief from spiralling unemployment.Separate surveys - conducted by Statista in March 2021 and Finder and Chainalysis in August 2021 - on cryptocurrency ownership, adoption and usage ranked such developing countries among the top 20.Nigeria in South Africa, Vietnam and Philippines in SouthEast Asia and Venezuela and Argentina in Latin America were key names thrown up by the survey.This country had the highest cryptocurrency usage at 32 percent according to the Statista global survey in March 2021.Stiff regulations and high fees charged on inflowing remittances, made cryptocurrency the obvious choice of Nigerian expatriates for sending money across borders to their families.Strangely, Nigeria’s official records showed a consistent and sharp decline in the remittances inflow from $2.5 billion in January 2021 to $54.4 million in September 2021.However, remittances kept coming in through the private cryptocurrency services. Currently the government plans to launch its own e-naira for replacing cryptocurrency.The economic crisis of this country pales into insignificance in comparison to its indomitable zeal for prospering through cryptocurrency services. It was ranked top in the Chainalysis Adoption Index.Earlier Vietnam’s cryptocurrency usage was dominated by the need to send remittances to families for support, while now it's being diverted for future investment.In September 2021, Vietnam saw a resurgence of crypto mining activity and demand for mining rigs with the price rises of altcoins and Bitcoin . However, crypto mining is still not a regulated activity in Vietnam.The Philippines is among the top five countries in the world to receive remittances from overseas according to the World Bank , with an annual remittance of $32.5 billion.Acknowledging the impact of cryptocurrencies in revolutionizing the country's diaspora remittances and fundraising opportunities, the Central Bank of Philippines approved several crypto exchanges to operate as remittance and transfer companies in the country. The cryptocurrency adoption increased here for both investment and income generation.Fillipinos also constitute 40 percent of over 1 million Axie Infinity gamers. In the face of rampant unemployment post-pandemic, many locals looked up to this as an economic opportunity. Axie Infinity, a crypto-based play-to-earn game, provided relief to the jobless in the Philippines, Brazil and Venezuela.Sky-rocketing inflation in 2020, below $10 minimum wage, and cheap electricity of Venezuela have collectively propelled the crypto boom in this country.Cryptocurrencies are an easy and affordable way for the 5 million Venezuelan diaspora to send remittances home.Cheap power has ushered in flourishing crypto mining activity.

Way back in 2013, Bitcoin was worth only about $100. Since then, it has enjoyed an all-time high price of almost $65,000 per Bitcoin. Even today, Bitcoin is worth almost $50,000 per Bitcoin!

A lot of people became very rich by investing in Bitcoin. Other people who doubted the viability of cryptocurrency quickly changed their minds in response to the huge success of Bitcoin. Now that more people are getting into the cryptocurrency game, they are creating many other coins to compete with Bitcoin.

So which of the less famous cryptocurrency stocks is the best one to invest in? Read on to learn all about how you can find the best investment opportunities in cryptocurrency!

Bitcoin

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and it is still the largest. It has made more millionaires and billionaires than any other cryptocurrency. Many people turn to bitcoin for what they feel is a safe investment.

On the other hand, since Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, it is also not very high tech. Other currencies provide many inancial tools, like smart contracts. In contrast, Bitcoin doesn’t really do anything except act as a medium of exchange.

Ethereum

Ethereum is the second-largest of all cryptocurrencies. It got that way by providing financial tools that Bitcoin didn’t. Ethereum allows for smart contracts.

Smart contracts are contracts that execute themselves without requiring a person to manage the execution. This is much safer than relying on a person to execute a contract since not everybody is trustworthy.

This is especially relevant in some countries where there are not trustworthy insurance companies. Some farmers live without crop insurance because they do not have a local insurance provider that they can trust.

But with the power of smart contracts, farmers can buy contracts and know that they will be honored. Insurance is only one financial tool like this. Ethereum smart contracts are the foundation of dozens of apps and financial tools.

Cardano

Cardano is the third biggest cryptocurrency. It is attempting to replace Ethereum, and maybe even Bitcoin. Ethereum is expensive, while Cardano is cheap. Cardano does not yet offer smart contracts, but it is about to start.

That may allow it to suddenly increase in value, making it a potential investment opportunity.

Of course, the best cryptocurrency stock 2021 has available is not going to always be the best cryptocurrency stock. If you have ever asked, “What is cryptocurrency?”, then one of the first things you should know about cryptocurrency stock prices is that they can change very quickly.

It is important to have tools that allow you to move significant amounts of money in and out of crypto quickly. To learn more about what is cryptocurrency and how you can buy and sell it, check out Byte Federal.

2021-09-18T12:01:40.995256 12:00:24,NDTV.com,Here's How Cryptocurrency Differs From Traditional Investing Options,https://www.ndtv.com/business/cryptocurrency-vs-traditional-investing-options-know-the-differences-2542935,"When it comes to investment, people in India generally opt for something where they can avail maximum returns within a specific time frame and with minimum risks involved. Although there are plenty of conventional investment options such as stocks and bonds, many Indians are slowly but surely warming up to the idea of cryptocurrencies, a digital form of currency that can be used to exchange value in the future. While the Reserve Bank of India had, in 2018, banned all regulated banks from holding or facilitating cryptocurrency transactions following reports of digital currency frauds, the Supreme Court struck it down in March 2020.

Following the reversal of the ban, Indians seem to be increasingly looking at cryptocurrency as a viable investment option. But how is it different from traditional options? Let's take a look.

Cryptocurrency vs Stocks

Let's start by discussing the difference between cryptocurrency and the stock market. Both cryptocurrency and stocks have their good and bad days. However, stocks have a long history that makes it easier for investors to predict the future. Stocks face different kinds of risks including business and financial, market volatility, government regulations among others. However, cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are a decentralised structure. They don't have a government or a group of people controlling it.

Cryptocurrency vs Bonds

Bonds are a loan from a person to a company or a government. In other words, when an investor buys bonds, the company or government from where the bonds have been bought is in debt to that person. The investor will get an interest on the amount for a period of time after which the company or the government will pay back the entire amount. The major risk with bonds is that if the company goes bankrupt, the investor will stop receiving interest payments and even the principal amount.

Cryptocurrency vs Forex

Forex, also known as foreign exchange, usually attracts investors investing in foreign currencies. Cryptocurrency is a globally accepted form of currency and the investors who opt for foreign exchange also deal globally. But here the catch is the different economic conditions of the countries. Investors can expect positive results from forex only when the economy of the country they are investing in is in a good state. The capital gains for forex can be gauged only on the basis of the economy of the respective country. This makes it riskier as compared to cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency vs Precious Metals

We know in today's time, the main reason why people consider precious metals to invest in, is to buy jewellery and other such items. So, the only value determiner of metals like gold and silver is the market sentiment. Now, let's talk about the risks. The risks involved with investing in precious metals include their portability, import taxes and last, but not least, their need for tight security. Whereas, cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, don't need anyone to physically transfer them. Since it is all digital, it makes it comparatively easier for the investor.

Cryptocurrency vs Fixed Deposits

Fixed deposits are supported by the government. FDs are good when you have a long-term investment plan when you have to wait till maturity. However, those who exit their FDs before they mature, might as well go ahead and invest in cryptocurrency. At least, the market is volatile there and people can make quick decisions. People can exit when they know the market prices are going down while dealing with cryptocurrency. But having said that, no extra effort of mining is required for FDs. Cryptocurrencies need to be mined. They need investors' time and attention. Whereas, for FDs, you can forget it after investment till it gets mature.

Although people are much comfortable and aware of the traditional investment plans, cryptocurrencies are new and can have their own pros and cons. So, choose wisely.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-04/q7d8b2k8_bitcoin_625x300_06_April_21.jpg',)",3 min read,"Cryptocurrency vs StocksLet's start by discussing the difference between cryptocurrency and the stock market.

The global cryptocurrency market has always enjoyed a lot of attention ever since it came into existence. Gone are the days when only a select range of investors were keen on investing in cryptocurrencies. Today, the manner in which retail investors are diversifying their investment portfolio and shifting their gear towards cryptocurrency investment is definitely worth a mention. Investing in cryptocurrencies is definitely worth it for you the returns you’d make in the long run would be on the higher side. On that note, we have come up with a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to buy this weekend. Have a look!

Bitcoin

How can the list of top cryptocurrencies to invest in not start with Bitcoin? No matter what is the situation of the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin has always managed to gain the trust of investors. Despite the downfall of the cryptocurrency market in April 2021, Bitcoin bouncing back to normal talks volumes about how good of an investment it is.

Ethereum

This cryptocurrency being one of the top investments doesn’t seem to surprise anyone. In addition to being the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, yet another reason as to why Ethereum enjoys attention is because of its ability to support DeFi – Decentralized Finance.

Polkadot

Polkadot is that one cryptocurrency that has a clear-cut objective – delivering interoperability among other blockchains. Yet another aspect that sets this cryptocurrency apart from the rest is the fact that in addition to creating decentralized applications, the developers can create their own blockchain while also using the security that Polkadot’s chain already has. In September 2021, Polkadot’s market capitalization stood at about $35 billion.

IOTA

IOTA, as the name suggests, is a cryptocurrency built for the Internet of Things (IoT). It stores transactions on its ledger using a directed acyclic graph. A point worth mentioning is that this marketplace has been set up to allow businesses to sell data in order to promote data sharing. Additionally, this marketplace is block-less, thereby implying that all network transactions are free. All in all, a good buy this one turns out to be!

Cardano

Scalability, interoperability, high speed, flexibility, sustainability – you name it and Cardano excels at all of these. Recently, an update that added the ability to build smart contracts has opened doors for the developers to work on dApps and DeFi. With low transaction fees and huge potential to grow in the days ahead, Cardano is that one cryptocurrency you shouldn’t miss out on.

Dogecoin

Words can merely do justice to the prominence that this cryptocurrency has enjoyed over the last couple of months – thanks to Elon Musk. Today, we have reached the stage wherein Dogecoin is considered to be one of the most viable investment options. What are you waiting for?

Uniswap

Uniswap holds the potential to enable the users to trade Ethereum tokens via liquidity pools. One of the many reasons as to why this cryptocurrency makes it into the list of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in is because this coin has already reached major milestones, and it is now one of the DeFi coins to enter the top race.

Stellar

Stellar is majorly aimed at simplifying the payments. All the cross-currency payments couldn’t have got easier had it not been for Stellar. Its collaboration with International Business Machine Inc to create IBM World Wire has paved the way for fast currency transfer services to financial institutions across the world.

Chainlink

The prime objective of this cryptocurrency is to make a decentralized oracle network that can serve as a middleman between smart contracts and data sources. Its security, trustworthiness, reliability, etc. are the reasons why it is one of the most sought after investment options.

XRP

If you are in search of a fast and secure payment that works globally then XRP is the one for you. One of the most remarkable features of this cryptocurrency is that its payment system holds the potential to compete with legacy systems like SWIFT and convert crypto to any fiat currency. No wonder, why it is considered to be one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Crypto-trading.jpeg',)",3 min read,"Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to Buy this WeekendThe global cryptocurrency market has always enjoyed a lot of attention ever since it came into existence.

The smart contract platform Avalanche (AVAX) is trading at $65.02 at time of writing, having achieved an all-time high of $68.34 at one point on Thursday, according to CoinGecko.

The Avalanche Foundation also announced on Thursday that it had completed a $230 million private token sale to a slew of blockchain asset investment firms, crypto hedge funds, angel investors, and family offices, including Polychain Capital and Three Arrows Capital.

The foundation plans to allocate this money into expanding decentralized finance (DeFi), enterprise applications, and other use cases on the Avalanche public blockchain. The sale was completed in June.

According to Avalanche Foundation director Emin Gün Sirer,

“Despite being years younger than its peers, Avalanche has quickly turned promise and potential into real-world impact and value creation for DeFi users and developers.

The community of builders rallying around the network is a testament to its competitive edge, and there is still so much potential yet to be tapped at the intersection of institutional and decentralized finance on Avalanche.”

Recent research from the early-stage venture capital firm Outlier Ventures indicates that Avalanche has demonstrated explosive growth in terms of developer activity during the past year.

2021-09-18T12:01:53.835764 12:00:24,Benzinga,$1.2B of ETH Disappeared From Exchanges Yesterday — Or Did It? - Ethereum - United States Dollar ($ETH),https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/09/22991457/1-2b-of-eth-disappeared-from-exchanges-yesterday-or-did-it,"Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) on-chain metrics are painting a rather bullish picture as exchanges hold less and less of the coin's supply.

What Happened: According to a Thursday tweet by on-chain data firm IntoTheBlock, the net amount of Ether leaving centralized cryptocurrency exchanges just hit a new record of more than $1.2 billion on Sept 15. The last time this metric reached over $1 billion, Ethereum's price increased by 60% within 30 days.

Still, not everyone is fully convinced. One Twitter user raised the question ""how do we know large portions of this aren't just exchanges shuffling to their new wallets,"" to which IntoTheBlock answered that their machine learning-based artificial intelligence algorithms classify the wallets to avoid this from happening. The user was unsatisfied with the answer, highlighting that he cannot verify how well the algorithm classifies the wallet addresses.

Data from competing on-chain data service Glassnode shows no significant uptake in Ethereum's outflow from exchanges on Sept 15.

In fact, the data discrepancy is so great that Glassnode's net transfer volume chart for Ether shows on Sept 15 more coins were transferred onto exchanges than out of them.

It is unclear which data source is right. It is entirely possible IntoTheBlock failed to filter out some crypto exchange's internal transactions or Glassnode wasn't aware of the exchange wallets from which the bulk of the outflow originated.

Despite all of this, Glassnode data still shows the percentage of Ethereum's supply held on cryptocurrency exchanges is in a clear downtrend, suggesting that investors are increasingly deciding to hold it for the long term. This metric currently stands at just under 13%, up from Aug 23's 12.8% but also significantly down from late May's 15.3%.

Though it's been one of the year's fastest-appreciating cryptocurrencies, Solana's sol token has given up much of its massive gains this week, plunging more than 35% from last week’s record high following a network outage that some experts believe could bolster the case for more-established platforms like Ethereum.

Ethereum prices have ticked up about 4% since Solana's outage, but their return of roughly 370% this ... [+] year pales in comparison to sol's gain of nearly 7,800%. Getty Images

Key Facts

Sol tanked as much as 10% Friday to $135.25, marking the token's lowest level in nearly two weeks and pushing its market value to about $40.6 billion, more than $20 billion below its high on September 9. Though the token initially rose during a crypto crash last week, prices started falling over the weekend as the broader market struggled to pare losses, with the selloff quickly intensifying Tuesday morning after a surge in transaction volume and bot activity sparked outages on Solana's network for more than 17 hours. In a statement, Solana said the flood of transactions led to excessive memory consumption that the network's engineers were unable to remedy, so a group of core developers decided to upgrade and restart the network, which helped restore the blockchain's functionality early Wednesday morning. In a Friday note, Oanda analyst Edward Moya said Solana's outage and its fix showed it is ""far from unstoppable"" and not as decentralized, or self-sufficient, as some investors may have believed. He notes sol's recent price woes could help Ethereum cement its leadership over the short-term and may ultimately be ""good news"" for other blockchains that support smart contracts, the self-executing agreements underpinning the technology behind buzzy non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance. Ethereum prices have ticked up about 4% since the outage, but their return of roughly 370% this year pales in comparison to Solana's gain of nearly 7,800%.

Contra

Several cryptocurrency experts came to Solana's defense after its outage, with some even pointing to similar problems during Ethereum's initial rollout. ""We're still in the early days of building fast scalable blockchains,"" Emin Gün Sirer, a Cornell University computer science professor, tweeted Wednesday, adding: ""Issues can happen."" Meanwhile, ​​Kyle Samani, a managing partner at cryptocurrency investment firm Multicoin Capital, on Friday said developer activity and the flow of money on Solana's blockchain are still growing at an ""astounding rate,"" making the nascent platform one of the strongest Ethereum competitors despite its recent volatility. ""I don't think [Ethereum] can be displaced, but it's very clear Solana is going to coexist with it,"" Samani told crypto investor Anthony Pompliano.

What To Watch For

Solana says it will continue to deploy fixes to help prevent future instability and has promised to give a ""detailed post mortem"" on the outage in ""the coming weeks.""

Key Background

Solana’s stunning rally this year has headlined growth among a slew of so-called altcoins, or cryptocurrency alternatives to market leaders bitcoin and ether. Alongside cryptocurrencies like binance coin and Cardano's ada, Solana's support for smart contracts has helped it take advantage of the booming market around NFTs, which posted record-breaking sales of $900 million last month. While some laud the growth as a natural step for adoption, others aren't so sure the surging altcoins are minting sustainable gains. In a note earlier this month, JPMorgan analysts warned bitcoin's dwindling share of the cryptocurrency market likely reflects ""froth and retail investor mania,"" and pointed out such mania has historically resulted in corrections of nearly 50%.

2021-09-18T12:01:55.547886 12:00:24,Khaleej Times,"Cryptocurrency, blockchain ventures top VC investments",https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/cryptocurrency-blockchain-ventures-top-vc-investments,"Venture Capitalists (VCs) globally are investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain ventures as the digital disruption catalyses the windfall complemented with a rebound from the pandemic.

The first half of this year itself saw investments surge to more than double the whole of 2020, according to KPMG’s Pulse of Fintech study. So why the rush? Will we see the trend spilling over to the Middle East?

Arshad Khan, chief executive officer of Arabian Bourse, said: “There has been an increase in VC investments in the virtual asset industry in recent years. Motivated by the significant technological capabilities amidst a growing public acceptance and endorsement of the cryptocurrencies, venture capital funds around the world have sought to increase their stake and exposure in the space, with billions of dollars invested into exchanges, digital asset infrastructure providers, virtual assets funds, and digital wallet companies.”

Khan adds: “Moreover, the global trend has also manifested in the Middle East, with notable VC investments taking place including that of UAE-based crypto investment funds which are getting active. Increasing institutional participation on the buy and sell-side is also driving VC interest.”

For instance, Rain — licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain as a crypto asset brokerage — has raised $17.9 million to date from investors like MEVP, Coinbase, and many others. Kristin Lorie, VP of Marketing at Rain, said: “At Rain, we believe the cryptocurrency industry will be as transformative, if not more, than the internet. What the internet did to data, we believe cryptocurrencies will do to finance, banking, and markets. With such a large addressable market and the market still being so early, VC investments across the globe will only continue to rise as more and more people figure out the above.”

KPMG highlights that a significant amount of institutional money flowed into the crypto space, showing the broadening of the investor base. Investor awareness and knowledge of the sector is growing, with investors now having a much better understanding not only about crypto assets, but also the operational and procedural side of crypto — from custody and storage to storekeeping and the competitiveness and maturity of service providers.

Gabriel Abed, Ambassador of Barbados to the UAE, said: “The rise of crypto VCs in the space is coming from an understanding that the future is clearly in the direction of blockchain innovation. The projects that we have seen over the years are now exiting experimentation phases and entering into the real market utility which is ultimately attracting institutional investors. The main attribution for this is the legitimacy of the industry and the fact that it can no longer be ignored by governments, regulators or institutions.”

VC investment was very strong in the blockchain and crypto space as numerous companies raised $100 million-plus funding rounds, including BlockFi ($350 million), Paxos ($300 million), Blockchain.com ($300 million), and Bitso ($250 million). China has continued to move forward with testing its central bank digital currency (the ‘digital renminbi’, digital yuan, or e-CNY).

In the remaining of H2’21 continued maturation of the cryptocurrency space is expected with stronger separation between cryptocurrencies; use of blockchain technologies; and evolution of exchanges focused on areas such as NFTs.

Frederick Pye, chairman, and CEO, 3iQ Corp shares that he has spent 13 years into the great blockchain experiment and has witnessed significant maturation and growth in the technology and industry since Satoshi’s groundbreaking whitepaper in 2008.

Obviously, the headlines are around the price of the bigger blockchain assets like BTC and ETH, but the true mark of progress is the actual use of blockchain in solutions that are objectively better than what could be built with traditional technology.

“We’re starting to finally see the launch of some solutions that are natively built on blockchain, but with enough polish and security to capture mainstream use. Stablecoins (digital assets backed by traditional fiat held in a bank) are an excellent transition step. As the price headlines continue to drive interest and additional powerful solutions using the technology continue to get rolled out and adopted, this trend is just getting started,” said Pye.

Pye has been a very strong supporter of cryptocurrency and says the VCs venturing in the crypto space is the most important venture trend of the last 30 years.

“In the past, venture cycles have been focused on technologies leveraging traditional network and database structures. The core technology evolved, but most innovation was in front-end, consumer, and enterprise-facing solutions. Despite piggybacking of existing core technology, these venture cycles still took 5-7 years to grow and mature. The blockchain industry is actually looking to remake the core fundamentals that we build technology on top of. This is incredibly exciting and offers an avenue to remake most industries vertical with objectively better solutions, however, it will take a longer time for the trend to grow and mature. As a team that has been in the industry since 2012, it is very gratifying to see an ever-increasing flow of global capital be willing and interested in making that investment,” concludes Pye.

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts unveiled what they say is the world's first statue of mystery-shrouded Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, at a park in Budapest, Hungary.

The expressionless, ultra-shiny bust is meant to represent ""a general human figure, since we do not know the gender, race, age [or] height of the mysterious developer,"" the creators of the project wrote on a website set up for the statue's debut.

The creation of the monument to the digital currency legend was led by Andras Gyofi, the editor of a Hungarian cryptocurrency news site, as well as other key players in the Central European nation's digital currency space.

The statue features a hoodie-clad figure constructed of bronze, but the face features a special bronze-aluminum composite so ""every visitor can see their own face when looking at Satoshi,"" the project organizers wrote. The art was the work of two Hungarian sculptors, Gergely Reka and Tamas Gilly, who decided to make the reflective face to represent a concept of ""We are all Satoshi.""

A global debate has ensued for years as to who the actual person or persons behind the iconic pseudonym is. Despite many people claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto -- and a handful of others being called him by investigative reporters -- the actual original author of the whitepaper that launched Bitcoin in 2008 has not been identified.

Given Bitcoin's meteoric rise over the past decade or so -- a single bitcoin worth about $600 five years ago now is worth more than $47,000 -- Satoshi Nakamoto may have become a billionaire as cryptocurrency became more mainstream. Earlier this month, El Salvador became the first nation in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.

The mythic nature of the Bitcoin creator only seems to lend to his revered status among crypto evangelists. Gyorfi, who spearheaded the project, told The Associated Press that Nakamoto is the ""god of our market"" and about $10,000 in cryptocurrency donations was collected to build the statue.

A large crowd turned out to view the unveiling of the statue on Thursday in Graphisoft Park, a business park in Hungary's capital city. The statue is available for public viewing, free of charge.

The sculpture's creators look at Bitcoin as ""much more"" than just a cryptocurrency, and said they sought to honor the ""very important legacy"" of its creator.

""The underlying technology, blockchain that Satoshi Nakamoto introduced to the world, can truly make our life better,"" they wrote on their website. ""Transparency, fairness, several other values in numerous fields, this is what blockchain truly means.""","('https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/bitcoin-statue-01-gty-iwb-210917_1631887312854_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg',)",2 min read,"The reflective art piece allows viewers to see themselves in Satoshi Nakamoto.

Ether's fair value is around $1,500 based on measures of network activity, a JPMorgan strategist has said.

That's roughly 55% lower than Friday's price of around $3,470 for ethereum's token.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said ethereum is facing growing smart-contract competition from other blockchains.

Ether's fair value is around $1,500 based on measures of network activity, a JPMorgan global market strategist has said. That's roughly 55% lower than Friday's price of around $3,470 for ethereum's token.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told Insider that the ethereum network is less attractive than the current price of ether suggests, as it's facing growing competition from blockchains such as solana and cardano.

Panigirtzoglou, who has become JPMorgan's crypto expert, said he and his team have looked at various measures of activity on the ethereum network to try to work out a fair value for the token.

JPMorgan reckons that a larger base of miners and users implies greater adoption and makes the network more attractive for product developers.

""We look at the hashrate and the number of unique addresses to try to understand the value for ethereum. We're struggling to go above $1,500,"" he said.

""There is a question mark here. The current price is expressing an exponential increase in usage and traffic that might not materialise.""

Ether - the cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain - has climbed more than 850% in price against the dollar over the last year during a widespread crypto boom.

Yet Panigirtzoglou told Insider recently that ethereum's key selling point - that developers can build decentralized apps and smart contracts upon it - ""can easily be replicated by other networks.""

""It's not unique,"" he said. ""You're already seeing competition from binance, competition from solana. And there are going to be more in the future."" Panigirtzoglou also cited cardano, which has recently upgraded to allow the creation of smart contracts.

However, Jack O'Holleran, CEO at ethereum development company Skale Labs, told Insider that ethereum is likely to remain the dominant decentralized finance blockchain, especially given upcoming network changes that should help it become larger and faster.

""The vast majority of smart contract developers are building in the ethereum ecosystem,"" O'Holleran said. ""Despite major partnerships being announced on other chains, we still see the absolute majority of (developers) being pulled into the ethereum vortex.""

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, uses crypto technology to create financial products that don't require centralized authorities. For example, they could enable trading without clearing houses or ""smart contracts"" that automatically pay out interest on loans.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/60642f1721887500193e84fc?format=jpeg',)",2 min read,"The cryptocurrency ether runs on the ethereum network.

Speaking to the press earlier this week, the 72-year-old former co-chief investment officer of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said he fears that if Bitcoin gets more popular, global regulators will try to kill the cryptocurrency. The business tycoon also said that despite not being totally onboard with digital currencies in the past, he has converted a portion of his portfolio into Bitcoin.

As per a report by portal CryptoPotato, Dalio feels that countries like India and China are trying to “get rid” of cryptocurrencies. While China has banned trading and transacting in digital currencies, India remains shaky in its approach towards securing the future of cryptos.

“I think at the end of the day if it (Bitcoin) is really successful, they (global regulators) will kill it, and they will try to kill it,” the report quoted Dalio as saying.

The famous investor further highlighted that people must have enough diversification in their portfolios before entering the crypto space given the constant market uncertainty. He has laid emphasis on investors keeping finances safe in the form of gold or other highly valued commodities.

Despite anti-crypto voices like that of Christine Lagarde, the president of European Central Bank questioning the credibility of cryptocurrencies, the digital finance tokens are witnessing fandom among global traders and investors.

The billionaire investor had last month said that Bitcoin was akin to digital gold. A constant evaluation of your investments is the key, according to Dalio. He further suggested avoiding buying an asset like Bitcoin just because of its temporary boom. “Be careful about what you're putting your money in⁠,” he said.

Earlier this month, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin a legal tender alongside the US dollar.

The decision was welcomed by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, who predicted that many more nations will follow the Central American country in adopting Bitcoin, which is the largest cryptocurrency in the world.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/cryptocurrency_mix_stock_pexels_1627728358830.jpg',)",2 min read,"American billionaire Ray Dalio expressed concerns about countries like India and China strangling the growth of world's largest valued cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

Its upcoming digital wallet, Novi, will be built upon the still-pending stablecoin Diem.

Diem is the cryptocurrency that grew out of Facebook’s in-house project that began in 2017 and was first known as Libra. After it was publicly revealed in 2018, the coin received intense scrutiny in Washington, DC, and around the industry.

The cryptocurrency project, rebranded as Diem, now operates as an independent association but retains close ties to Facebook. Facebook executive David Marcus straddles both worlds, sitting on Diem's board of directors and heading up Facebook Financial — which plans to launch Novi in the coming months.

This week, Marcus sat down with Yahoo Finance for a wide-ranging conversation for Influencers with Andy Serwer, a weekly series featuring biggest names in business, politics, entertainment, sports, and academia. Speaking to Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief, Andy Serwer, Marcus made the case for why Facebook still believes Diem is the right platform to build Facebook's new digital wallet around.

“We believe that in terms of consumer protections, both on the purpose built payments blockchain that Diem is and on the stablecoin itself, it’s in a class of its own,” Marcus says.

Diem digital wallet trying to ‘solve the systemic issues’

Marcus says it would have been easier to build the wallet to run on “existing rails.”

""As a matter of fact, a lot of people internally/externally have been puzzled by why we didn't do it that way,"" he added. But using existing rails, he said, “would actually not solve the systemic issues that we believe exists currently in our current payments infrastructure.”

Story continues

Diem coins will be backed by a combination of cash or cash equivalents and short-term government securities, which Marcus says will keep them secure. Ultimately, he said, that is “much better than a current deposit with a traditional wallet here in the U.S.”

Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Marcus also addressed initial concerns over whether Facebook’s coin had enough provisions to stop criminals who have gravitated to cryptocurrencies.

“I actually think and strongly believe that new infrastructure that enables more real time reporting to all of the right authorities at the right time,” Marcus says.

A number of other blockchains have improved their traceability, he acknowledged. But, he added, “I think in our case, we've taken it like really, really to a whole new level.”

A goal of launching Diem cryptocurrency 'before the end of this year'

Whether the industry agrees with Marcus’s outlook is yet to be seen. Libra has struggled to hold on to members with financial giants like Mastercard and Visa leaving the project in 2019.

Back then, Marcus often discussed the association’s goal of 100 members by launch, including in a Yahoo Finance interview at the time. Currently, the association lists 26 members on its site with the regulatory approval process still ongoing.

In a 2019 interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung, Marcus insisted that Libra was ""absolutely not"" in jeopardy. Still, the launch date of the project was pushed back from 2020. Currently, Novi aims to launch before the end of the year along with Diem. Still, Marcus added in his most recent interview with Yahoo Finance, “We are definitely not going to launch without the proper regulatory framework.”

Between July 2020 and June 2021, Africa's cryptocurrency market grew by 1,200 percent – making up for a whopping $105.6 billion (roughly Rs. 775 crores), a recent report by Chainalysis said. Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania all rank among the top 20 countries on the Global Crypto Adoption Index, and together, the African nations represent the third most rapidly growing cryptocurrency market in the world. The report also noted that the bulk of these crypto transactions aren't driven by large institutional investors, but instead small and medium-sized retail buyers and businesses.

As per the report by market research firm Chainalysis, Africa records plenty of smaller transfer sizes indicating higher adoption of cryptocurrency trading at the grassroots level.

“Cross-region transfers also make up a bigger share of Africa's cryptocurrency market than any other region at 96 percent of all transaction volume, versus 78 percent for all regions combined,” the report said.

The study further observed that facilitating crypto payments using peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms is more popular in Africa, as compared to other countries. P2P platforms are online investment gateways that enable borrowers to attract lenders to identify and purchase loans that meet their investment criteria. Using these platforms, Africa-based crypto buyers and investors get into trading in digital currencies.

“Some countries, such as Nigeria and Kenya, have made it difficult for customers to send money to cryptocurrency businesses from their bank accounts, either by passing laws or simply by advising banks not to allow these transfers. However, this isn't an issue for P2P platforms, which are non-custodial and let customers trade cash for cryptocurrency amongst themselves,” Chainalysis explained.

For now, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, and Ukraine are sitting at the top four ranks of rapid crypto adoption. The rate of cryptocurrency adoption rose by 880 percent in 2020 in these regions, a report released earlier this month had claimed.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_disco_reuters_1622203490843.jpg',)",2 min read,"Cryptocurrency adoption in Africa is booming, according to a new report by cryptocurrency analysis firm Chainalysis.

2021-09-18T12:02:03.921498 12:00:24,Gadgets 360,"Post London Upgrade, Ethereum Worth $1 Billion Taken Out Of Circulation",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/ethereum-coins-worth-more-than-1-billion-burnt-after-london-upgrade-2544250,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after Bitcoin, underwent a major upgrade on August 5 this year. Called the London Hard Fork, the latest upgrade was a set of five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). These included EIP 1559, which was aimed at changing the speed and incentivise the mining of the cryptocurrency. EIP 1559 also addressed the criticism Ethereum faced for rising network congestion and transaction costs by introducing a new burning method that simplified the process. Since the upgrade, more than 3 lakh Ethereum coins (Ether) worth over $1 billion (roughly Rs. 7,350 crore) have been burned, or taken out of circulation.

OpenSea, the popular NFT marketplace, accounts for the most burns on the Ethereum network, representing around 43,801 ether coins worth nearly $148 million (roughly Rs. 1,087 crore). It is followed by traditional ether transfers, which stands at 25,999 ether coins worth $88 million (roughly Rs. 646 crore).

According to crypto analytics group Dune Analytics, 3,09,973 coins have been burned so far. Their total worth stands at $1.05 billion (roughly Rs. 7,717 crore), that is lost forever.

The EIP-1559 changed Ethereum's fee rate to a new scheme that makes Ether deflationary. It has been able to reduce the amount of ETH produced daily and increase the amount of burned ether. In the new scheme, one can burn a large amount of transaction fees —called the “base fee” — instead of sending it to miners. According to the EIP 1559 proposal, this was done to counterbalance Ethereum inflation while still giving the block reward and priority fee (the maximum fee users are willing to spend to add their transaction to a block) to miners.

One of the main reasons for the high rate of burned ether is Ethereum's high transaction fees (gas fee). Ethereum handles an estimated 1.2 million transactions on the network daily.

According to CoinMarketCap, ether was trading at $3,517 (roughly Rs. 2.58 lakh) at the time of writing this report.

Ethereum is a decentralised, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality and ether is its native cryptocurrency. It is represented by symbol ETH.

She also noted that crypto transactions consume high amounts of energy, and also said that cyrptocurrencies are not real currencies.

Lately, criticism of cryptocurrencies has heated up from countries like Russia and China. Governments of many countries like China, Russia, Morocco, and Bolivia among others have expressed concerns over the international transfers of these untraceable cryptocurrencies for notorious purposes that could pose danger to national safety.

Investors in Ireland are attracted to digital opportunities offering better returns and often find them online, a new survey has indicated. According to the poll, 11% of investors have already bought a digital asset and a quarter of the young Irish are betting on cryptocurrencies.

Low Interest Rates, Search for Long-Term Returns Push More Irish Investors Toward Alternatives

Investors in the Republic of Ireland are exploring opportunities in the digital space and over half of the participants in a new survey, 56%, say they make investments online. A staggering 80% of the respondents do it to achieve better long-term returns on their money while almost half admit their decisions are influenced by the low interest rates in the traditional banking system.

The poll, the results of which have been quoted by the national broadcaster RTE and the Irish Independent, also shows that more than one in 10 of those questioned have put money into one crypto asset or another. The share of cryptocurrency investors grows to 25% of people aged 25 – 34. This group is the most open to saving in digital coins like bitcoin.

At the same time, stocks and shares have turned out to be the most preferred investment option for 19% of those surveyed. Government or corporate bonds, the Irish media reports reveal, are the second most popular asset among investors in the country.

The majority of 1,000 people who took part in the study, ordered by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), stated they use online resources to find investment-related information (62%). Among these are online banking or investment websites, financial news sites, blogs, and social media platforms. The rest, 38%, prefer to talk to an advisor from a bank or other financial institution.

Online investing options are even more popular among Irish investors under 35. Of this age group, 36% said they would use a trading platform or a mobile app such as Etoro or XTB, while 29% would employ an online financial services provider like Revolut, for example. Only 22% admitted they would invest through a bank or an investment company, and just 10% said they would refer to a broker.

“It is important that consumers are aware that investment products can often be highly complex, so it is essential consumers understand the type of product they are investing in,” said Grainne Griffin, Director of Communications at the CCPC, commenting on the findings in the survey. The commission is urging Irish investors to do their due research before spending any funds.

Griffin also warned that along with the potential for better returns, crypto investments come with higher risks than traditional financial products. Hers is not the first such warning issued in Ireland, with Central Bank Governor Gabriel Makhlouf being among those who have cautioned people that they could lose their money when investing in cryptocurrencies. However, Makhlouf has previously highlighted some of their positives as well, recently praising the “secure, decentralised” crypto technology.

The cryptocurrency trade accelerated after the Supreme Court in March reversed the RBI ban and allowed trading in coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and others. Since then, several online exchanges such as CoinSwitch Kuber and CoinDCX have flourished. But investing in these virtual assets require due diligence, given the extreme volatility of most cryptocurrencies. One way to do that is by looking at historical data of these coins.

How cryptocurrencies have behaved in the past few weeks and months can give an idea of their potential in the near future and whether a person should invest now or wait.

Here's how the top 5 digital coins have behaved so far since the start of this financial year (stating April 1):

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency in the world. Since its launch in 2009, it has remained an undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency market. On April 1 this year, it was trading around Rs. 42 lakhs but by May-end, around the time the market crashed massively because of a Chinese crackdown on mining operations, it hit a low of Rs. 22 lakhs. Bitcoin has, however, recovered. On September 17, it was trading around Rs. 37 lakhs.

Ethereum

Experts say this is the only virtual currency that has any chance of challenging Bitcoin's dominance, but it is far from realising its true potential. At the beginning of this financial year, Ethereum was trading at Rs. 1.40 lakhs. By early August, it breached the Rs. 2-lakh barrier. This was the time when the Ethereum blockchain had the major London upgrade. Since then, it has continued to gain in value. On September 17, at the time of writing, it was trading at Rs. 2.76 lakhs.

Cardano

Launched in 2017, Cardano is a relatively new cryptocurrency coin that has jumped the queue to find its place in the top five. Billed as a third-generation blockchain (Bitcoin and Ethereum being the first and second generations, respectively), Cardano gave returns of almost 150 percent in just one month. On July 20, it was trading at Rs. 79.71 but by August it had reached a high of Rs. 191.41. It registered more gains in the next few weeks, reaching an all-time high of Rs. 227 at the start of this month. But the gains have started to taper off since then. On September 17, at the time of writing, it was trading at Rs. 187.82.

Tether

Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Being the first one, it is the most popular stablecoin. Since it is pegged to the dollar, meaning every Tether coin should be backed by actual dollars in the reserves of Tether Limited, it is highly stable in comparison to other cryptocurrencies. If this stability is predictable, it also curbs the possibility of boosting wealth quickly. It has remained within the Rs. 73–75 range this financial year. It was trading around Rs. 77 on September 17.

Ripple

It's the fifth-placed cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation. Technically speaking, Ripple is not a cryptocurrency.

Popular altcoins including XRP, Cardano, Stellar, Chainlink, Uniswap, Polygon and Litecoin also encountered minor corrections due to weakness in trading volumes.

Commenting on the weakness, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto investment platform, said, “The crypto spectrum witnessed a minor consolidation over the past 24 hours.”

“The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ether, hovered around their local resistance levels of $48,000 and $3500, respectively. After Elon Musk's tweet on 'Floki', the SHIBA INU token rose more than 41 per cent,” he added.

A longer trend for tokens like Bitcoin is still positive although we're still quite far from the highs in May. The recent drops might be linked to things like the fake news that Walmart was going to accept Litecoin — while this was quickly denied by all official sources, in a short period, the damage was done with a sudden price rise and an equally sudden drop.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, on Friday slipped by 0.65 percent in the last 24 hours, but this is still up from earlier this week, according to the Gadgets 360 Bitcoin Price History tracker. Bitcoin price in India was Rs. 37,23,736 at the time of writing this.

Ethereum price in India also dropped 2.84 percent, trading at Rs. 2,77,586. Although Ethereum has faced some challenges of late, it remains the most popular blockchain for use in NFTs which has certainly helped its value.

Dogecoin price in India, on the other hand, is up by 5.25 percent with its value crossing Rs. 20 again. In addition, Tether (USDT) is also up by +0.34 percent and is now trading at Rs. 78.32. As a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar, Tether's price, of course, is not as volatile as other cryptocurrencies.

Meanwhile, Uniswap Price has sunk by 5.21 percent and is trading at Rs. 2,020.76.

The government has also launched a digital wallet, Chivo, which is linked to newly-built cryptocurrency cash machines that allow users to withdraw physical money from their digital Bitcoin holdings. Its roll out has been plagued by glitches.

The Court of Accounts, which can impose administrative and asset sanctions against officials who cannot solve shortcomings, said it received a complaint on September 10 from a regional human rights and transparency organisation, Cristosal, about Bitcoin implementation in El Salvador.

Cristosal requested an audit of the authorisation processes for the purchase of Bitcoins and to review the construction of the booths used for the ATMs linked to the digital wallet of Chivo, a company established with public resources.

Cristosal's complaint was against six members of the Board of Directors of the Bitcóin Trust, consisting of members of the Finance and Economy ministries, as well as the secretariat of Commerce and Investments.

China is ramping up its hunt for illegal cryptocurrency miners, who are trying to disguise their operations as research institutions and data centres, according to a new report.

Authorities in several provinces have conducted more intense inspections of colleges, research labs, data centres and other potential sites that could be hiding crypto mines, Bloomberg reported.

China’s government has framed its ongoing crackdown on crypto as an effort to reduce the country’s carbon emissions. The recent escalation is in part due to authorities’ concerns about power supplies ahead of cold winter weather, according to the report.

Some Chinese crypto mining tycoons have fled the country for Kazakhstan, Canada, the state of Texas and other areas with cheap power and friendlier laws. Other crypto users have been locked up on fraud and money laundering charges.

But crypto miners who remain in China have become increasingly resourceful in evading authorities, according to Bloomberg.

Authorities in several provinces have conducted more intense inspections of colleges, research labs, data centres and other potential sites that could be hiding crypto mines.

One unnamed miner told the outlet that he regularly moves his mining rigs between locations to make his activity harder for authorities to trace.

In a Wednesday statement, authorities in the Chinese province of Hebei urged companies to “strictly prevent the use of system computing power to engage in illegal virtual currency mining.”

“Virtual currency mining consumes huge energy, which runs counter to my country’s goal of ‘carbon neutrality and carbon peak,’” government groups in the province said.

“Its proliferation and spread will seriously affect economic and social development and directly threaten national security.”

China had been responsible for about 46 percent of crypto mining around the globe before the government’s crackdown, which began around May of this year and helped send bitcoin’s price tumbling from its April peak of about $65,000 to less than $33,000 by June.

But bitcoin has somewhat recovered since June, trading higher than $52,000 in early September.

In the list of names, speaking about the bright prospect of Bitcoin, the new entrant is Austrian investor and fund manager Ronald-Peter Stoeferle who said the sentiment for gold is already so negative that it may soar to new all-time highs in the next few months. About cryptocurrency, Stoeferle, managing partner at Incrementum AG, said if Bitcoin is there for the next 5 to 10 years, it may touch a level “we cannot currently imagine”. Stoeferle was asked whether he feels that gold is dead and if cryptocurrency like Bitcoin has played a role in undermining the precious metal? He said the global financial markets have reached a “monetary tipping point”.

The global crypto market cap is $2.17 trillion, a 0.84 per cent decrease over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $110.92 billion, which makes a 10.80 per cent increase.

“Beginning last week, Ethereum formed a distinctive double bottom pattern indicating an upward cycle in the shorter time period. Ethereum, to a greater extent, has managed to recover from a critical level of support, which could potentially see an upswing towards $5,000 levels. The total ETH available on different trading platforms has also seen a considerable dip. This short supply again indicates a definitive price upside.” Siddharth Menon, COO, WazirX said.

Menon, throwing light, said, the Altcoin market is expected to follow the Ethereum trend cycle. Litecoin(LTC), after the recent Walmart debacle, has slowly started to indicate a pattern breakout.

“The past 24 hours witnessed some consolidation across the crypto spectrum. After two consecutive days of rally, the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation consolidated around the resistance levels. Bitcoin fell lower after touching the $48,000 mark, and Ether faced pullback around the $3600 mark. Cardano continued to remain under bearish dominance as it struggled to go past the $2.50 mark. Among the top 30 cryptos by market capitalization, Avalanche and Luna were the showstoppers.

A committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has proposed to subject cryptocurrencies to the “wash sale” rule. Since cryptocurrencies are treated as property by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), they are currently not subject to the wash sale rule. This proposal attempts to close down a big crypto tax loophole.

Crypto Included in New Proposal

The Committee on Ways and Means, the chief tax-writing committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, proposed to subject cryptocurrencies to the wash sale rule Monday. If adopted, the rules will apply to crypto trades occurring after Dec. 31.

The “wash sales” provision in the bill states:

This section includes commodities, currencies, and digital assets in the wash sale rule, an anti-abuse rule previously applicable to stock and other securities. The wash sale rule in section 1091 prevents taxpayers from claiming tax losses while retaining an interest in the loss asset.

The wash-sale rule was designed to discourage people from selling securities at a loss simply to claim a tax benefit. A wash sale occurs when an individual sells a security at a loss and then purchases that same security or substantially identical securities within 30 days.

Shehan Chandrasekera, head of Tax Strategy at crypto tax software firm Cointracker, commented that with this wash sale proposal, the committee “is trying to close down a big crypto tax loophole.” He elaborated:

Since cryptocurrencies are treated as property (IRS 2014-21), they are not subject to the wash sale rule. This allows you to harvest losses more aggressively in crypto than in stocks. You don’t have to wait 30 days. Ways & Means Committee is trying to subject crypto to the wash sale rule.

According to Chandrasekera, “the new rules will not eliminate the tax benefit, it will defer the tax benefit.”

Researcher: ‘We Are Finally in a Multi-Chain Market Structure’

For quite some time now, multi-chain or cross-chain technology has been a holy grail of sorts in the cryptocurrency development space. People want to transact with other blockchains by leveraging bridges to different ecosystems.

Dmitriy Berenzon published a detailed article about the subject of cross-chain tech and bridges, and he believes we’ve finally reached a watershed moment. “After years of research & development, we are finally in a multi-chain market structure,” Berenzon stresses in his blog post.

Berenzon’s study looks at blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, Avalanche, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, Cosmos, and more. The researcher notes that “interoperability unlocks innovation” as he highlights that “bridges are important because they enable users to access new platforms, protocols to interoperate with each other, and developers to collaborate on building new products.”

Moreover, Berenzon lists the many benefits of cross-chain interoperability like leveraging the tech for external validators and federations. Also, using the tech for light clients and relay protocols alongside the ability to access liquidity networks.

However, Berenzon’s report is not just a fluff piece about fintech, and he highlights that cross-chain tech and bridges are an “incredibly difficult problem in distributed systems.” He adds that things like finality and rollbacks need to be addressed, NFT transfers and provenance, alongside stress testing these blockchain bridges over time.

$7.7 Billion Locked Across 8 Bridges to Ethereum

In addition to Berenzon’s insights, statistics from Dune Analytics’ dashboard called “Bridge Away” measure bridge volume tethered to the various chains and Ethereum. In terms of Ethereum bridge relative total value locked (TVL) stats, the Polygon ERC20 Bridge has approximately $2.4 billion in TVL on September 16, 2021.

Polygon’s bridge represents 32.5% of the TVL across eight bridges. The bridges recorded include the Polygon ERC20 Bridge, Arbitrum Bridges, Avalanche Bridge, Solana Wormhole, Fantom Anyswap Bridge, Harmony Bridges, Optimism ERC20 Bridges, and Near Rainbow Bridge.

Across all of these bridges mentioned, there’s $7.79 billion TVL spread across 42,997 unique addresses during the last 30 days. Arbitrum Bridges command 31.5% of the aggregate TVL and the Avalanche Bridge has around 21.2% today.

Solana Wormhole’s TVL is about 6.7% and the Fantom Anyswap Bridge has around 6.6% of the $7.79 billion TVL. Ether and WETH are the top assets held in TVL with $2.9 billion recorded on September 16. USDC is the second leading asset held in bridge TVL with $1.2 billion recorded. This is followed by wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) which has just over a billion dollars held in the overall bridge TVL aggregate total.

What do you think about multi-chain or cross-chain bridge technology and the expanding TVL held by these protocols? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

On August 5, 2021, the Ethereum network and its participants successfully completed the highly anticipated London upgrade, which saw the implementation of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559. Since then, 303,681 ether worth more than a billion U.S. dollars have been burned.

More Than 300K Ether Burned Following EIP-1559

More than a billion dollars worth of ethereum (ETH) has been burned to date, after the London upgrade was implemented 42 days ago. The biggest changes added to the Ethereum blockchain included EIP-1559 and EIP-3554. While EIP-3554 changed the difficulty bomb, EIP-1559 changed Ethereum’s fee rate to a new scheme that makes the crypto asset ether deflationary.

Essentially, fees are standardized and calculated based on network demand, as a transaction pricing mechanism introduces a base fee for every block found on the network. The remainder of the fees will be burned and ether proponents assume this will significantly reduce the overall supply of ethereum. As of today, September 16, 2021, the Ethereum network has burned 303,681 ether worth over $1 billion using Thursday’s ether exchange rates.

Opensea Still Largest Burner, Stablecoin Transfers Add to the Burn Pile

The biggest burners in the network are people transferring ether from one address to another and decentralized applications (dapps) and decentralized finance (defi) platforms as well. The largest ether burner today is the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Opensea as Dune Analytics stats show the market has burned 42,991 ether worth $146.1 million today. Opensea is followed by traditional ether transfers which have added 25,514 ether to the burn pile.

Uniswap V2 and the stablecoin project Tether (USDT) command the third and fourth positions in terms of the top ether burners. To date, the second version of the Uniswap decentralized exchange (dex) has burned 16,665 ether worth $55.8K. Tether’s stablecoin USDT has added 15,015 ether to the burn pile as it is responsible for burning $51 million. Other top burners include Axie Infinity, Uniswap V3, Metamask, the stablecoin project USDC, and Opensea’s registry.

2021-09-17T12:02:14.995234 12:00:24,US News Money,Should You Invest in Solana (SOL)?,https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/should-you-invest-in-solana-sol,"Thanks in large part to low transaction fees, Solana has emerged as one of Ethereum's main competitors. (Getty Images)

Solana may be becoming a victim of its own success. The cryptocurrency had been red hot lately, with backers calling it ""Solana summer"" thanks to the token's scorching gains. On Tuesday, Sept. 14, however, Solana – whose ticker on crypto exchanges is SOL – faced major network instability issues. The organization's Twitter account blamed ""resource exhaustion,"" in part caused by an unusually large number of transactions on the network.

This unexpected activity flooded the network and caused it to malfunction. The failure resembled a distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attack, though it's unclear who, if anyone, was behind the outage. The price of Solana fell as much as 15% that day in response to the negative news.

In the grand scheme of things, however, this is arguably the best sort of problem that an emerging cryptocurrency could face. Too much network activity speaks to Solana's incredible success that it has had in attracting developers, decentralized finance, or DeFi, projects and end users to the platform in just a matter of months. Solana has leveraged that growing user buzz into one of the year's most impressive price charts. Even with the recent sell-off, SOL is up approximately 1,000% over the past six months.

Recent network outages notwithstanding, why has Solana generated so much buzz in the crypto community and become one of the top 10 tokens by market capitalization? And should you invest in Solana?

How Ethereum and Solana Are Disrupting Finance

For a long time, Bitcoin was the undisputed champion of the cryptocurrency arena. Over the past year, however, the value of Ethereum has appreciated sharply compared to Bitcoin. This is, in large part, because of a highly active developer community and an ever-increasing number of applications built on Ethereum. Ethereum has led the way in offering smart contracts, DeFi, nonfungible tokens, known as NFTs, and more.

Bitcoin retains a large loyal fan base due to its first-mover advantage and powerful brand. However, as far as actual usefulness in financial transactions goes, Ethereum has become the dominant force lately.

Here's where Solana enters the picture. Solana has become one of the main rivals to Ethereum. Others have certainly tried. Cardano, for example, may theoretically solve many of the issues with resource usage and high transaction fees that currently limit Ethereum. But Cardano has rolled out smart contracts and other advanced features at a slow pace.

Solana, by contrast, has had no issues converting its technological promise into tangible results. Blake Richman, senior portfolio manager at Sarson Funds, highlighted the activity on Solana. ""There's nearly 400 dApps (decentralized applications) on Solana now; similar to what you would find on Ethereum, including DeFi, NFTs and gaming. There's now nearly $12 billion locked in DeFi applications on Solana, growing from $2 billion in 30 days,"" Richman says.

Solana has made particular inroads with NFTs. Its Degenerate Ape collection of art, for example, has been a huge hit. Some Degenerate Ape NFTs have sold for more than $1 million each. And that's far from the only social activity gaining popularity on Solana. ""It feels like there is a new NFT minting event on Solana every day, and there are a few hotly anticipated blockchain-based games being released on Solana, such as Star Atlas,"" Richman says.

A big reason why Solana is exploding in popularity is due to its rock-bottom transaction fees. Ben Weiss, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin ATM operator CoinFlip, noted that the average transaction cost on Solana is only $0.00025. That's orders of magnitude cheaper than Ethereum and other leading cryptocurrencies. ""The ability to transact so quickly and cheaply sets Solana apart from the pack in many ways,"" Weiss says.

This has become a pivotal issue this year as so-called ""gas"" fees to use the Ethereum network have exploded. While Ethereum still works well enough for bigger smart contracts or NFT purchases, it has put a damper on many types of commerce.

For applications such as gaming and micropayments, Ethereum's current fee structure won't cut it. The Ethereum community has a roadmap in place to try to relieve this obstacle. For now, though, there's a big opportunity to take market share from Ethereum. Solana is making the most of the opportunity, and that's a major reason the SOL coin price has been rallying.

SOL: More Than Just Low Fees

Solana has some other things going for it as well. While its developer community is still much smaller than Ethereum's, Solana's easy-to-use Rust programming language could help drive further community adoption. The combination of low fees and a quicker learning curve could be the winning combination. ""As blockchains currently stand, Solana is the most efficient by the majority of metrics,"" Weiss says.

That upbeat take isn't an isolated view. Josh Goodbody is the chief operating officer of Qredo and previously served as Europe, Middle East and Africa director at Binance. Goodbody also sees SOL as a strong competitor to Ethereum. ""Solana's hallmarks are speed of transactions and low gas fees, due to an innovative proof-of-history protocol. Thanks to this powerful infrastructure, they have raised over $300 million this year from the likes of a16z and Polychain,"" Goodbody says.

Goodbody presciently warned that Solana would need to decentralize further and obtain more network validators. This weakness came to light recently in the wake of Solana's widespread network problems. Despite that, with its strong backers and fast transaction network, Solana has a good shot at bouncing back.

Not everyone is so enamored with Solana, however. Andrew Keys, co-founder and managing partner at Darma Capital, sees Ethereum retaining its market-leading position.

""The work that Solana has done and the technology they have developed is cool, but they have made important trade-offs to do it, offering a more centralized solution akin to a traditional server. Solana will work well for a number of use cases, but ultimately, the base layer for the majority of DeFi and Web3 will be Ethereum amplified by layer 2 (scaling solutions),"" Keys says.

While investors should heed that cautionary note, there's still a lot to like about SOL. ""The future for Solana is exciting, as its speed and low fees provide a better user experience. Further, Solana may ultimately be a better environment for certain financial applications that require high rates of transactions or data transference,"" Richman says.

Solana is recovering from a large and embarrassing technical problem with its network. If its engineers can't improve network stability, the value proposition for the SOL coin could be impaired. Still, this seems like the sort of growing pain that a rapidly expanding network would face.","('https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/086f5e2/2147483647/crop/2000x1334%2B0%2B2/resize/970x647/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Ff7%2F3e%2F4a9331b3481eae803cc754586955%2Finvestingphone.jpg',)",5 min read,"Thanks in large part to low transaction fees, Solana has emerged as one of Ethereum's main competitors.

NEW DELHI: The world of cryptocurrencies is very dynamic. Research paper ‘Distrust or Speculation? The socioeconomic drivers of US cryptocurrency investments’, published in July 2021 reveals many useful findings about the sociodemographics of cryptocurrency usage in the US.The research conducted by Raphael Auer of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and David-Tercero Lucas of the Autonomous University underscored following important conclusions in the American context:* The research found that men have a higher propensity to invest in cryptocurrency than women. A gender gap was seen in terms of cryptocurrency ownership.* Levels of education and income, digital financial experience gained from using debit and credit cards, using a mobile app to pay for products also played an important role in orienting the choice of cryptocurrency.- Owners of XRP and ether are the most educated ones, followed by Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin users.- Owners of XRP, Ether and Stellar are the highest earners while Bitcoin investors earn the least.- Litecoin owners are the least educated.* Gender and age were found to be unrelated to differences in knowledge about crypto technology.* Owning a cryptocurrency in one year increases the probability of owning a cryptocurrency in the next year by 50 percent on the basis of an empirical test hodling, which is a misspelling of the word holding means buying and holding cryptocurrency for a longer period.* Cryptocurrencies are not treated as alternatives to fiat currency but rather as a niche digital speculation object.The research done by Auer and Tercero used the Federal Reserve’s survey data as base. The pool of investors in cryptocurrencies in the US has increased dramatically by 2020 with nearly 4 per cent Americans having cryptos in their portfolio than 1.4 per cent in 2019 as per Federal Reserve survey.Charles Randell, the chair of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, had warned that the hype and frenzy surrounding digital currencies could lure customers into such fraudulent investments and thus the need for regulation. The crux of the research by the Auer-Tercero duo is also to have cryptocurrency regulations since the objectives of investors in cryptocurrency are the same as those for the asset classes.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-86270887,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108252,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",2 min read,"Cryptocurrency Live Previous Next(For the latest crypto news, investment tips and real-time price updates, follow our.)

“He really convinced me this was something I needed to do,” Cohen, the founder of Point72 Asset Management and owner of the New York Mets, said on Tuesday at the Sky­bridge Alternatives Conference, according to a person with knowledge of his remarks. That was part of a journey that included meeting with as many people over the past six months as he could to educate himself.

“Once I decided there were opportunities, and I thought this could be a space like the internet — it could be incredibly transformational — I wasn’t go­ing to miss this,” Cohen said in a discussion titled “Genera­t­ing Alpha in Markets and Base­ball” moderated by Sky­bridge Cap­i­t­­al founder Anthony Scaramucci.

Cohen, 65, who has a net worth of $11.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has since thrown himself into the world of crypto in a personal capacity and at his firm.

This week, he announced he was investing in Radkl, a quantitative trading firm for digital assets. That was after Recur, a non-fungible token company, said Cohen’s family office also invested in its latest funding round. Cohen, meanwhile, told Scaramucci that Point72 is building crypto-trading capabilities at the firm.

His interest in the virtual realm extends beyond crypto: Cohen expressed a fascination with the metaverse, or a vision of a virtual world where people interact through avatars.

“There’s some far-out ideas out there, about how people are going to spend their time,” he said. “Your mind can run wild,” he added, about how people will interact in the metaverse, potentially buying virtual real estate and virtual outfits for their avatars.

Cohen, a Mets fan who bou­ght the team in December for about $2.5 billion, also add­ressed the club’s performance and why he loves owning it.

“It’s taken me into a different realm,” Cohen said. “Own­ing a hedge fund, you have some notoriety, but it’s nothing like owning a sports team in New York.” He weighed in on the world of social media, where he has been more vocal since acquiring the Mets, saying it has helped people to see him as a human being, and not just a wealthy hedge fund owner.","('https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2018-04/18/full/1524071449-7465.jpg',)",2 min read,"Hedge fund billionaire was until recently a bit of a skeptic when it came to Then his son, a “cryptomaniac”, helped change his mind.

Crypto has soared in the first half of the current financial year. The value of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin shot up.

Major corporations including Apple, Google, Tesla, Samsung, Facebook and PayPal have devised strategies tuned to crypto. Pioneers in the technology count themselves among millionaires now.

After initial skepticism, India is slowly changing its stand towards crypto. Legislation is on the anvil to classify crypto as an asset like a commodity. There are a few things you have to be aware of before investing in crypto.

Research first

Any monetary decision should be preceded by detailed research and homework. Conduct a detailed study about all the cryptos out there in the market. First you have learn what blockchain technology is. Blockchain is the foundational tech of crypto.

Steer clear of schemes

Crypto is decentralised. There is no regulatory mechanism available as with central bank-issued currencies. You have to do your homework about the source of the currency, the nature of the issuer and their authenticity. Do not fall into traps and fraudulent schemes. Be wary of fraudsters who promise impossible returns.

Start small

The value of crypto is volatile. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Test the waters by investing a small amount. You can start small trading too. Start with a single currency and follow its trends. That will give you a deeper insight into how cryptos work. Once you are confident of the sector, you can diversify your investment.

Devise your own strategy

There are fraudsters and imposters in all fields. Crypto is no exception. There are people who collect money from gullible investors and supply them with wallets with non-existing currencies. Once they get the money, they would be untraceable. Do not take all advice at face value. Learn on your own. Learn about all the currencies in the market. Consider the opinions of experts in the field. Do not imbibe whatever you see on social media. You have to form an investment strategy that suits you best.

Maintain equilibrium

Crypto investment demands patience. This is a highly volatile market. There may be a spike in prices. There may be a slide in prices. Face these swings with equanimity. Analyse the market calmly and logically.

Be safe

Cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets. There are online wallets and offline wallets. New investors are recommended to keep an online wallet. Get a strong password to keep you safe from hacking and online theft. It is a good idea to create an exclusive email id for crypto transactions alone.

Know your taxes

Before you invest in crypto, you have to have a deep understanding about local tax laws in the country where your assets are based in. Most of the countries tax crypto heavily.","('https://img.onmanorama.com/content/dam/mm/en/news/business/images/2021/9/16/cryptocurrency-bitcoin.jpg',)",2 min read,"You have to do your homework about the source of the currency, the nature of the issuer and their authenticity.

Indian investors are waiting in anticipation for the official verdict on cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Even though El Salvador has embraced the digital revolution in currency, India is still mulling over the issue. Last week, Jayant Singh, Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, said in an online event that the Indian government would take a “distinctive approach” to regulate cryptocurrencies in India. The statement came at a time when cryptocurrency is still unregulated in the country. India has a strong base of cryptocurrency investors and exchanges. But investors are still in the dark about the future of cryptocurrency.

Is Cryptocurrency Illegal In India?

Currently, bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are beyond the purview of legal regulation in India. We cannot call them illegal because they are not yet authorised for use by any central authority in the country. Cryptocurrency remains outside the scope of any guidelines, regulations, or rules. This makes Bitcoin and altcoin transactions riskier because disputes arising from these exchanges will not be legally bound.

Cryptocurrency Taxes

Though India hasn't yet imposed regulations on cryptocurrency transactions, it has asked for transparency in all such undertakings. In April, amendments were introduced in the Companies Act for this purpose. Owing to this transparency, digital asset and the gains thereof are likely to be counted as a capital asset, which is bound by taxes under capital gains. But companies are not yet sure how to treat the different types of gains and income in this regard.

Cryptocurrency Bill

The Cryptocurrency Bill is speculated to be tabled during the Parliament's winter session this year. Its aim is to define and classify cryptocurrency according to the technology involved. An inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency recently suggested that cryptocurrencies be treated as digital assets and not currency. There are also speculations that government-enforced crypto coins may become the norm.

What If India Bans Cryptocurrency?

A ban on cryptocurrency in India would mean you won't be able to convert local fiat currency to buy cryptocurrency or liquidate HODL-ed cryptocurrencies into cash. Crypto exchanges will also stop. The ban would ensure that the HODL-ed cryptocurrency stays on HODL until the restriction is lifted.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/2r1h0gng_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",2 min read,"Even though El Salvador has embraced the digital revolution in currency, India is still mulling over the issue.

Bitcoin’s spectacular fall from grace has also dragged its rivals into the red zone in another blow to cryptocurrency.

Last week, an estimated $US400 billion ($A543 billion) vanished from the crypto market after bitcoin crashed by more than 10 per cent in a single day.

The volatile cryptocurrency dropped from $US50,257 ($A68,211) to $US43,351 ($A58,838).

It’s stayed below the critical $US50,000 ($A68,000) mark ever since.

At time of writing, bitcoin had gained a bit, trading at $US45,055.31 ($A61,151.32).

The massive price drop came as El Salvador became the first country to introduce bitcoin as legal tender.

Although the country’s radical move at first buoyed the market, it soon sent bitcoin plummeting after the country had to pause digital wallets because of a glitch.

Like dominoes, other cryptocurrency started to topple.

Ethereum, cardano and binance recorded even sharper falls than their bitcoin counterparts.

The three digital coins plunged between 13 per cent and 18 per cent last week.

At time of writing, etheruem was trading at $US3288.95 ($A4463.93), down from its all-time high of $US4196.63 ($A5695.88) in May, according to cryptocurrency aggregator CoinMarketCap.

A single Cardano coin can now be bought for $US2.42 ($A3.28) down from its highest ever price of $US2.58 ($A3.50) late last month.

As for binance, the coin is now worth $US399.46 ($A542.17) despite its all-time high in May of $690.90 ($A937.72).

In all, $400 billion ($A543 billion) was wiped off the charts, and the world’s cryptocurrencies hit this year’s rock bottom of a market cap $1.9 trillion ($A2.58 trillion) on Tuesday, according to Forbes.

However, despite the shaky start to El Salvador’s bid as a crypto nation, the country’s leader decided to make the most of the coin crashes.

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced the country took advantage of the “dip” by buying up an additional 150 bitcoins.

Mr Bukele’s holdings have now gone up to 550 coins – worth a total of about $US25 million ($A34 million).

First country to make bitcoin legal tender

In June, El Salvador voted to become the first nation in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.

With 62 out of 84 possible votes, politicians voted in favour of the move to create a law to adopt bitcoin for everyday use.

The bill allows the famously volatile digital currency to be used for many aspects of daily life, from property purchases to tax contributions.

The law came into effect last Tuesday, on September 7.

To encourage citizens to jump on the bandwagon, the El Salvador government even handed out $30 in free bitcoins to anyone who signed up for its national digital wallet, known as Chivo.

Foreigners who invest three bitcoins into the country – currently a whopping $US150,000 ($A200,000) – will be granted residency, according to Fast Company.

Bitcoin investors can also avoid paying tax, according to The Coin Telegraph.

However, not everyone is a fan of the move.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is worried about the coin’s volatility and has warned that it could destabilise the El Salvador economy.

New Delhi: The government is looking at ways to tax cryptocurrency trades and the entire system around it, a senior official told ET Now. The development comes in as the cabinet will soon take up the draft bill on cryptocurrencies.

ET Now learns the government may permit the usage of blockchain technology and may treat cryptos as a tradable asset class without banning it.

FM Sitharaman in the past also made her stance on cryptocurrency clear, saying that the government was not looking to shut all options and that people will be given adequate windows to experiment with blockchain, bitcoins and cryptocurrency.

""Taxation of cryptocurrency would not lend any official recognition to it,"" the official who did not wish to be named said. ""We are approaching cryptocurrency with the principle that any activity that generates income must pay tax,"" the official added.

Meanwhile, former RBI Deputy Governor R Gandhi made a case for the taxation of crypto transactions based on payment channels.

“Cryptocurrencies should be paid for through normal payment channels. If they are not, then it should be deemed as mined and capital gains tax must be levied. That is like voluntary disclosure. The transactions should be fully tracked through a repository,” Gandhi said last week.","('https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/bitcoin_bccl_5.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top',)",1 min read,"Representational Image | Photo Credit: BCCLNew Delhi: The government is looking at ways to tax cryptocurrency trades and the entire system around it, a senior official told ET Now.

In the early days, there were only a few web portals with cryptocurrency statistics and data tied to these ever-changing digital asset markets and blockchain metrics. More than ten years later, however, data and analytics tethered to the world’s most popular and most used digital currencies have swelled with growth. The following article delves into a myriad of web portals that offer insights into the innovative land of cryptocurrencies.

Charts, Onchain Metrics, and Coin Market Cap Aggregation

Over a decade ago, there were a couple of websites that shared information concerning bitcoin (BTC) and the small number of digital assets that traded beside BTC in the early days. A few websites displayed BTC’s price and a handful of onchain statistics, so people could get a sense of crypto markets and the utility of these blockchains. Web portals in the early days consisted of price chart pages like zeroblock.com, onchain metrics from blockchain.info (now blockchain.com), and crypto coin market aggregators like coinmarketcap.com.

Now with more than 10,000 crypto assets worth around $2.21 trillion on September 12, 2021, there’s a plethora of data and analytical websites that help guide crypto supporters with various forms of insight. Coinmarketcap.com has a number of competitors now such as coingecko.com, coincap.io, markets.bitcoin.com, and messari.io. All of them are very different and they each give a contrasting perspective on crypto coin market cap aggregation, alongside insights into different kinds of market data. Coingecko.com and messari.io, for instance, show metrics like percentages for crypto coins over 24 hours, one week, two weeks, 30 days, 90 days, and year-to-date.

Markets.bitcoin.com offers a unique perspective of coin market caps and individual insights to different coins with professional tradingview.com charts. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency market aggregator from Bitcoin.com also shows token summaries stemming from intotheblock.com. The portal coincap.io is similar to markets.bitcoin.com and coingecko.com, as it shows an aggregated list of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Coincap.io is also interesting because visitors can swap tokens by connecting a decentralized finance (defi) wallet like Metamask, Portis, Torus, and the Coinbase Wallet.

Track, Compare, Access Important Ecosystem Platforms

Another website that helps users explore cryptocurrency markets is coinread.com, which offers insight into 1,752 cryptocurrencies and metrics from more than 100 crypto exchanges. Coinread.com provides a few distinct methods to look at key metrics like rank, volume, circulating supplies, and the top exchanges where these digital currencies are traded the most. Users can compare different crypto assets to view price movements in a chart showing a myriad of choices.

Further, coinread.com users can track different coins and follow the market changes tied to the user’s portfolio. Individual crypto assets are broken down into different time intervals, like one hour, 24 hours, seven-day, one month, and annual changes. Users can view an individual crypto asset to get a description of the token, alongside important information like the project’s website, white paper, source code, blockchain explorers, social media links, and forums.

All of these web portals offer different perspectives when it comes to the vast land of crypto assets and there are many more helpful websites to keep you informed. Defillama.com, for instance, is a defi dashboard that shows the aggregate total value locked in defi applications across multiple blockchains. Users can get further insights on crypto derivatives markets like options, futures, and perpetual swaps from the web portals skew.com and bit.com as well.

Dune Analytics offers insights to onchain Ethereum data, ether-based products and market statistics tied to things like defi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized exchange (dex) platforms. Dappradar.com also shows a plethora of factoids and market stats tethered to defi, NFTs, and NFT markets.

The aforementioned list of web portals that inform crypto investors barely scratches the surface when it comes to data sites and analytical products. The best part, however, is that all of these crypto applications are free to use even though some of the sites offer more tracking depth for paid subscribers.

Along with this, crypto investors are also watching the formation of a golden cross in Bitcoin. If this bullish setup completes, it will signal a trend in favor of the bulls. For the time being, investors continue to focus on select altcoins that have continued their northward journey.

On the fundamental front, Bitcoin reached another milestone as miners produced the 700,000th block on Sept. 11. Bitcoin was trading near $8,000 when the 600,000th block was reached on Oct. 18, 2019.

Reaching this milestone led some Twitter users to quote Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin’s earliest pioneers who said:

""Every day that goes by and Bitcoin hasn't collapsed due to legal or technical problems, that brings new information to the market. It increases the chance of Bitcoin's eventual success and justifies a higher price.""

Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may attract trader’s attention in the short term.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin closed below the 200-day SMA ($45,894) on Sept. 10 but bears have not been able to capitalize on this move. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back above the 200-day SMA.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The moving averages are close to completing a golden cross, indicating that the advantage is likely to tilt in favor of the bulls. If buyers push the price above $47,399.97, the BTC/USDT pair will attempt to rise to the overhead zone of $50,500 to $52,920.

The bears are likely to defend the overhead zone aggressively but if bulls do not give up much ground, the likelihood of a break above $52,920 increases. If that happens, the pair could rally to $60,000.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that bears are aggressively defending the 200-day SMA. The pair could then retest the critical support at $42,451.67. A break below this level could tilt the advantage in favor of bears.

BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the price turned down from $47,550 on two occasions. Hence, this becomes an important level to watch out for in the short term. A break and close above this resistance may open the doors for a possible move to $50,500.

However, the moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, indicating that sellers are attempting to make a comeback. A break and close below $44,000 could signal a minor advantage to bears. The pair could then drop to the critical level at $42,451.67.

ALGO/USDT

The long tail on Sept. 7 shows that bulls aggressively bought the dip to the 50-day SMA ($1.10). Strong buying on Sept. 8 propelled Algorand (ALGO) above the stiff overhead resistance at $1.84.

ALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears tried to trap the bulls by sinking the price below the breakout level at $1.84 on Sept. 10 but the buyers had other plans. The ALGO/USDT pair has rebounded off the support with strength on Sept. 12 and bulls are currently attempting to thrust the price above $2.49.

If they succeed, the pair could resume the uptrend with the first target on the upside at $3 and then $3.32. On the contrary, if the price once again turns down from $2.49, the pair could drop to $1.84 and stay range-bound between these two levels for the next few days.

A break and close below $1.84 will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap. The pair could then slide to $1.60.

ALGO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that bears are defending the overhead resistance at $2.49. If sellers pull the price below $2.30, the pair could again slide to the breakout level at $1.84. A bounce off this support could suggest a range-bound action for some time.

If bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will increase the possibility of a break above $2.49. If buyers sustain the breakout, it could signal the resumption of the uptrend.

ATOM/USDT

Cosmos (ATOM) bounced off the breakout level at $17.56 on Sept. 7, suggesting that bulls are aggressively defending this support. This was the second instance that bulls successfully held this level; the first was on Aug. 26–27.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The long tail on Sept. 8 showed that sentiment was turning positive and traders were buying on dips. The moving averages have completed a golden cross, indicating that bulls are back in the driver’s seat.

Strong buying today has pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $32.32. If bulls sustain the breakout, the ATOM/USDT pair may rally to $39.43.

The bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below $32.32 and trap the aggressive bulls. If they succeed, the pair may drop to $26. A break below this level will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened.

ATOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that bears sold the breakout above $32.32 but they could not sustain the pair below $32. This suggests that bulls continue to buy on every minor dip. If bulls sustain the price above $32.32, the pair could rally to $38.49.

Conversely, if bears again pull the price below $32.32, the pair could drop to $30.98. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will attempt to resume the uptrend but if the support cracks, the decline could extend to the critical support at $26.

XTZ/USDT

Tezos (XTZ) completed a successful retest of the breakout level at $4.47 on Sept. 7 and Sept. 8. Although bears pulled the price below the 200-day SMA ($4.19), they could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests accumulation on dips.

The XTZ/USDT pair picked up momentum on Sept. 9 and bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $6.14 on Sept. 10. The long wick on the candlestick of the past two days indicates strong selling near $7.

Hence, this becomes an important resistance for the bulls to cross. If they manage to do that, the pair could retest the all-time high at $8.42. A breakout and close above this level will suggest the start of a new uptrend.

Alternatively, if the price once again turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair could drop to $5. Such a move will suggest aggressive profit-booking at higher levels.

The four-hour chart shows the pair is currently consolidating between $5.88 and $6.80. If bulls drive and sustain the price above the overhead resistance zone at $6.80 to $6.95, the pair may rally to $7.72.

If the price turns down from $6.80, the pair may extend its range-bound action for some more time. A break and close below $5.88 will be the first sign that bulls are losing their grip. The pair could then drop to the 50-SMA.

EGLD/USD

Elrond (EGLD) rebounded off the 200-day SMA ($131) on Sept. 7 and Sept. 8, suggesting strong demand at lower levels. The moving averages completed a golden cross on Sept. 9, indicating that bulls are back in command.

Sustained buying propelled the EGLD/USDT pair to a new all-time high on Sept. 11 where bears tried to stall the up-move. However, the bulls were in no mood to let go of their advantage and have pushed the price to a new all-time high today.

If bulls sustain the price above $245.80, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend. The bears may pose a stiff challenge at the psychological level at $300, but if bulls can overcome this resistance, the rally may extend to $357.80.

The bears will have to pull and sustain the price below the breakout level at $245.80 to signal a possible change in trend.

The bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the ascending channel pattern. If they manage to do that, the bullish momentum could pick up further and the pair may enter a blow-off phase.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level, the pair may drop to the support line of the channel. A strong rebound off it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips.

A break and close below the channel will be the first sign that the bullish momentum could be weakening.

Washington policymakers are alarmed at the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market which exceeded a record $2 trillion in April. As of Friday, the market cap of stablecoins stood at roughly $125 billion, according to industry data site CoinMarketCap. It is unclear which financial regulations apply to these relatively new products.

U.S. financial regulators are working to understand the risks and opportunities posed by cryptocurrencies to the traditional US financial system and plan to issue a number of reports on the subject in coming months, they have said.

In July, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

In a sign those efforts are gathering pace, Treasury officials this week met with financial industry executives to discuss potential stablecoin regulation, the three sources said.

Two of the people said that in meetings this week, one of which took place on Friday, officials asked whether stablecoins would require direct oversight if they become extremely popular. They also discussed how regulators should try to mitigate the risks of too many people trying to cash in their stablecoins at the same time, and whether major stablecoins should be backed by traditional assets.

Officials also asked about how stablecoins should be structured, how they could be used, whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient, and other safety and soundness issues, one of the people said.

Treasury officials also met earlier in the week with a group of banks and credit unions to discuss similar issues, another of the people said. Treasury officials appeared to be gathering information and did not share their thinking on how stablecoins should be regulated, this person added.

The information gathered at this week's meetings is likely to help shape a broad Treasury report on stablecoins expected in the coming months.

In a statement, Treasury spokesman John Rizzo said the department is examining ""potential benefits and risks of stablecoins for users, markets, or the financial system.""

""As this work continues, the Treasury Department is meeting with a broad range of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, members of Congress and market participants,” he added.

Washington policymakers worry the rise in privately-operated currencies could undermine their control of the financial and monetary systems, increase systemic risks, promote financial crime, and hurt investors.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also working on cryptocurrency projects, they have said.

As of September 11 (10:19am IST), Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.16 lakhs.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/lpm28078_crypto-bloomberg_625x300_16_August_21.jpg',)",2 min read,"As of Friday, the market cap of stablecoins stood at roughly $125 billion, according to industry data site CoinMarketCap.

In the domain of cryptocurrencies, the term “crypto” denotes the complicated cryptography that permits the creation and processing of digital currencies, and also their transactions through decentralized networks. Although this essential aspect of the sector has come under assault as it has grown in popularity, cryptocurrencies are nearly always meant to be impervious to government exploitation and regulation. In this post, you will learn about the top 10 cryptocurrencies which are worth it for long-term investments.

Best Cryptocurrencies for Long-term Investment

Bitcoin- BTC

Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency that was established in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an unknown individual or group of individuals. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital money that may be transmitted directly from one user to another on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. Cryptography is used by network nodes to validate transactions, which are subsequently recorded in a blockchain, a public distributed ledger.

Regardless of whether its price increases or decreases, bitcoin will remain dominant in the cryptocurrency market. Strong liquidity will benefit traders as long as it persists, regardless of market volatility.

Ethereum- ETH

Ethereum is a decentralised digital platform that enables the creation and execution of Smart Contracts and DApps without any need for third-party downtime, fraud, control, or interference. Ethereum is a permissionless, non-hierarchical collection of servers (nodes) that produce and reach consensus on an ever-growing network of “blocks,” or bunches of transactions, known as the blockchain.

Tether- USDT

Tether, formerly known as Realcoin, was among the first cryptocurrencies to be linked to the US dollar when it was established in 2014. Tether is a cryptocurrency whose crypto tokens are insured by an equal number of traditional fiat currencies kept in a separate bank account, such as the dollar, pound, or Japanese yen. Tether is a stablecoin, a form of cryptocurrency that aims to keep cryptocurrency prices consistent, as opposed to the large price swings seen in other prominent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Ripple- XRP

Ripple was originally introduced in 2012 as a cryptocurrency and a digital payment system for financial transactions. XRP was established by Ripple Labs as a payment currency for their decentralized payment system. Because the firm originated with a blockchain-based system, XRP is utilised with a network of verification nodes instead of a blockchain. Ripple XRP has a market value of $26,8 B as of April 2nd, and oneXRP is currently trading for $0.5926.

Uniswap- UNI

The Uniswap protocol is a decentralized crypto exchange mechanism. Uniswap is the name of the business that invented the protocol. The protocol enables for automatic transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain by the use of smart contracts. It has a market value of $15.2 B as of April 2nd, and one UNI is worth $29.21.

Dogecoin- DOGE

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was created as a joke by software developers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer to mock the booming cryptocurrency market at the time. On May 9, 2021, SpaceX launched the first cryptocurrency-funded space mission, a Dogecoin-funded ridesharing flight to the Moon.

Cardano- ADA

Cardano is a cryptocurrency system and open-sourced project aiming to build an open public blockchain for payment systems. Cardano’s internal coin is called Ada.

Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum’s five original founders, was a co-founder of the company. He departed Ethereum after significant disputes with its direction, subsequently assisting in the creation of Cardano.

Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot is a one-of-a-kind cryptocurrency that aims to make blockchain interoperability accessible to the general public. Its protocol connects permissioned and permissionless blockchains, and also oracles, enabling systems to communicate in a single environment. Gavin Wood is a co-founder and former CEO of the Ethereum Project. As of March 2021, Polkadot is valued at $30.3 billion, and one DOT is worth $32.83. Polkadot is a decentralized internet that allows different blockchains to share data and information in a trustless manner via the Polkadot relay chain.

Binance Coin: BNB

BNB is an ERC20 token based on Ethereum that was developed by Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange. This currency can be used to pay a commission for purchases on the exchange. A total of 200 million tokens were manufactured for the currency. As per the Whitepaper, Binance plans to use 20% of earnings each quarter to purchase back and burn BNB until 50% of the total BNB supply (100 M) has been burned.

Bitcoin Cash- BCH

BCH is a cryptocurrency that was created in 2017 as a fork of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash was created with the intention of having a bigger block size than Bitcoin, enabling for more transactions to be recorded in a single block. Aside from their differences, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin have certain technological similarities, such as the usage of the same consensus process and a 21 million coin supply cap. As of April 2, it has a market capitalization of $10.8 billion, and 1 Bitcoin Cash is worth $575.17.

Conclusion

Cryptocurrency is no longer considered a speculative investment. Digital assets are being taken seriously by both retail and institutional investors. With so much buzz surrounding the digital currency, investors are seeing it as a viable option for both short-term profit and long-term investment. The rise of cryptocurrencies necessitates extreme care while investing in them. Before investing in crypto, investors must properly assess its potential.

Bitcoin's recent surge has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm. It breached the $50,000 mark again a few days ago and has continued to stay over the psychological level since. Bitcoin, the world's largest and oldest cryptocurrency, has left analysts wondering whether or not it will be able to keep its price intact. There are also speculations over a surge in the prices of altcoins. Altcoins, or Bitcoin alternative cryptocurrencies, are showing a stellar performance on the charts, with some long-time competitors like Ethereum still competing for a growing market cap.

Given that altcoins and NFTs saw hype among investors over July and August, the cryptocurrency scene could witness unexpected surges on these fronts.

Here are some altcoins, whose prices may rise in days to come:

Ethereum (ETH): At the time of writing, Ethereum's price hovered around $3,732.40. Over the last week, Ethereum or ether rose in value by 12.34 per cent. It has seen steady growth over the months, making the speculations stronger.

Cardano (ADA): Cardano is the other big name that may see a surge in price in the future. It ranks third, with a market cap of $84 billion. The coin witnessed a stark rise this May when Tesla stopped taking payments in Bitcoin due to the large electricity expenditure over its mining. ADA reached new heights as investors found an environmentally sustainable alternative in it. An update this month will bring smart contracts to its blockchain and more investors may get interested in it. A price rise won't be surprising.

Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink ranks 12 on the charts. But its popularity among investors and on social media is grabbing eyeballs. Over the last 7 days, it has seen a rise by almost 23 per cent in value. Its value rests at around $32 per token currently. Sites like Coin Quora and others suggest a bullish target for LINK and expect it to cross the $50 mark within a year.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The meme currency was made popular by the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. It rose to prominence in the past few months. Now, it's one of the cryptocurrencies that is considered to be a viable investment option. In 2021, the cryptocurrency returned more than 8,000 per cent.

Avalanche (AVAX): Alongside Cardano and Dogecoin, this altcoin has received a lot of attention in 2021. It has a maximum supply of 720 million. In August 2021, its value tripled. In fact, since its inception in September 2020, the coin has returned a whopping 2,440 per cent.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-04/q7d8b2k8_bitcoin_625x300_06_April_21.jpg',)",2 min read,"The altcoin craze among investors may result in a surge in the values of these digital assetsBitcoin's recent surge has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm.

This concern was conveyed to the government of India. However, Das said that the final call on the issue falls to the government and that they have to decide what to do on the matter, according to the report. Das added that the RBI would like to have credible explanations and answers as to the value that such instruments (cryptocurrencies) can get the Indian economy.

It should be noted that cryptocurrencies are under the regulatory gaze and have been for some time now, with the government still on the fence as to whether to allow them fully or not. This is despite their obvious lack of regulation, highly complex mining processes and price volatility that make it such an unstable financial instrument. At the moment calls have been made to treat cryptocurrencies as a foreign asset according to the report.

One of the first countries to recognise Bitcoin as an official asset was El Salvador. The South American nation recognised the digital asset earlier this week on September 7, 2021. The country decided to adopt crypto as a legal tender. In the wake of this, the country has also been witnessing waves of civil unrest following the value correction of the currency by 20 per cent in a single day, reports mentioned.

Speaking at the event, Das said, “We have conveyed our serious and major concerns about cryptocurrencies to the government from a point of view of financial stability. The government will take a decision.”

“I think we need more credible answers as to whether going forward, the whole private cryptocurrencies, what contribution it will make to the Indian economy going forward. I think we need to be convinced with more credible explanations and answers,” he added.

The apex bank had initially banned the domestic lenders from facilitating investors’ trade in cryptocurrencies, but this was reversed after the Supreme Court struck down the order. It was alleged that some banks have resumed these services. Earlier this year in March, Das said that he had reason to believe that the government shares the concerns that were flagged by the RBI, according to the report.

On a parallel note, India has been taking steps towards its own form of a legally recognised digital rupee. Also called the Central Bank Digital Currency, the RBI is gearing up for a phased introduction of the asset. Das had mentioned last month that the digital currency would be rolled out with trial programmes by December. Unlike cryptocurrency, the Central Bank Digital Currency will be regulated. Most interestingly, it will not be an asset so to speak, but a digital reflection of the current monetary system. It will be exchangeable one-to-one with the Indian Rupee.

Cryptocurrencies on the other hand can be considered as commodities that have a set value to them, like gold or silver. That value will be uniform across the board, irrespective of the country it is being traded within, with the only factor to be considered being the currency conversion rate that would represent that value. Das had mentioned that the RBI was aiming to launch the central bank digital currency as a mass-scale digital asset. The RBI had put out a note stating that the central bank digital currency and the interest it held as an asset were universal. However, few countries have even come close to the pilot stage of launching such an endeavour.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor, Shaktikanta Das on September 9 said the central bank has ""serious concerns"" with regards to the financial stability of cryptocurrencies.

Attending an event on September 8, the RBI chief said, ""We have serious, major concerns on cryptocurrency w.r.t financial stability, have conveyed the same to government of India.""

This isn't the first time the RBI governor is voicing his concerns on cryptocurrency.

The central bank has conveyed the concerns on cryptocurrency to the government and it is up to the government to take a call on the matter, Das said, adding that there needs to be more clarity on the contribution of cryptocurrency to the economy.

On June 4, too, Das had repeated the critical stance on cryptocurrencies.

“We have major concerns on cryptocurrency, which we have conveyed to the government. With regard to advice to investors, well, central banks don't give any investment advice. It's up to each investor to make his own appraisal, to do his own due diligence and take a very careful call with regard to his own investments,"" Das said then.

Das’ latest comments are significant as the Government is in the advanced stages of finalising a national regulation on private cryptocurrencies. On August 16, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the Union Cabinet was soon expected to take up a bill to regulate cryptocurrency and its growing market in India.

""Cabinet note is ready on cryptocurrency bill. I am awaiting Cabinet to clear that,"" Sitharaman said during an interaction with reporters.

While the RBI is critical of private cryptocurrency, it is in favour of bringing out a central bank digital currency. The RBI is presently working on this model and may announce some decisions as early as the end of this year, central bank top officials have indicated in the past.

In the past, Sitharaman has made her stance on cryptocurrency clear, saying that the government was not looking to shut all options and that people will be given adequate windows to experiment with blockchain, bitcoins and cryptocurrency.

In late July, Sitharaman had informed Rajya Sabha that the government does not collect information on the number of cryptocurrency exchanges and investors in India. She also said that the Finance Ministry has received no information on whether some of these exchanges are involved in narcotic drug trafficking or money laundering.

According to data from crypto exchanges, there are approximately 1.5 crore Indians who have invested in cryptocurrencies holding worth Rs 15,000 crore, with more and more people starting to invest. There are 350 startups that operate in the blockchain and crypto space.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2019/01/Shaktikanta-Das_RBI_Reserve-bank_RBI-770x433.jpg',)",2 min read,"Shaktikanta DasReserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor, Shaktikanta Das on September 9 said the central bank has ""serious concerns"" with regards to the financial stability of cryptocurrencies.

Check latest rates",https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-prices-today-bitcoin-ether-cardano-dogecoin-surge-check-latest-crypto-rates-11631238669934.html,"Cryptocurrency prices today were trading with gains after crashing earlier this week with Bitcoin trading above $47,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency is up over 60% this year (year-to-date), though, much lower from nearly $65,000 record high it hit in April.

Bitcoin prices surged 2% to $47,067.77 as volatility eased after crashing on El Salvador's adopted the crypto asset as legal tender and the threat of a US lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc underscored the rocky road ahead for cryptocurrencies.

Ether, the coin linked to ethereum and second largest crypto by market capitalization, was up 1.5% to $3,519.5. Meanwhile, dogecoin prices gained to $0.25 whereas Cardano at $2.59, up nearly 2%. Other digital tokens like XRP rose 11% and Uniswap, Stellar, Litecoin gained over 1% over the last 24 hours.

Coinbase on Wednesday had said that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had threatened to sue the cryptocurrency exchange if it launches a program that lets users earn interest by lending crypto assets. The SEC issued Coinbase with a Wells notice, indicating the U.S. regulator will sue if the crypto exchange goes ahead with the launch of its interest-bearing ""Lend"" product for crypto assets, reported Reuters.

Earlier this week, Bitcoin prices plummeted from more than $52,000 per coin to $42,000, before recovering about half of that loss after El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender and the rollout stumbled in its first hours as El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the digital wallet used for transactions was not functioning.

2021-09-13T12:02:43.733030 12:00:24,Nasdaq,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are Falling Today",https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-bitcoin-ethereum-and-dogecoin-are-falling-today-2021-09-07,"What happened

The price of most cryptocurrencies fell on Tuesday morning after some hit new highs on Monday night. The price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) had dropped roughly 11% as of noon EDT, while the prices of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) had fallen roughly 12% and 18%, respectively.

The fall in prices seemed to be attributed to market volatility commonly associated with the cryptocurrencies, and as El Salvador looks to implement a law today that will see Bitcoin accepted as legal tender.

So what

Just before falling this morning, Bitcoin hit its highest price level since May at $52,000. Ethereum had traded close to $4,000 on Monday night, while Dogecoin at one point hit over $0.31 per token.

The price drops come on the day that the Latin American country El Salvador is set to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, making it the first country to do so. What this means is that citizens in the country can choose to use Bitcoin as payment and businesses must accept it in exchange for goods and services. In addition, citizens will be able to pay taxes in Bitcoin, Bitcoin exchanges will not be subject to capital gains taxes, and the price of Bitcoin will be tied to the dollar exchange rate.

In preparation for the new law, which is set to go in effect at 3 p.m. EDT today, the El Salvador government has purchased roughly $20 million in Bitcoin and installed 200 Bitcoin ATMs across the country. Government-run Bitcoin wallets will be loaded with $30 worth of Bitcoin for citizens who register. Reuters reported this morning that the El Salvador government ""had to unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand,"" as citizens register for the wallets.

Despite the issues, Leah Wald, CEO at the cryptocurrency and alternative asset management firm Valkryie Investments, said she was not surprised by the market's reaction today, as the news surrounding El Salvador has already been priced in.

""When this move was first announced, it didn't have nearly as big of an impact on price as some may have expected it might, possibly because El Salvador's population is less than New York City's, but also because the announcement was light on details and people were on the fence about how this was going to be implemented,"" Wald told CNBC. ""Transaction fees, processing times, and other hurdles also make this feel more like a beta test rather than a solution to many of the problems plaguing the country's poor.""

Wald added that if other Latin American countries begin accepting Bitcoin as legal tender, that could result in a ""parabolic"" move higher in crypto prices. Many experts believe Latin America could be ripe for adopting cryptocurrencies to help improve money transmission and for central banks that already deal with volatile currencies.

Now what

While the situation in El Salvador will be interesting to watch, I do not see anything that would change my view on certain cryptocurrencies.

I still feel quite bullish on Bitcoin and Ethereum. I am less bullish on Dogecoin, but can acknowledge that the cryptocurrency will likely move in tandem with the broader crypto market, and that it could move higher as stakeholders continue to update the network.

2021-09-13T12:02:44.806786 12:00:24,Cointelegraph,Cointelegraph Research: Is Solana an ‘Ethereum killer?’,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cointelegraph-research-is-solana-an-ethereum-killer,"Solana has been a trending topic due to the successive weeks of price increases seen by its SOL token. At the time of writing, SOL traded at around $207, which is an 11,400% surge from less than $2 back in January. At its present worth, Solana sits among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization with about $60 billion, claiming the sixth spot from Dogecoin (DOGE), according to Cointelegraph Markets.

One of the likely catalysts of this bullish momentum is funding from investors led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain in June. Solana secured $314 million, which will be used to further its technology in the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena. Notably, the investment took the form of SOL coin purchases rather than traditional equity shares.

Another key reason for Solana’s SOL price boom is the announcement of its fourth hackathon event slated for Oct. 8. Hackathons are targeted at developers whose projects are entered into a competition for a chance to win cash prizes and seed funding opportunities. This was perceived as a positive move for Solana, as it could help achieve wider adoption of its technology.

So, with Solana making headway, pundits can’t help but compare it with a similar programmable blockchain: Ethereum. Many have gone as far as to say that Solana could be an Ethereum killer, competing with Polkadot, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain.

What is Solana?

Solana is a layer-one blockchain network that can implement smart contracts. Founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former Qualcomm senior staff engineer manager, Solana is billed as the solution to the scaling issues of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Two years after its founding, Solana was able to land $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Multicoin Capital.

While Bitcoin (BTC) is widely accepted as a peer-to-peer form of money, Ethereum, on the other hand, is the platform for turning almost everything peer-to-peer. Solana is in the same league as Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities and layer-one infrastructure, but it brings along several other propositions.

Ethereum is still the top choice for building decentralized applications (DApps) and deploying smart contracts, but it can’t be denied that it’s plagued with legacy issues that it's trying to refine over time. Due to a lack of scalability, users occasionally face notoriously high gas fees. Although its transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) is already in motion — and is estimated to reduce such fees through an increased transaction throughput by applying shard chains — it isn’t expected to be fully merged to Ethereum’s mainnet until late 2021 or 2022. This is because the Beacon Chain that will coordinate all the shards is still under testing despite going live in December 2020.

On the other hand, Solana already has a PoS structure baked in as its consensus mechanism. However, the key innovation is in its proof-of-history (PoH) protocol. Under a PoS system, it may be difficult for validators to find chronological order in incoming blocks of transactions. PoH’s way around this is by establishing a historical record that cryptographically verifies the passage of time between two events.

Essentially, each Solana validator maintains its own “clock” that verifies the order of the event and hashes the passage of time. Therefore, it creates a sequence of hashes that are all achieved through a verifiable delay function. Yakovenko described it in 2018 as “a way to encode time as data.”

In other words, Solana can process transactions as they come as opposed to waiting for a block to be filled, which can be a lengthy process. This enables Solana to be more scalable, processing more transactions than some other blockchains.

Aside from this, Solana also brings in a block propagation protocol called Turbine, which breaks up important data into bits that can then be sent to nodes at a faster rate without taking up so much bandwidth. Solana also implements Tower BFT, an advanced version of the practical Byzantine fault-tolerant system in other delegated proof-of-stake blockchains. Tower BFT also compliments PoS, as it acts as the gatekeeper of the network.

An Ethereum killer?

Despite Ethereum being the superior network — with 7,000 nodes and 90,000 validators, compared with Solana’s 600 nodes and 1,000 validators — Solana is still dubbed an “Ethereum killer.” A large part of this is due to how its innovations address the perceived weaknesses in Ethereum.

Through the aforementioned PoH consensus in which validators maintain their own clock, transaction verification is cut short, as nodes no longer have to put in processing power to verify various timestamps. This improves the speed at which transactions are processed. Solana claims that it can process up to 60,000 transactions per second, which is a far cry from what Ethereum and even Bitcoin, Visa and XRP combined can offer.

Not only that, but transaction costs are significantly lower. As mentioned earlier, one of the biggest drawbacks for Ethereum users is that gas fees can be volatile and absurdly high. Users sometimes pay up to $65 to process a transaction. Last year, one user even paid $9,500 just to trade $120 on Uniswap. With Solana, fees can fluctuate near a mere $0.00025 per transaction — worlds apart from what Ethereum charges.

Joining the NFT trend

This year, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have been all the rage as artists, investors, collectors, traders and celebrities have begun to dabble in this blockchain-based movement. The majority of NFTs are still transacted over at the Ethereum network. However, Solana is slowly trying to grab a share of this nascent market.

A new NFT project called Degenerate Ape Academy became a test of its scalability as the entire collection of 10,000 apes sold out in just eight minutes. This caused the price of SOL to soar to $53.70 on Aug. 15, from trading at $44.11 just a day before.

The Solana NFT marketplace Solanart, which tracks the sales of the NFT collections, shows that the Degenerate Ape Academy NFTs are the dominant force in Solana NFT sales. The collection has already amassed a volume of 765,000 SOL tokens, which would translate to about $122 million at its current price.

In view of this, those who once enjoyed transacting on the Ethereum network could be tempted to change sides altogether. Nathan Ross, former chief marketing officer of dating app Hinge, tweeted about how Solana is a better fit for NFTs because it is faster, cheaper and easier than Ethereum.

Then, there’s also the integration with FTX, with the popular crypto derivatives platform launching its own NFT marketplace on Sept. 6.

Can Ethereum compete with Solana in the long run?

The question now is: Can Solana outdo the blockchain platforms of the top two altcoins? Ethereum 2.0 isn’t expected until sometime next year, as Phase 2 of the upgrade’s timeline is until late 2021 or early 2022. With the upgrade, proponents believe that transactions on Ethereum could be much cheaper and could even reach 100,000 per second, or more.

In spite of that, Solana’s design architecture allows it to keep pace, as it is theoretically made to scale with Moore’s law. This means that as computers become faster over time, so will Solana. Essentially, Solana is future-proofing itself through its scaling capabilities. If this proves to be the case, will Solana be the culprit for taking an ax to Ethereum?

Despite Ethereum being the superior network — with 7,000 nodes and 90,000 validators, compared with Solana’s 600 nodes and 1,000 validators — Solana is still dubbed an “Ethereum killer.” A large part of this is due to how its innovations address the perceived weaknesses in Ethereum.
The Solana NFT marketplace Solanart, which tracks the sales of the NFT collections, shows that the Degenerate Ape Academy NFTs are the dominant force in Solana NFT sales."

The chairman of India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance explains that cryptocurrency legislation in India will be “distinct and unique.” He added, “We have to balance stability and growth but we recognize how important this whole area of crypto is.”

Lawmaker Provides an Update on Crypto Legislation

Jayant Sinha, a lawmaker of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, talked about India’s cryptocurrency legislation Wednesday at an event organized by the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) of Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).

Sinha, who is the chairman of India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, explained that it is not possible for India to adopt the cryptocurrency policies used in advanced economies because the nation still does not have a full capital account convertibility. He clarified that India’s crypto policies will not follow the U.S., Japan, or El Salvador, the country which made bitcoin legal tender this week.

The lawmaker elaborated:

Our solution will have to be distinct and unique simply because of our unique circumstances. We have to balance stability and growth but we recognize how important this whole area of crypto is.

Furthermore, he noted that the committee will consider crypto legislation with national security in mind, adding: “We have to be very watchful about what happens to these crypto assets and cryptocurrencies. Use of these kinds of crypto instruments in terror financing and for domestic security threats is something we have to be mindful of.”

On Tuesday, a former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), R. Gandhi, said that crypto must be regulated as an asset or commodity in India and governed by existing laws. He explained that “Once cryptocurrencies are accepted, rules governing commodity exchanges could apply and the coins could be used to pay for goods and services,” Bloomberg conveyed, and quoted him as saying, “Then automatically people can start buying, selling and holding.”

According to a recent report, the Indian government is planning to regulate crypto assets as commodities and by use cases. Previously, there were reports of the government planning to ban all cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, allowing only central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to be issued by the RBI. Meanwhile, the central bank is planning to unveil a digital rupee model by the end of the year.

2021-09-13T12:02:46.959592 12:00:24,NBC News,"Ukraine is the latest country to legalize bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency slowly goes global",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/ukraine-latest-country-legalize-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-slowly-goes-global-n1278789,"Ukraine is the fifth country in as many weeks to lay down some ground rules for the cryptocurrency market, a sign that governments around the world are realizing that bitcoin is here to stay.

In a nearly unanimous vote, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted a law that legalizes and regulates cryptocurrency. The bill was set in motion in 2020 — and it now heads to the desk of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Until today, crypto in Ukraine has existed in a legal gray area.

Locals were allowed to buy and exchange virtual currencies, but companies and exchanges dealing in crypto were often under close watch by law enforcement.

According to the Kyiv Post, authorities have trended toward taking a combative stance when it comes to virtual cash, regarding it as a “scam,” raiding crypto-related businesses, and “often confiscating expensive equipment without any grounds.”

In August, for example, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) blocked a network of what it called “clandestine cryptocurrency exchanges” running in the capital city of Kyiv. The SBU claimed these exchanges were facilitating money laundering and providing anonymity of transactions.

The new legislation also spells out certain protections against fraud for those who own bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and lawmakers have taken a stab at defining core terminology in the world of crypto. If signed by the president, virtual assets, digital wallets, and private keys are terms that will be enshrined in Ukrainian law.

Unlike El Salvador’s move this week to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, Ukraine’s crypto law does not facilitate the rollout of bitcoin as a form of payment, nor does it put it on an equal footing with the hryvnia, the country’s national currency.

However, today’s vote by the former nuclear power is part of a wider push by Kyiv to lean into bitcoin.

By 2022, the country plans to open the cryptocurrency market to businesses and investors, according to the Kyiv Post. Top state officials have also been touting their crypto street cred to investors and venture capital funds in Silicon Valley.

On an official state visit to the U.S. last month, President Zelenskyy spoke of Ukraine’s budding “legal innovative market for virtual assets” as a selling point for investment, and Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation, said the country was modernizing its payment market so that its National Bank would be able to to issue digital currency.

But to bitcoin backers like Jeremy Rubin, Ukraine’s new law and political promises such as these don’t amount to much.

“Ukraine’s improved legal status for bitcoin is a laudable symbolic measure that we progress towards a world that respects individual rights universally,” said Rubin, CEO of bitcoin R&D lab Judica. “But it is only symbolic — bitcoin seeks neither permission nor forgiveness in its mission to protect persecuted communities from unjust governments.”

Just this week, El Salvador became the first country to both adopt bitcoin as legal tender and hold it on its balance sheet. President Nayib Bukele has essentially tethered his political fate to the outcome of this nationwide bitcoin experiment.

Two weeks ago, Cuba passed a law to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies, citing “reasons of socioeconomic interest.”

Last month, the U.S. proposed rules around crypto “brokers” in its $1 trillion infrastructure bill, and a new German law now allows funds previously barred from investing in crypto to allocate up to 20 percent to virtual currencies like bitcoin.

Panama appears to be next on deck. The Central American country is kicking around a draft of its own cryptocurrency law.","('https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_36/3504545/210909-bitcoin-ukraine-al-0802.jpg',)",3 min read,"Ukraine is the fifth country in as many weeks to lay down some ground rules for the cryptocurrency market, a sign that governments around the world are realizing that bitcoin is here to stay.

The latest comments from the lawmaker come amid uncertainty among Indian stakeholders due to long anticipation of regulation for Bitcoin and other crypto instruments. The country has a strong base of cryptocurrency exchanges and investors, but it so far has not recognised cryptocurrencies as a legal asset or currency.

Speaking at crypto asset conference HODL – 2021, organised by the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) of Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), Sinha said that India would not follow the US, Japan, or El Salvador in its approach toward cryptocurrencies.

“Our solution will have to be distinct and unique for India, simply because of our unique circumstances,” the MP and former Minister of State for Finance said.

He also said that the process of regulating cryptocurrencies would involve “stakeholder consultations”, after getting approvals from the parliament.

“It would be good if we have global standards and then if there is something above and beyond the global standards, that is unique to India, that can also be developed and worked,” Sinha said.

The lawmaker also noted that the country needs to consider legislation on cryptocurrencies that keeps national security concerns in mind.

In late January, the government proposed a bill to prohibit “all private cryptocurrencies” in the country and develop a framework for creating an official digital currency issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Just a couple of days after that bill got listed on the Lok Sabha bulletin, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur said while responding to a question raised in Rajya Sabha by saying that the government “does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coins”. He also underlined that the government would take all measures to eliminate use of crypto assets in financing illegal activities or as part of the payment system.

Those two major activities, along with an earlier RBI's ban on cryptocurrencies that was quashed by the Supreme Court last year, raised concerns among investors in the country.

However, major cryptocurrency stakeholders are optimistic and consider the fresh comments from Sinha as an indication of a positive move by the government.

“We agree with what Mr. Sinha mentioned,” said Avinash Shekhar, Co-CEO of Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange ZebPay. “India has its own unique strengths and issues when it comes to implementing laws and regulations around crypto and we're looking forward to a regulatory framework that matches these unique needs.”

Shekhar moderated the session with Sinha during the online conference. He expressed the need for an open discussion to address the government's concerns.

Nischal Shetty, CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, said the demand for cryptocurrencies had been steadily rising in the country and the move by the government could be a significant boost to the crypto ecosystem as a whole.

“We are optimistic and look forward to working closely with the government in regulating crypto in a manner that fosters innovation. We further hope that the government consults with the industry players and takes into consideration their recommendations before finalising on the bill,” he said.

Sharan Nair, Chief Business Officer of Bengaluru-based cryptocurrency trading platform CoinSwitch Kuber, also agreed to the comments made by Sinha.

“The laws around crypto can't simply be replicated from how other countries treat crypto,” he said. “In this process, crypto exchanges like CoinSwitch Kuber are more than willing to work alongside the regulators and policymakers to define laws that keep the nation's interest in mind.”

Similar to Indian cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms, global players in the cryptocurrency market are also seeing the country with a massive potential to help grow digital currencies around the world.

“Once we have the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in place, the industry will be well-poised for growth,” said Vincent Lau, Managing Director of International Operations, Seychelles-based Huobi Global. “We will continue to evolve our operations to meet the requirements of India's regulatory environment as part of our global expansion strategy.”

Market analysts believe that while it is difficult to come to a judgement simply from the comments made by the legislator, the government appears to be emphasising on a delayed approach to play safe in the field of cryptocurrencies.

“India's hesitation to welcome cryptos is understandable and it will be some time before it becomes widely accepted,” said Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst at brokerage firm ThinkMarkets that is based in London and Melbourne.

He added that Sinha merely underlined some of the known challenges that India would face with adopting cryptocurrencies, including issues over governance, taxation and national security.

Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst at New York-based multi-asset trading firm OANDA, said that India had too much resistance that it would not be one of the first adopters of Bitcoin.

“India is taking a cautious approach to cryptocurrencies and will be unable to create their own since they don't have full capital account convertibility. India has gone from banning cryptos to slowly trying to figure out how they can make it work for them,” he noted.

Rajya Sabha Member Amar Patnaik, who is also a part of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance led by Sinha, stressed on the need for a strong regulatory framework for crypto assets in the country.

“The priority should be to put in a regulatory and innovation sandbox both in SEBI (Security Exchange Board of India) and RBI and see prototype wise how it can marry with the Indian system,” Patnaik said during his session at the conference.

According to various reports, India is said to have about 15 million investors in cryptocurrencies and that number is growing steadily.

Globally, a report by Fortune Business Insights suggests that the cryptocurrency market will grow at 11.2 percent to $1,758 million (roughly Rs. 12,900 crores) by 2027.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_ether_stock_unsplash_1629707389109.jpg',)",4 min read,"The government will take a distinctive approach to regulate cryptocurrencies in India that will be different from the western markets, Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance Jayant Sinha said during an online event.

Following the crypto landmark, Cardano founder and Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, said many more nations will follow the Central American country in adopting the largest cryptocurrency. He also congratulated the entire cryptocurrency community, saying El Salvador's acceptance cements the belief that people should be in control of their money. Speaking at length about the nascent industry and his own association with it in a YouTube video, Hoskinson said he joined the Bitcoin space a “very long time ago” in 2011 and the industry has grown a lot since.

Earlier this week, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin a legal tender alongside the US dollar. However, the rollout faced serious glitches and the government had to suspend its cryptocurrency app Chivo briefly to add more servers and increase capacity amid a steady stream of people joining the platform. The new system is gradually stabilising. As of September 9 (1:38pm IST), Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.75 lakhs.

Hoskinson on September 8 uploaded a YouTube video where he talked about the promise El Salvador's move holds for Bitcoin. “In the coming years, many more nation-states will use crypto as part of their monetary policy, either as reserves in their central banks or using cryptocurrency rails for central bank settlements, or potentially just simply taking a cryptocurrency as El Salvador has done and make it the national currency.”

He also expressed confidence that the younger generation will trigger the mass adoption of cryptocurrency. “The majority of people under the age of 25 have a positive view on cryptocurrencies, and a lot of them own them. That's the future,” he said.

Hoskinson was the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation's education committee and established the Cryptocurrency Research Group in 2013. He is currently leading the research, design, and development of Cardano, a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2017.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/cryptocurrency_bitcoin_starbucks_el_salvador_reuters_1631176391985.jpg',)",2 min read,"Bitcoin recently made its historic debut as a legal tender in El Salvador.

Cryptocurrency prices continue to be in the red on September 8. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $2.o5 trillion, a 10.25 percent decrease over the last day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $244.82 billion, which makes a 51.81 percent increase.

Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin are among the cryptocurrencies that have seen a steep price volatility in the last few days. Bitcoin’s price tumbled more than 17 percent to $43,000 before paring some losses to trade down over 11 percent at $46,000. Earlier bitcoin had hit a session high of $52,948.

Smaller rival ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, fell 11.99 percent. Meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin has fallen over 16 percent.

Just before the steep fall, Bitcoin hit its highest price since May at $52,000, while Ethereum traded traded close to $4,000. Dogecoin had also touched $0.31 per token.

However, the next day Latin American country El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. Polls show Salvadorans are skeptical about using bitcoin and wary of the volatility of the cryptocurrency that critics say could increase regulatory and financial risks for financial institutions. Still, some residents are optimistic.

On Monday, El Salvador bought its first 400 of the cryptocurrency, temporarily pushing prices for bitcoin 1.49 percent higher to more than $52,680.

Some analysts fear the move to make bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar could muddy the outlook for El Salvador's quest to seek a more than $1 billion financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

After Bukele's bitcoin law was approved, rating agency Moody's downgraded El Salvador's creditworthiness, while the country's dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.

The launch of Bitcoin in El Salvador ran into snags following which shares of blockchain-related firms also fell as crypto stocks were hit by trading platform outages.

Coinbase said some transactions were delayed or canceled at ""elevated rates"" and that ""our apps may be experiencing errors."" The exchange later said issues with Coinbase card swipes were resolved and that transactions were going through normally.

The Gemini exchange said it temporarily entered a full-maintenance period to address an exchange-related issue that caused performance trouble. Coinbase shares slid 4.02 percent.

Anything related to cryptocurrencies appeared to suffer. Cryptocurrency miners Riot Blockchain fell 7.38 percent and Marathon Digital Holdings slipped 7.76 percent.

Shares of MicroStrategy Inc, a BTC buyer and business intelligence software firm, fell 7.64 percent.

But, the major focus was on El Salvador, where the government had to temporarily unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand.

Some analysts attributed such market volatility to El Salvador's implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender affecting user decision to buy in anticipation of the implementation and then selling it off.

“When this move was first announced, it didn’t have nearly as big of an impact on price as some may have expected it might, possibly because El Salvador’s population is less than New York City’s, but also because the announcement was light on details and people were on the fence about how this was going to be implemented,” Leah Wald, CEO at Valkyrie Investments told CNBC.

“Transaction fees, processing times, and other hurdles also make this feel more like a beta test rather than a solution to many of the problems plaguing the country’s poor,” Wald added.

Others disagreed with this reasoning. David Gerard, author of 'Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain,' told the Associated Press (AP) that the Bitcoin volatility on September 7 likely had little-to-nothing to do with El Salvador.

""My first guess was shenanigans, because it’s always shenanigans,"" Gerard said via email to AP.

""It's basically not responding to market forces or regulatory announcements,"" Gerard added. ""That kind of price pattern, where it plummets in a big way in minutes and then rises again, is one of the biggest factors affecting traders.""

A massive spike in volatility in the cryptocurrency market sunk the values of popular virtual coins including Bitcoin and Ether. The virtual coin market was painted in red on Wednesday after cryptocurrency prices plunged a day ago due to delays in trading.

The delay was observed after El Salvador ran into snags after becoming the first country to officially adopt Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, as legal tender.

Shares of blockchain-related firms also fell after trading was impacted by outages. However, the major reason behind the fall in cryptocurrency valuations was the El Salvador government’s move to temporarily unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand.

Cryptocurrency highlights | Check yesterday's prices

Bitcoin was trading at $45,474.51, down over 13.48 per cent compared to its value 24 hours at 12:00 pm. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation fell sharply to $855 billion and the trading volume over the past 24 hours rose to 3.19 billion. The jump in trading volume was primarily due to a heavy sell-off.

Ether mirrored Bitcoin and slipped after gaining momentum over the past few weeks. It was trading at $3,352.38, down 14.45 per cent. Ether’s market capitalisation fell below $400 as a result. Like Bitcoin, Ether’s trading volume rose due to higher sell-off.

All other altcoins encountered huge losses due to the trading delays. This was the first substantial fall in the value of altcoins after an impressive rally.

Commenting on the crash, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “It was a massively volatile 24 hours for the cryptocurrency investors. Bitcoin fell from $52,900 to just over $43,000 in a very short span. This event caused a massive liquidation as more than 329,000 investors and traders got liquidated.”

“The largest altcoin, Ether, quickly replicated Bitcoin's move. However, there was some recovery later in the session. Some Bitcoin whales seem to have bought the dip as the price recovered a bit immediately following the drop,” he added.

“President of El Salvador tweeted that they added 150 Bitcoins during the dip.”

However, the rollout stumbled in its first hours and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the digital wallet used for transactions was not functioning.

Tuesday’s selloff is the most significant break in the rebound that had lifted Bitcoin almost 75% since late July. Overall cryptocurrency market value fell about $300 billion in the past 24 hours, according to tracker CoinGecko.

The world's largest cryptocurrency staged a small recovery as Bitcoin prices today were at around $46,757, down 11%. Meanwhile, other digital coins followed the lead with ether fell over 11% to $3,471 whereas dogecoin and cardano prices plunged 15% and 12% to $0.26 and $2.5 respectively. Stellar, XRP, Uniswap also crashed in the range of 15-20% over the last 24 hours.

“Social media platforms were very cautious over the weekend that a plunge could occur following El Salvador’s big day,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., wrote in a note, as reported by Bloomberg. Some investors likely bought in anticipation of the nation implementing its Bitcoin law Sept. 7 and then moved to “sell the fact,"" he said.

According to experts, bitcoin was still in the bull market as long the price stayed above the $43,000 level.

Billionaire Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings and a long-time cryptocurrency bull, told Bloomberg the market for digital coins was running strong over the last eight weeks and became overbought. Interest from individual investors spiked on the back of large institutions jumping on board the crypto wagon, he said.

David Gerard, author of “Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain,"" told the Associated Press that Tuesday’s Bitcoin volatility likely had little to nothing to do with El Salvador. “My first guess was shenanigans, because it’s always shenanigans,"" Gerard said via email to AP.

“Bitcoin basically doesn’t respond to market forces or regulatory announcements,"" Gerard said. “That sort of price pattern, where it crashes hugely in minutes then goes back up again, is usually one of the big guys burning the margin traders."" Because Bitcoin is so thinly traded, it could also have been a big holder making a large sale to have cash, thus sending the market for a ride, Gerard said.

Shares of blockchain-related firms also fell as crypto stocks were hit by trading platform outages. But the major focus was on El Salvador, where the government had to temporarily unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand.

The price of bitcoin has plunged in minutes, wiping billions of dollars off the market.

The volatile cryptocurrency dropped from (USD) $50,257 to $43,351, before recovering some ground.

At 6am this morning it was trading at $47,048, having given up 9.11% in the past 24 hours.

The massive price crash came as El Salvador became the first country to introduce bitcoin as legal tender.

The price of bitcoin crashed overnight.

Other cryptos including ethereum have also suffered heavy losses.

“Horrible, horrible chart damage being done in $BTC and the rest of the #crypto market,” crypto trader and author Glen Goodman wrote on Twitter.

Trader and analyst Scott Melker blamed large-volume traders for bitcoin’s plunge.

“Leave it to whales to dump Bitcoin on the day that El Salvador makes it legal tender,” he wrote.

Economist Peter Schiff wrote: “Welcome to #Bitcoin #ElSalvador.

“Your national ‘currency’ just lost over 15% of its purchasing power in under an hour. Get used to it. Just another perfectly orchestrated pump-and-dump by the Bitcoin whales. Too bad this time they had to sacrifice an entire nation to pull it off.”

The plunge wiped billions off the overall market, which is worth about $2.35 trillion.

El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, wrote he would be “buying the dip.”

The plunge was also caused by centralised exchanges liquidating more than $3 billion in long positions.

Liquidations often happen when trades cannot fulfill margin requirements for holding long or short positions, which can exacerbate market drops.

It “looks like it was a standard de-leveraging event,” Rahul Rai from crypto investment firm BlockTower Capital told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin becomes legal tender in El Salvador

Salvadoran consumers can now legally use bitcoin — along with the US dollar which has been the official currency for two decades — to pay for any good or service.

The rollout has been met by much scepticism and fear over the effect of currency volatility on the small Central American country’s ailing economy, and hundreds have taken part in anti-bitcoin protests.

Remittances account for a fifth of El Salvador’s GDP — over $5.9 billion in 2020 — and are vital to revive an economy that contracted 7.9 per cent in 2020 due in large part to the coronavirus pandemic.

Thousands of Salvadorans were already using bitcoin before Tuesday — many of them in the coastal town of El Zonte, where hundreds of businesses and individuals rely on the cyber currency for everything from paying utilities bills to buying a can of soft drink.

Mike Petersen, director of the El Zonte Bitcoin Beach project, said the cryptocurrency had changed the lives of locals.

“They are now able to do online payments, they are able to send money back and forth with family members even hundreds of miles away,” he said.

The bold experiment got off to a bumpy start when shortly after midnight, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele complained the government-backed bitcoin app was not available on various internet platforms including Apple and Huawei.

Bukele used his Twitter account to press online stores to stock the app, or digital wallet, known as Chivo, and Huawei later began making it available. But when the app proved unable to cope with user registrations, the government unplugged it in order to connect to more servers and increase capacity.

Still, as the app began appearing on more platforms, Bukele was by afternoon retweeting videos posted on social media with people making payments using bitcoin at retailers in El Salvador including McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O).

""El Salvador is taking a great step forward today,"" said Carlos Garcia, who went to a booth at a San Salvador shopping mall giving out advice on how the new currency would work.

Starbucks' El Salvador unit said it was accepting bitcoin for purchases at its restaurants, drive-through facilities or to go.

Promising $30 of bitcoin for each user, Bukele has pushed for its adoption, saying it will help Salvadorans save $400 million a year on commissions for remittances, while giving access to financial services to people with no bank account.

""We must break the paradigms of the past,"" Bukele tweeted. ""El Salvador has the right to advance towards the first world.""

Bukele, 40, is one of the most popular presidents in the Americas, but has been accused of eroding democracy. Opinion polls showed Salvadorans are skeptical about using bitcoin, fearing its volatility and unsure of how it will work.

More than 1,000 people held a protest in San Salvador on Tuesday against the adoption of bitcoin, burning a tire and setting off fireworks in front of the Supreme Court.

As the currency's price wobbled, the government purchased an additional 150 bitcoins on Tuesday, worth around $7 million.

Still, the poorest may struggle to access the technology needed to make bitcoin work in El Salvador, where nearly half the population has no internet access and many more only have spotty connectivity.

""I'm going to continue suffering with or without bitcoin,"" said sweets seller Jose Herrera, who said he had trouble accessing a mobile phone.

Some say the adoption of bitcoin may fuel illicit transactions and financial instability. It has already muddied the outlook for more than $1 billion in financing that El Salvador is seeking from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

U.S. TENSIONS

Ahead of the launch, El Salvador bought 400 bitcoins worth around $20 million, Bukele said, helping drive its price above $52,000 for the first time since May. Hours later, bitcoin had weakened and last traded down 0.51% at $46,561.74.

Ethereum, another crypto currency, fell 0.32% to $3,404.05, while crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN.O) slid 4.18% after reporting delays in some transactions on its platform.

The change means businesses should accept payment in bitcoin alongside the U.S. dollar, which has been El Salvador's official currency since 2001 and will remain legal tender.

It remains unclear whether businesses will be penalized if they do not accept bitcoin.

In the run-up to the launch, the government installed ATMs that allow bitcoin to be converted into dollars and withdrawn without commission from the digital wallet Chivo.

Bukele blamed Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Huawei's app download platforms for the initial Chivo delay.

""Release him! @Apple @Google and @Huawei,"" Bukele wrote in a tweet, which was accompanied by a red-faced ""angry"" emoji.

The wallet was later available from Huawei and Apple.

A spokesman for Huawei said the company's platform showed less than a thousand installations by late afternoon on Tuesday.

""Like all innovations, El Salvador's bitcoin process has a learning curve,"" Bukele said in a tweet. ""Not everything will be achieved in a day, or in a month.""

In barely two years in office, Bukele has taken control of almost all levers of power. But although he has promised to clean up graft, the U.S. recently put some of his close allies on a corruption blacklist.

Last week, top judges appointed by Bukele's lawmakers ruled that he could serve a second term, breaking away from a constitutional rule that forbade consecutive terms.

Analysts fear the adoption of bitcoin, whose transaction records are distributed across the internet, beyond the reach of national jurisdictions, could encourage money laundering.

After the bitcoin law was approved, the ratings agency Moody's downgraded El Salvador's creditworthiness, while its dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.

The World Bank reiterated on Tuesday it could not help El Salvador in adopting bitcoin ""given environmental and transparency shortcomings,"" a bank spokesperson said.

Coinbase users were experiencing delayed or canceled transactions at ""elevated rates"" in the morning, the company said in an update on Twitter, but those issues were resolved by the afternoon. Major crypto exchanges Kraken and Gemini were also investigating delays and performance issues.

2021-09-06T12:03:04.413274 12:00:24,Yahoo Finance,"Crypto: Cardano (ADA) and Solana boom as bitcoin retakes $50,000",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-augusts-record-breaking-month-for-crypto-flows-means-for-bitcoin-163906276.html,"Over the past month, the crypto market has looked like a rising tide for all coins from Bitcoin to Cardano — but data suggest growth across the asset class hasn’t been equal.

Last week, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) breached $50,000 for the second time in two weeks, extending a rally that put a grim sell-off that started in May further in the rear-view mirror. While notable for its volatility, gains in the largest cryptocurrency may have gotten lost in the swell of rising prices across the entire asset class.

With a majority of decentralized finance and non-fungible token (NFT) trading happening on the Ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose by a third from $2,700 to $3,900, a growth rate 17% higher than BTC.

And other blockchain-based currencies such as the third highest valued cryptocurrency, Cardano (ADA-USD) has more than doubled while a newer one, Solana (SOL-USD), has more than tripled in value over the past month. ADA and SOL have continued to notch almost daily all time highs for the past two weeks.

In fact, new data released on Tuesday from MejoresApuestas.com showed Solana, Dogecoin and Cardano were the fastest-growing cryptos this year. All three posted four-digit increases to their market capitalization, with Solana's surging by 8,616%, and Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Cardano following with a 4,351% and 1,499% jump, respectively.

Bitcoin IRA, an investment platform that helps retail investors gain crypto exposure in their retirement accounts, saw “record-breaking inflows” of new accounts over the previous month.

“We broke our record in the first quarter right before Bitcoin ran from $45,000 to $65,000,” the company’s Chief Operating Officer, Chris Kline told Yahoo Finance. “We’re seeing the same pattern happen again. So this past month [August] felt a lot like April, but about twice as big.”

The search for growth in Bitcoin, Cardano, and others

Story continues

Currently, Bitcoin IRA has close to 120,000 client accounts, with approximately $2 billion in assets on the platform. Although the platform's heft doesn’t move the market, the swell of retail investors opening new accounts — especially for tax-advantaged IRA accounts — is an indicator of how curious investors are as they seek more traditional ways to participate in this market.

By rough approximation across all accounts, Kline said his clients hold 43% of their portfolio in bitcoin, 27% in ethereum, and the remaining 30% in a mix of other cryptocurrencies. The company offers 10 different cryptocurrencies in total, and is planning to more than double its crypto offerings in the fall.

Back in early May when Ethereum started rising to its all-time high above $4,000, the company saw a large influx of swaps or pairing from BTC to ETH. It signaled many of his clients were shifting their portfolios from BTC to ETH.

However, in recent weeks? “Not so much this time,” Kline told Yahoo Finance.

To be sure, there could be a lag. “Retail buyers are looking for percentage growth. While bitcoin reigns supreme, it has relatively stable growth while there is exponential growth happening on ethereum. That’s what really gets their attention,” Kline explained.

Bitcoin's August peak at $50K served as a “key technical and psychological level,” according to Will Clemente, an analyst at crypto mining and hardware broker Blockware Solutions.

Clemente told Yahoo Finance that for the last seven days, bitcoin’s price has remained in what he called a “volatility squeeze.” The idea being that buyers and sellers have balanced each other out, thereby reducing the asset’s typically high volatility.

But the analyst suggested that could be about to change. A volatility squeeze for bitcoin usually takes a week to two weeks to resolve.

Bitcoin Illiquid Supply (RSI)

“That’s not telling you the direction, it's just telling you that there’s going to be a big move soon,” said Clemente.

Analyzing price action alone remains a dominant, more contested method for predicting buyers and sellers around a cryptocurrency. But Clemente’s specialization, on-chain analysis, has quickly become a crucial tool kit of metrics for investors hoping to glean some clarity into the nascent asset-class.

Similar to technical analysis, the on-chain technique tries to forecast future moves based on supply and demand. However, it relies on a far larger quantity of data only available for assets operating on publicly available blockchains.

While Clemente cannot predict the price shift of Bitcoin, he pointed to a handful of supply shock ratios, such as the movement of coin supply from speculators to long term holders and the exchange supply ratio, which shows the number of Bitcoins available to buy on exchanges relative to the overall circulating supply.

Each of these metrics continue to rise higher after Bitcoin crested above $50,000, according to Clemente. Historically, supply shocks begin before the Bitcoin price moves upward.

The rise in Bitcoin’s price to above the long awaited $52,000 threshold isn’t just making investors money. It’s also a boon for the companies sellingmining rigs — specialised mining equipment — to Vietnam, where regulation around the new financial asset is still in the works.The country, which is one of the hubs formining around the world, is seeing cryptocurrency mining returning ‘with a vengeance’ after the rally, according to Quang Thuan, a local mining rig shop owner. He told local news agency VnExpress that sales in September have tripled as compared to last month alongside the rise in Bitcoin’s price — at least at his shop in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam’s capital.Multiple individuals from the local crypto mining community added that the overall computing power being put towards mining Bitcoin and other currencies has increased. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency hit the $50,000 price tag around the middle of August and has been surging since, albeit not at 2020 levels.At 1:10 pm Indian Standard Time (IST) , the currency was priced at $52,380.12.The trend, to be fair, isn’t particularly unsurprising. Research firm Finder recently reported that Vietnam had the largest percentage of crypto ownership around the world. The country was followed by others like Indonesia, India, Malaysia and Philippines. But, of the top five, Vietnam was the only country that had a history in crypto mining.Back in 2017, the country imported more than 7,000 rigs. Ironically, most of the rigs came from China.Currently, the use of cryptocurrencies to make purchases is illegal in the country.The central bank has repeatedly issued warnings that investing in cryptocurrencies increases the risk of falling prey to pyramid schemes and other scams.The locals, however, still choose to invest in various cryptocurrencies from Bitcoin to Chia coin. In February this year, during the pandemic, many internet cafes in the capital city switched over to cryptocurrency minings with footfall dropping drastically.After China’s clampdown on cryptocurrency mining across select provinces in the country, it had temporarily gotten easier to mine for Bitcoin. There were less people on the network, so Bitcoin adjusted its ‘hashrate’ to make itself easier and more profitable to mine.However, by August, the free ride was over. During the scheduled bi-weekly update, Bitcoin reset how tough it is for miners to mine — making it more difficult by 7.3%. This was the first signal that some of the miners that used to be in China are starting to settle into their homes overseas.Currently, the network difficulty stands at 17.615 terahash (t) — around halfway between the 25.046t highs of May and 13.673t lows of July.Crypto miners, many of whom used to be based in China till even the early months this year, had started moving out of the country around April. The Chinese government’s crackdowns on the mining industry have been well documented, and have also led to a rise in revenues for mining farms in North America. Revenue reports from firms like Bitfarms in Canada, have shown as much as 29% between the months of April to June this year.With a crypto bull run expected again, it’s likely that the sale of rigs in these countries will increase too. The California-based tech giant Nvidia missed its targets for GPUs designed specifically for crypto mining. It’s hoping to get out of the slump with Bitcoin crossing $53,000.On August 20, blockchain-analytics platform Glassnode had reported that a ‘golden cross’ between the 30-day and 60-day moving averages of Bitcoin’s hash ribbon was incoming, raising expectations of a bull run. A golden cross occurs when the average value of an asset in the short term crosses that of its average value in the long term.Other than Bitcoin’s rising prices though, the crypto industry has other reasons to be hopeful. Ethereum’s recent London Hard Fork, an update that rolled out early last month, and brought a new form of mining to Ethereum , is expected to bolster use for the token. Similarly, popular token Cardano also introduced proof-of-stake mining with an update recently.

SAN SALVADOR: El Salvador on Tuesday became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, a real-world experiment proponents say will lower commission costs for billions of dollars sent home from abroad but which critics warned may fuel money laundering.The plan spearheaded by the young, charismatic and popular President Nayib Bukele is aimed at allowing Salvadorans to save on $400 million spent annually in commissions for remittances, mostly sent from the United States.Last year alone remittances to El Salvador amounted to almost $6 billion, or 23% of its gross domestic product, one of the highest ratios in the world.Polls show Salvadorans are skeptical about using bitcoin and wary of the volatility of the cryptocurrency that critics say could increase regulatory and financial risks for financial institutions. Still, some residents are optimistic.""It's going to be beneficial ... we have family in the United States and they can send money at no cost, whereas banks charge to send money from the United States to El Salvador,"" said Reina Isabel Aguilar, a store owner in El Zonte Beach, some 49 km (30 mi) southwest of capital San Salvador.El Zonte is part of the so-called Bitcoin Beach geared toward making the town one of the world's first bitcoin economies.In the run-up to the launch, the government has already been installing ATMs of its Chivo digital wallet that will allow the cryptocurrency to be converted into dollars and withdrawn without commission, but Bukele on Monday looked to temper expectations for quick results and asked for patience.""Like all innovations, El Salvador's bitcoin process has a learning curve. Every road to the future is like this and not everything will be achieved in a day, or in a month,"" Bukele said on Twitter, a platform he often uses to talk up his achievements or excoriate opponents.On Monday, El Salvador bought its first 400 of the cyrptocurrency, temporarily pushing prices for bitcoin 1.49% higher to more than $52,680. The cryptocurrency has been notoriously volatile. Just this spring, it rose over $64,000 in April and fell almost as low as $30,000 in May.Some analysts fear the move to make bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar could muddy the outlook for El Salvador's quest to seek a more than $1 billion financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).After Bukele's bitcoin law was approved, rating agency Moody's downgraded El Salvador's creditworthiness, while the country's dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.But Bukele, who does not shy away from controversy, on Monday retweeted a video that showed face superimposed on actor Jaime Foxx in a scene from Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino's film about American slavery. The video portrayed Bukele whipping a slave trader who had the IMF emblem emblazoned on his face.Bukele later deleted the retweet.His own tweet said: ""we must break the paradigms of the past.
