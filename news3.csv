Whether you’re doing business in a bank or trading digital coins, you cannot escape the risks of falling victim to scams, hacking, and even theft. Authorities would usually warn people about these problems in hopes that they would observe precautions when making transactions involving money or some kind of asset. Crypto investors are no exception. They, too, are subject to the prevalence of cybercrimes that challenge developers to enhance the security features of the blockchain network.

One way that crypto experts try to prevent malicious attacks on the crypto network is by having a more secure system. For instance, there is what they call “cryptocurrency difficulty” that makes verification of digital transactions more challenging among miners, yet it can improve the security of the network. Attackers would need enormous resources to manipulate or take control of the whole system. It ensures that all participants can mine and trade cryptos in a more secure manner.

Looking for a fast and secure online trading platform? Here’s The Bitcoin Code trading platform for beginners - the choice that might suit your financial goals.

Understanding Cryptocurrency Difficulty

Blockchain network is prone to malicious attacks. In fact, there have already been cases of hacking and theft in many digital trading platforms, which resulted in millions of assets lost. The technology that facilitates such transactions is not perfect, although the security features are being upgraded to address any loopholes. On matters involving network security, the concept of cryptocurrency difficulty is an important one.

Basically, it is a measure of how difficult a mining process is in a blockchain for a specific cryptocurrency. The higher the crypto difficulty, the greater the computing power is needed to verify transactions that enter on a blockchain. This is also being applied as a parameter to keep the average time between blocks steady as the crypto network’s hash power changes. For security concerns, the system is deemed crucial to safeguard the network against malicious attacks.

Cryptocurrency difficulty keeps the system secure and represents the computing power needed to mine a block. The network stability is also maintained in the process as the time required to find a new block is subject to it and also algorithm operations. Measuring the cryptocurrency difficulty of a new block would require an understanding of the hash power. This represents the combined computational power used in mining and processing the transactions on the blockchain.

What are Random Hashes?

A hash refers to the alphanumeric code used to represent words or data. Crypto miners would usually take a batch of data and run it through a hash algorithm which functions to create random hash codes. Before new data is added to the blockchain, miners must compete to produce a hash lower or equal to a numeric value. The basic requirement in this process is that a hash must correspond to the difficulty.

Individual miners and mining pools contribute to the computational power through mining rigs to process the data and produce the hashes. The hash power of a network represents the total hash rates of the mining rigs. However, it would take millions of hashes before the numeric value can be met and new coins are given to the successful miner, primarily because each hash is created randomly. In certain ways, the hashing process works similarly to the lottery system.

Advantages of Cryptocurrency Difficulty

The improved stability and security of the blockchain network are the major benefits of cryptocurrency difficulty. This encourages a secure and efficient flow of digital transactions. To understand how the system achieves this end, below are brief discussions on the matter:

Steady Rate of New Blocks - blockchain network needs to produce a new block at a steady average rate; thus, the software is set to automatically adjust the target hash above or below a certain level, resulting in higher or lower difficulty. One example of a pre-set crypto platform is bitcoin which adds a new block to the blockchain every 10 minutes on average.

Network Security - when there is a higher cryptocurrency difficulty, more hashes are needed to reach the target hash requirement. This process makes it very difficult and expensive for attackers to gain control of the blockchain network.

Conclusion:

The foregoing facts simply show how important and beneficial the cryptocurrency difficulty is in maintaining the integrity and stability of the blockchain network. However, as new challenges threaten the security of digital platforms, system upgrades are always necessary to keep the trust and confidence of crypto investors and traders.","('https://tpn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/1224/executium-5hcV51EeeWc-unsplash.jpg',)",none
2021-09-13,CNA,Hedge fund Brevan Howard expands further into cryptocurrency as institutional interest jumps,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/brevan-howard-hedge-fund-expansion-cryptocurrency-2174156,"LONDON: Hedge fund Brevan Howard said on Monday (Sep 13) that it was expanding its cryptocurrency business, the latest sign that institutional interest in the asset class is gaining momentum.

Brevan, more famous for its bets on macroeconomic trends, has been among the most high-profile of major hedge funds moving into the world of cryptocurrency trading, known for its volatile markets and scope for outsize gains.

The asset manager said it would launch a new unit, BH Digital, to manage cryptocurrency and digital assets. It said it would also hire Colleen Sullivan, currently CEO of the digital arm of trading firm CMT, to lead private and venture investments in cryptocurrency.

Brevan's expansion comes on the back of other high-profile money managers venturing into this space in recent months. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has invested in bitcoin while Man Group trades bitcoin futures.

An annual report published by PriceWaterHouseCoopers, Alternative Investment Management Association and Elwood Asset Management found total assets under management of cryptocurrency hedge funds globally nearly doubled to US$3.8 billion in 2020 from US$2 billion in the previous year.

The rise in institutional interest comes as a wider range of cryptocurrencies become available while bitcoin and ethereum, the world's best known coins, are trading well below their record highs.

""What was initially seen as something of a fad now appears to be becoming a more permanent structure of the financial landscape and this has started to see what were initially fringe financial instruments moving to become more mainstream and very much forcing the institutional interest we are now seeing,"" said Stuart Cole, head macroeconomist at London-based Equiti Capital.

The rise in institutional interest has rippled over to the trading space. Eurex, Deutsche Boerse's derivatives exchange, launched bitcoin futures on Monday to feed on the growing interest.

Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, says institutional interest in trading cryptocurrencies has soared this year.

In its second quarter letter to shareholders, Coinbase said turnover of cryptocurrencies hit a record US$462 billion in the three months to June. Of this amount, US$317 billion was traded by institutional investors and the rest by retail clients.

In the year-ago period, total turnover was US$28 billion, US$17 billion of which was institutional trading.

While hedge funds and exchanges have scrambled to capture trading revenues, global banks have been relatively slow to latch on to the trend, with their wealth management clients largely pushing them to offer cryptocurrency trading.

Citigroup is considering offering bitcoin futures trading for some institutional clients while Standard Chartered has formed a newly minted research division for cryptocurrencies.","('https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--9xACjrku--/fl_relative%2Cg_south_east%2Cl_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters%2Cw_0.1/f_auto%2Cq_auto/c_fill%2Cg_auto%2Ch_676%2Cw_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2021-09-13t074701z_1_lynxmpeh8c08h_rtroptp_3_crypto-currency.jpg?itok=y21UVQN3',)",none

About Cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.

Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain that serves as a public financial transaction database.

Onto DEX…

“Because a DEX (decentralised exchange) does not own the data, even the authorities can't really go to the developer of the exchange and say I want the data.” WazirX CEO, Nischal Shetty

Advantages of DEX

Decentralisation is at the core of all the benefits that can be drawn off blockchain technology.Every app that is built on a blockchain platform today, boasts the fact that it is decentralised. So, it’s not surprising that crypto exchanges also want to jump on the bandwagon and many are on the path to launch their own decentralised exchange (DEX), where there’s no middle man, just traders swapping tokens with each other.There are currently more than 35 DEXs in existence globally including Uniswap, Kyber, and Bancor — popular alternatives to centralised exchanges. In India, WazirX has plans to launch a DEX of its own sometime this month, CEO Nischal Shetty told the Economic Times in July. The crypto exchange boasts of 7.3 million users as of August, with more than half of its growth this year coming from Tier-II and Tier-III cities.Before we get to what ais, it’s important to understand what a centralised exchange is.Pretty much any crypto exchange in the world today is a centralised exchange. This means that when you deposit your cryptocurrency onto the platform, you’re basically transferring it to a wallet that’s held by the exchange. When you deposit fiat currency — whether its the US dollar or the Indian rupee — in order to buy crypto, that crypto is also held in the exchange’s centralised wallet, till you decide to liquidate the crypto and withdraw the money back into your regular bank account.Crypto wallets have two keys, a public and private keys. Public keys are shared with anyone who wants to send you cryptocurrency, while a private key is what you use to access your own wallet. For exchanges, these are simplified even further so you never have to interact with either of these keys, which — unlike passwords — aren’t the easiest to remember.“Any crypto wallet that won’t give you your private keys should be avoided at all costs,” billionaire Elon Musk had warned once.It’s not that centralised exchanges are necessarily risky, but it does mean that the investor does not have direct control over their purchases or holdings. In a centralised exchange, when you want to sell crypto, the exchange goes and finds another person who wants to buy your crypto. It facilitates this transaction and if you want to withdraw your crypto, you will essentially have to ask the exchange to sign a transaction on your behalf.If you understood what a centralised exchange is, you can probably guess what a DEX is now. The primary difference, of course, is in the fact that you have access to the private key for your own crypto wallet. You’re not dependent on a central entity to hold your cryptocurrency.In some decentralised exchanges, the entire process of buying and selling is performed ‘on chain’ — it is completely transparent. You do not have to depend on a third party to facilitate the transaction, which may potentially charge you extra transaction fees on every trade. This is one of the reasons why DEX transactions are often cheaper.The two obvious advantages of DEXs are security and sovereignty. The fact that they are decentralised means there is no one entity that can be hacked, whereas a centralised exchange is more vulnerable to exploits, which in turn could affect its users. In addition, users retain access to their wallets and hence retain control of their own crypto holdings.In essence, a DEX is basically a bunch of crypto wallets that are trading with each other. Which leads us to the third big advantage — privacy. Unlike centralized exchanges, a DEX doesn’t necessarily require the user to go through the know your customer (KYC) process, meaning you do not hand over your documents to any one entity, and thereby risk giving access to others if that entity is hacked.However, KYC documents are also essential in the financial system, because they allow governments and authorities to track the flow of money. Like most things to do with privacy, this could be a double-edged sword in the long run.AMMs have been backed by some of the biggest venture funds in the world and billionaires. The idea is simple, the AMM is essentially an automated order book that facilitates liquidity on the exchange. Uniswap was the first DEX with an AMM to emerge back in 2018.A centralised exchange doesn’t just find buyers for you, it also works with large traders to ensure that there’s enough liquidity on the exchange and you can sell your crypto virtually whenever you want. Liquidity means there’s enough supply for available demand. If liquidity is low it will be difficult for you to sell crypto, and vice versa.AMMs look to solve the liquidity problem without depending on large traders using smart contracts — self-executing computer programs that ensure liquidity on the exchange. But the benefits of having an AMM in play don’t stop with liquidity. Eliminating the middle-man also means that the transaction fees won’t change while a transaction is happening.The AMM algorithms have pre-defined requirements for an entity or individual to become a liquidity provider. Anyone who meets these criteria can become part of the liquidity pool, and hence maintain continuous trading.Disclaimer: This is a sponsored post in partnership with WazirX.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/86164969/what-is-dex-decentralised-exchanges-give-investors-more-control-and-more-profit.jpg?imgsize=80492',)",none

Cardano’s recent highs

Two days after Bitcoin produced its 700,000th block amidst much fanfare, another important cryptocurrency has announced a milestone. ‘’ Cardano revealed that it has successfully rolled out the scheduled Alonzo upgrade , which introduces the much awaited ‘smart contracts’ feature — the same feature which allows for non-fungible tokens (). But the creators of the platform have warned that the first use cases may not be seen for years to come.The update puts Cardano in direct competition with Ethereum, giving it more flexibility in terms of applications like non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ), automated lending and more.Like Ethereum, the Cardano blockchain is also based on the proof-of-stake system, which requires miners to put up their own stake of crypto. Only those with the largest stake will be rewarded for their services. It reduces the overall computing power required for mining on a public blockchain and hence is more environmentally sound.To be fair, Ethereum still leads Cardano in terms of overall market capitalisation. On September 12, Cardano had a market cap of around $82 billion against Ethereum’s whopping $400 billion market cap.However, Cardano has risen from being the simple underdog to being among the top five cryptocurrencies in the world in terms of market cap. It is currently placed in third position, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.Ethereum’s London Hard Fork rolled out on August 5 and is seen as the first step towards ‘version 2.0’ of the platform, which will arrive next year.The new system moves the Ethereum blockchain towards the proof-of-stake system like Cardano and reduces not only its environmental footprint but also the transaction fees required on the network. Ether’s price — the cryptocurrency which fuels the Ethereum blockchain — has risen from around $2,700 on August 5 to $3,200 on September 12, whereas Cardano’s price remains around the $2 mark.“It’s only just the beginning. But this is still a moment for celebration. As a community, we have been on an incredible journey together. Rightly, we should allow ourselves to acknowledge the tremendous efforts made by so many to get here. This will also be a time for reflection on the challenges we've collectively overcome,” wrote Tim Harrison, Marketing and Communications Director of Input Output Global, the creators of Cardano, in a blog post.While Cardano’s price may be a fraction of what Ethereum costs right now, the cryptocurrency has been reaching its own highs. The market cap for ADA, Cardano’s native token, has almost doubled over the past month. On August 31, the token defied crash predictions to rise to an all time high of $2.56 — providing investors with over 150% returns.As mentioned before, introducing smart contracts makes the Cardano blockchain more flexible and useful, which in turn means it will have more usage. Which is one of the main reasons why many in the blockchain and DeFi world picked Ethereum over Bitcoin in the first place.Harrison warned that while the expectations from Alonzo are high, some may be unreasonable. “Cardano watchers may be expecting a sophisticated ecosystem of consumer-ready DApps available immediately after the upgrade. Expectations need to be managed here. We should remember that another well-known blockchain project which launched in July 2015 had to wait over two years before its first DApp (something to do with cats?) gained real user traction,” he wrote, referencing Cryptokitties, which was the first DApp built on the Ethereum blockchain.

2021-09-13,RT,India looks to tax cryptocurrency exchanges and trades – report,https://www.rt.com/business/534674-india-crypto-trade-tax/,"The authorities in India are considering taxing cryptocurrency trades and ecosystem in the country, news website ET Now reported on Monday, citing its sources.

According to people familiar with the matter, the government feels that an activity that generates income should be taxed. The country’s tax department favors taxing cryptocurrency exchange and trades, but that doesn’t mean that they would be categorized as a valid asset class, the media said.

Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Rama Subramaniam Gandhi said last week that cryptocurrencies must be regulated as an asset or commodity in India and governed by existing laws. He added that regulators should be aware of an individual’s crypto investments from a tax perspective and that such information should be shared with exchanges.

A recent study from market research firm Finder showed India ranked second in the world in terms of crypto adoption, with 30% of individuals polled saying they hold cryptocurrencies.

According to the report, in India, bitcoin is the most popular coin to own (16%), followed by ripple (8%), ethereum (6%) and bitcoin cash (6%). Despite the steps taken by the Indian government to severely restrict digital assets, cryptocurrency investments in the country increased from $923 million in April 2020 to almost $6.6 billion by May 2021.

2021-09-13,The Portugal News,Cryptocurrency Difficulty: How Important Is It for Blockchain Network?,https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2021-09-13/cryptocurrency-difficulty-how-important-is-it-for-blockchain-network/62330,"Security threats are a general concern in financial transactions. Whether you’re doing business in a bank or trading digital coins, you cannot escape the risks of falling victim to scams, hacking, and even theft. Authorities would usually warn people about these problems in hopes that they would observe precautions when making transactions involving money or some kind of asset. Crypto investors are no exception. They, too, are subject to the prevalence of cybercrimes that challenge developers to enhance the security features of the blockchain network.

By Advertiser, in Business, Finance · 13 Sep, 12:35 · 0 Comments

One way that crypto experts try to prevent malicious attacks on the crypto network is by having a more secure system. For instance, there is what they call “cryptocurrency difficulty” that makes verification of digital transactions more challenging among miners, yet it can improve the security of the network. Attackers would need enormous resources to manipulate or take control of the whole system. It ensures that all participants can mine and trade cryptos in a more secure manner.

Looking for a fast and secure online trading platform? Here’s The Bitcoin Code trading platform for beginners - the choice that might suit your financial goals.

Understanding Cryptocurrency Difficulty

Blockchain network is prone to malicious attacks. In fact, there have already been cases of hacking and theft in many digital trading platforms, which resulted in millions of assets lost. The technology that facilitates such transactions is not perfect, although the security features are being upgraded to address any loopholes. On matters involving network security, the concept of cryptocurrency difficulty is an important one.

Basically, it is a measure of how difficult a mining process is in a blockchain for a specific cryptocurrency. The higher the crypto difficulty, the greater the computing power is needed to verify transactions that enter on a blockchain. This is also being applied as a parameter to keep the average time between blocks steady as the crypto network’s hash power changes. For security concerns, the system is deemed crucial to safeguard the network against malicious attacks.

Cryptocurrency difficulty keeps the system secure and represents the computing power needed to mine a block. The network stability is also maintained in the process as the time required to find a new block is subject to it and also algorithm operations. Measuring the cryptocurrency difficulty of a new block would require an understanding of the hash power. This represents the combined computational power used in mining and processing the transactions on the blockchain.

What are Random Hashes?

A hash refers to the alphanumeric code used to represent words or data. Crypto miners would usually take a batch of data and run it through a hash algorithm which functions to create random hash codes. Before new data is added to the blockchain, miners must compete to produce a hash lower or equal to a numeric value. The basic requirement in this process is that a hash must correspond to the difficulty.

Individual miners and mining pools contribute to the computational power through mining rigs to process the data and produce the hashes. The hash power of a network represents the total hash rates of the mining rigs. However, it would take millions of hashes before the numeric value can be met and new coins are given to the successful miner, primarily because each hash is created randomly. In certain ways, the hashing process works similarly to the lottery system.

Advantages of Cryptocurrency Difficulty

The improved stability and security of the blockchain network are the major benefits of cryptocurrency difficulty. This encourages a secure and efficient flow of digital transactions. To understand how the system achieves this end, below are brief discussions on the matter:

Steady Rate of New Blocks - blockchain network needs to produce a new block at a steady average rate; thus, the software is set to automatically adjust the target hash above or below a certain level, resulting in higher or lower difficulty. One example of a pre-set crypto platform is bitcoin which adds a new block to the blockchain every 10 minutes on average.

Network Security - when there is a higher cryptocurrency difficulty, more hashes are needed to reach the target hash requirement. This process makes it very difficult and expensive for attackers to gain control of the blockchain network.

Conclusion:

The foregoing facts simply show how important and beneficial the cryptocurrency difficulty is in maintaining the integrity and stability of the blockchain network. However, as new challenges threaten the security of digital platforms, system upgrades are always necessary to keep the trust and confidence of crypto investors and traders.","('https://tpn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/1224/executium-5hcV51EeeWc-unsplash.jpg',)",none
2021-09-13,CNA,Hedge fund Brevan Howard expands further into cryptocurrency as institutional interest jumps,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/brevan-howard-hedge-fund-expansion-cryptocurrency-2174156,"LONDON: Hedge fund Brevan Howard said on Monday (Sep 13) that it was expanding its cryptocurrency business, the latest sign that institutional interest in the asset class is gaining momentum.

Brevan, more famous for its bets on macroeconomic trends, has been among the most high-profile of major hedge funds moving into the world of cryptocurrency trading, known for its volatile markets and scope for outsize gains.

The asset manager said it would launch a new unit, BH Digital, to manage cryptocurrency and digital assets. It said it would also hire Colleen Sullivan, currently CEO of the digital arm of trading firm CMT, to lead private and venture investments in cryptocurrency.

Brevan's expansion comes on the back of other high-profile money managers venturing into this space in recent months. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has invested in bitcoin while Man Group trades bitcoin futures.

An annual report published by PriceWaterHouseCoopers, Alternative Investment Management Association and Elwood Asset Management found total assets under management of cryptocurrency hedge funds globally nearly doubled to US$3.8 billion in 2020 from US$2 billion in the previous year.

The rise in institutional interest comes as a wider range of cryptocurrencies become available while bitcoin and ethereum, the world's best known coins, are trading well below their record highs.

""What was initially seen as something of a fad now appears to be becoming a more permanent structure of the financial landscape and this has started to see what were initially fringe financial instruments moving to become more mainstream and very much forcing the institutional interest we are now seeing,"" said Stuart Cole, head macroeconomist at London-based Equiti Capital.

The rise in institutional interest has rippled over to the trading space. Eurex, Deutsche Boerse's derivatives exchange, launched bitcoin futures on Monday to feed on the growing interest.

Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, says institutional interest in trading cryptocurrencies has soared this year.

In its second quarter letter to shareholders, Coinbase said turnover of cryptocurrencies hit a record US$462 billion in the three months to June. Of this amount, US$317 billion was traded by institutional investors and the rest by retail clients.

In the year-ago period, total turnover was US$28 billion, US$17 billion of which was institutional trading.

While hedge funds and exchanges have scrambled to capture trading revenues, global banks have been relatively slow to latch on to the trend, with their wealth management clients largely pushing them to offer cryptocurrency trading.

Citigroup is considering offering bitcoin futures trading for some institutional clients while Standard Chartered has formed a newly minted research division for cryptocurrencies.","('https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--9xACjrku--/fl_relative%2Cg_south_east%2Cl_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters%2Cw_0.1/f_auto%2Cq_auto/c_fill%2Cg_auto%2Ch_676%2Cw_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2021-09-13t074701z_1_lynxmpeh8c08h_rtroptp_3_crypto-currency.jpg?itok=y21UVQN3',)",none

About Cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.

Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain that serves as a public financial transaction database.

“Because a DEX (decentralised exchange) does not own the data, even the authorities can't really go to the developer of the exchange and say I want the data.” WazirX CEO, Nischal Shetty

Advantages of DEX

Decentralisation is at the core of all the benefits that can be drawn off blockchain technology.Every app that is built on a blockchain platform today, boasts the fact that it is decentralised. So, it’s not surprising that crypto exchanges also want to jump on the bandwagon and many are on the path to launch their own decentralised exchange (DEX), where there’s no middle man, just traders swapping tokens with each other.There are currently more than 35 DEXs in existence globally including Uniswap, Kyber, and Bancor — popular alternatives to centralised exchanges. In India, WazirX has plans to launch a DEX of its own sometime this month, CEO Nischal Shetty told the Economic Times in July. The crypto exchange boasts of 7.3 million users as of August, with more than half of its growth this year coming from Tier-II and Tier-III cities.Before we get to what ais, it’s important to understand what a centralised exchange is.Pretty much any crypto exchange in the world today is a centralised exchange. This means that when you deposit your cryptocurrency onto the platform, you’re basically transferring it to a wallet that’s held by the exchange. When you deposit fiat currency — whether its the US dollar or the Indian rupee — in order to buy crypto, that crypto is also held in the exchange’s centralised wallet, till you decide to liquidate the crypto and withdraw the money back into your regular bank account.Crypto wallets have two keys, a public and private keys. Public keys are shared with anyone who wants to send you cryptocurrency, while a private key is what you use to access your own wallet. For exchanges, these are simplified even further so you never have to interact with either of these keys, which — unlike passwords — aren’t the easiest to remember.“Any crypto wallet that won’t give you your private keys should be avoided at all costs,” billionaire Elon Musk had warned once.It’s not that centralised exchanges are necessarily risky, but it does mean that the investor does not have direct control over their purchases or holdings. In a centralised exchange, when you want to sell crypto, the exchange goes and finds another person who wants to buy your crypto. It facilitates this transaction and if you want to withdraw your crypto, you will essentially have to ask the exchange to sign a transaction on your behalf.If you understood what a centralised exchange is, you can probably guess what a DEX is now. The primary difference, of course, is in the fact that you have access to the private key for your own crypto wallet. You’re not dependent on a central entity to hold your cryptocurrency.In some decentralised exchanges, the entire process of buying and selling is performed ‘on chain’ — it is completely transparent. You do not have to depend on a third party to facilitate the transaction, which may potentially charge you extra transaction fees on every trade. This is one of the reasons why DEX transactions are often cheaper.The two obvious advantages of DEXs are security and sovereignty. The fact that they are decentralised means there is no one entity that can be hacked, whereas a centralised exchange is more vulnerable to exploits, which in turn could affect its users. In addition, users retain access to their wallets and hence retain control of their own crypto holdings.In essence, a DEX is basically a bunch of crypto wallets that are trading with each other. Which leads us to the third big advantage — privacy. Unlike centralized exchanges, a DEX doesn’t necessarily require the user to go through the know your customer (KYC) process, meaning you do not hand over your documents to any one entity, and thereby risk giving access to others if that entity is hacked.However, KYC documents are also essential in the financial system, because they allow governments and authorities to track the flow of money. Like most things to do with privacy, this could be a double-edged sword in the long run.AMMs have been backed by some of the biggest venture funds in the world and billionaires. The idea is simple, the AMM is essentially an automated order book that facilitates liquidity on the exchange. Uniswap was the first DEX with an AMM to emerge back in 2018.A centralised exchange doesn’t just find buyers for you, it also works with large traders to ensure that there’s enough liquidity on the exchange and you can sell your crypto virtually whenever you want. Liquidity means there’s enough supply for available demand. If liquidity is low it will be difficult for you to sell crypto, and vice versa.AMMs look to solve the liquidity problem without depending on large traders using smart contracts — self-executing computer programs that ensure liquidity on the exchange. But the benefits of having an AMM in play don’t stop with liquidity. Eliminating the middle-man also means that the transaction fees won’t change while a transaction is happening.The AMM algorithms have pre-defined requirements for an entity or individual to become a liquidity provider. Anyone who meets these criteria can become part of the liquidity pool, and hence maintain continuous trading.Disclaimer: This is a sponsored post in partnership with WazirX.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/86164969/what-is-dex-decentralised-exchanges-give-investors-more-control-and-more-profit.jpg?imgsize=80492',)",none

Two days after Bitcoin produced its 700,000th block amidst much fanfare, another important cryptocurrency has announced a milestone. ‘’ Cardano revealed that it has successfully rolled out the scheduled Alonzo upgrade , which introduces the much awaited ‘smart contracts’ feature — the same feature which allows for non-fungible tokens (). But the creators of the platform have warned that the first use cases may not be seen for years to come.The update puts Cardano in direct competition with Ethereum, giving it more flexibility in terms of applications like non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ), automated lending and more.Like Ethereum, the Cardano blockchain is also based on the proof-of-stake system, which requires miners to put up their own stake of crypto. Only those with the largest stake will be rewarded for their services. It reduces the overall computing power required for mining on a public blockchain and hence is more environmentally sound.To be fair, Ethereum still leads Cardano in terms of overall market capitalisation. On September 12, Cardano had a market cap of around $82 billion against Ethereum’s whopping $400 billion market cap.However, Cardano has risen from being the simple underdog to being among the top five cryptocurrencies in the world in terms of market cap. It is currently placed in third position, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.Ethereum’s London Hard Fork rolled out on August 5 and is seen as the first step towards ‘version 2.0’ of the platform, which will arrive next year.The new system moves the Ethereum blockchain towards the proof-of-stake system like Cardano and reduces not only its environmental footprint but also the transaction fees required on the network. Ether’s price — the cryptocurrency which fuels the Ethereum blockchain — has risen from around $2,700 on August 5 to $3,200 on September 12, whereas Cardano’s price remains around the $2 mark.“It’s only just the beginning. But this is still a moment for celebration. As a community, we have been on an incredible journey together. Rightly, we should allow ourselves to acknowledge the tremendous efforts made by so many to get here. This will also be a time for reflection on the challenges we've collectively overcome,” wrote Tim Harrison, Marketing and Communications Director of Input Output Global, the creators of Cardano, in a blog post.While Cardano’s price may be a fraction of what Ethereum costs right now, the cryptocurrency has been reaching its own highs. The market cap for ADA, Cardano’s native token, has almost doubled over the past month. On August 31, the token defied crash predictions to rise to an all time high of $2.56 — providing investors with over 150% returns.As mentioned before, introducing smart contracts makes the Cardano blockchain more flexible and useful, which in turn means it will have more usage. Which is one of the main reasons why many in the blockchain and DeFi world picked Ethereum over Bitcoin in the first place.Harrison warned that while the expectations from Alonzo are high, some may be unreasonable. “Cardano watchers may be expecting a sophisticated ecosystem of consumer-ready DApps available immediately after the upgrade. Expectations need to be managed here. We should remember that another well-known blockchain project which launched in July 2015 had to wait over two years before its first DApp (something to do with cats?) gained real user traction,” he wrote, referencing Cryptokitties, which was the first DApp built on the Ethereum blockchain.

2021-09-13,RT,India looks to tax cryptocurrency exchanges and trades – report,https://www.rt.com/business/534674-india-crypto-trade-tax/,"The authorities in India are considering taxing cryptocurrency trades and ecosystem in the country, news website ET Now reported on Monday, citing its sources.

According to people familiar with the matter, the government feels that an activity that generates income should be taxed. The country’s tax department favors taxing cryptocurrency exchange and trades, but that doesn’t mean that they would be categorized as a valid asset class, the media said.

Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Rama Subramaniam Gandhi said last week that cryptocurrencies must be regulated as an asset or commodity in India and governed by existing laws. He added that regulators should be aware of an individual’s crypto investments from a tax perspective and that such information should be shared with exchanges.

Also on rt.com India ranks 2nd in the world in cryptocurrency adoption – report

A recent study from market research firm Finder showed India ranked second in the world in terms of crypto adoption, with 30% of individuals polled saying they hold cryptocurrencies.

According to the report, in India, bitcoin is the most popular coin to own (16%), followed by ripple (8%), ethereum (6%) and bitcoin cash (6%). Despite the steps taken by the Indian government to severely restrict digital assets, cryptocurrency investments in the country increased from $923 million in April 2020 to almost $6.6 billion by May 2021.

The oldest cryptocurrency in the market, Bitcoin is an investor favourite. Other than the fact that it’s been around for the longest time — which isn’t really that long considering that it was launched just over a decade ago — investors like Bitcoin because it’s the biggest bull on the block. Simply put, it has the most value.

It was made with decentralised blockchain and stable supply in mind. A large community tries to hold it true to its root and continues to fine-tune it to minimise vulnerabilities. An extensive infrastructure has formed around Bitcoin — from its formation or ‘mining’, to trading, to validating transactions made using Bitcoin.

Right now, Bitcoin as a whole is worth $843 billion — more than double the value of the second runner up, Ethereum, which has a market cap of $386 billion at the time of publishing, according to CoinMarketCap.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/86163921/Beyond-Bitcoin-Stablecoins-altcoins-DApps-and-other-types-of-cryptocurrencies-that-want-to-be-more-than-just-digital-cash.jpg',)",none

2021-09-13,Mint,Bitcoin will consume a ‘Pakistan’ worth of electricity in 2021,https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-will-consume-a-pakistan-worth-of-electricity-in-2021-11631522070761.html,"The Bitcoin network was estimated to consume about 67TWh of electricity in 2020, and its total consumption has already surpassed this in 2021. By the end of this year, it looks set to have used 91TWh of energy - as much as Pakistan, according to a research report published by Bloomberg.

As the price of Bitcoin increases, more miners with less energy-efficient machines join the network, driving up energy use. This means that it is essential to improve the efficiency of crypto-mining and move to low-carbon energy sources for electricity.

Environmentalists have also warned that carbon emissions from power-intensive bitcoin mining could harm sustainability efforts.

In May, one of the most vocal proponents of cryptocurrencies, Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk said that the company has suspended the use of bitcoin to purchase its vehicles because of climate concerns.

Bitcoin mining is a process of creating a new coin that involves using computers to solve complex mathematical algorithms or puzzles. The cryptocurrencies are based on a decentralized network that need to be mined. The software that mines bitcoin is designed to take on average about 10 minutes for those on the network to solve the complex program and process a block.

The process ends up using a massive chunk of electricity as giant and powerful systems are used by miners to mine blocks and verify transactions. The vast majority of Bitcoin’s energy consumption happens during the mining process. As a reward for their services, miners receive newly created bitcoins along with transaction processing fees.

""With this agreement, the process of creating a common ultra-fine Copper powder marketplace, provided by blockchain-enabled cryptocurrency trading platform, has officially started,"" Mario Urlić, CEO and Cuprum Coin's founder, stated earlier this week. The company's goal is to ensure all investments in the marketplace are secured stores of value maintained for a long time. Due to the material costs and the incredibly difficult manufacturing process, ultra-fine copper powder is among the world's most valuable elements.

Positioned on its asset's uncompromised demand in the future, Cuprum Coin can maintain value for a long time. Although being based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), Cuprum Coin is a product that meets all the criteria of classic commodities, such as Copper, Gold, Silver, Aluminium, Cobalt, Zinc, Nickel etc. as well as traditional fiat currencies. Besides, its application will be wide, from the exchange of goods, crypto and fiat currencies, services, and much more.

Cuprum Coin is built on TEZOS, an ideal alternative platform for building eco-friendly blockchain applications as its Proof-of-Stake requires significantly less energy and cost to operate unlike Proof-of-Work blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

The demand for ultra-fine copper powder in the years to come will stay uncompromised, with expected price growth in the range between 8-12 percent. Its primary use is in the aerospace industry and space programs, as well as in medicine. Ultra-fine copper powder is used as the collateral for loans and often ends up in bank vaults, but as it is not classified as a commodity or financial instrument, retail traders, investors, investment firms, hedge, and pension funds are prohibited from trading with it. This is why Cuprum Coin is a perfect solution. The international team of experts is an additional guarantee for long-term success.

2021-09-13,Coingape,Breaking: Indian Government Favors Taxing Cryptocurrency Over Ban,https://coingape.com/breaking-indian-government-favors-taxing-cryptocurrency-over-ban/,"The Indian cryptocurrency ecosystem breathed a sigh of relief on Monday, as an ET report claimed that the government authorities might tax crypto transactions and exchanges in the near future. Insider sources told the publication that the tax department favors taxation instead of an outright ban. However, the taxation of crypto assets won’t make it an asset class.

“The tax department favors taxing cryptocurrency exchanges and trades in the country. But, it doesn’t mean that they would be categorized as a valid asset class.”

The recent reports came as a sigh of relief for the Indian crypto ecosystem as they have been in the dark about regulations for quite some time now. The report also contrasts recent comments made by the governor of the Indian Central Bank-RBI, Mr. Shaktikanta Das who has claimed that crypto-asset poses major concerns. Das has said,

“We have major concerns on cryptocurrency, which we have conveyed to the government. With regard to advice to investors, well, central banks don’t give any investment advice. It’s up to each investor to make his own appraisal, to do his own due diligence and take a very careful call with regard to his own investments.”

Former Deputy Governor Says India Must Treat Crypto as an Asset Class

While the current RBI governor has raised alarms regarding crypto legalization, the former deputy governor of the central bank R. Gandhi has quite a different take. Gandi said during a recent interview that India must treat cryptocurrencies as an asset class or commodity and bring it under existing exchange laws. He emphasized once crypto becomes mainstream it could be used for paying goods and services.

Despite the uncertainty around crypto regulations, the Indian crypto ecosystem has thrived to new highs. A recent chainalysis report claimed that India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption. While another report a few months earlier had claimed that the crypto investment of Indians rose nearly 20,000% last year. Indian crypto platforms have seen a great burst in adoption during peak bull season in the first quarter and the likes of CoinDCX closed a successful funding round to enter the crypto unicorn club.

2021-09-13,Yahoo Finance,Singapore bank DBS charts ambitious plans for digital exchange,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/singapore-bank-dbs-charts-ambitious-080739699.html,"FILE PHOTO: A logo of DBS is pictured outside an office in Singapore

By Anshuman Daga

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's DBS Group expects to double the number of members on its new platform for cryptocurrency trading to 1,000 by end-December and grow this by 20-30% annually for the next three years as digital tokens gain acceptability.

In an interview, DBS's senior executives said DBS Digital Exchange, set up in December as a members-only bourse, is seeing robust demand from corporate investors, accredited individuals and investment firms that manage the fortunes of wealthy families.

""We are growing very rapidly. Investors are gradually exploring cryptocurrencies and digital assets,"" said Eng-Kwok Seat Moey, head of capital markets at DBS, Southeast Asia's largest bank by assets, and chairperson of the exchange.

DBS's foray in the crypto business come after its CEO Piyush Gupta steered the bank to invest billions of dollars to upgrade its technology infrastructure over the past eight years as it embraced cloud computing and digitised its services.

DBS Digital Exchange bills itself as the world's only bank-backed full service digital bourse - offering cryptocurrency trading, asset tokenisation and digital custody services, in a crypto sector where investor trust is still low.

Soaring popularity of cryptocurrencies has posed a problem for mainstream banks as they try and balance clients' interest in digital coins with regulatory concerns about their risks.

A unit of Standard Chartered is setting up a joint venture https://www.reuters.com/technology/stanchart-unit-launch-cryptocurrency-trading-venture-2021-06-02 to establish a cryptocurrency brokerage and exchange platform in Britain and Europe, while HSBC said it has no plans to offer digital currencies to customers https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-hsbc-ceo-says-bitcoin-not-us-2021-05-24.

Eng-Kwok said DBS' position as one of the biggest wealth managers in Asia and its expertise in originating deals in capital markets would help it attract users and grow trading volume.

Story continues

The move comes at a time when DBS, like other banks, is looking to boost fee-based income as net interest income decreases amid low interest rates.

Eng-Kwok said the bourse hopes to list at least half a dozen security tokens by end-2022.

Singapore's central bank brought crypto businesses under a new regulatory framework that came into effect in January 2020.

DBS' brokerage arm has received an-principle approval under the new regime, which will allow it to directly support asset managers and companies to trade in digital payment tokens through the bourse. The Singapore Exchange has a 10% stake in the bourse.

""Having mainstream banks helps foster an environment where settlement risk is minimal and there are safeguards in place for custody of user deposits and security of transactions,"" said Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School in Britain.

Last week, Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said it will restrict its services in Singapore https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/binance-removes-singapore-products-main-platform-after-regulators-warning-2021-09-06 days after the central bank told it to stop offering payment services.

DBS Digital Exchange offers trading services between bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and XRP, and U.S., Singapore, Hong Kong dollars and the yen.

""Our aim was to create a platform that could serve the entire digital asset value chain, from deal origination to tokenisation, listing, trading, and custody – all within a trusted and regulated bank franchise,"" said Kwee Juan Han, DBS' group head of strategy and planning.

Han said a trend of companies exploring fundraising options through tokenised assets, and growing interest by private investors to expand the share of digital assets in portfolios offered DBS a timely opportunity to launch the bourse.

He said DBS expects its new businesses, including the digital exchange and a carbon exchange to bring in total revenue of S$350 million ($260 million) by the end of next year.

William Quigley, a co-founder of stablecoin “Tether” and a pioneer in the cryptocurrency space, sees the metaverse as a huge economic force that's going to change people's lives significantly in coming years.

Mr Quigley is a co-founder of the Worldwide Asset eXchange or WAX, a carbon-neutral proof-of-stake blockchain that specialises in areas like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and video games. The metaverse, a vision of an internet-enabled virtual world where people have avatars and interact with digital assets and even corporeal objects with augmented reality, is developing rapidly as blockchain technology evolves.

Mr Quigley spoke to Bloomberg News about NFTs, the metaverse and more in an interview. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.

What do you think of the growth in NFTs?

The whole market is driven by the value of Ethereum, which in March 2020 was under $100. Now it's $3,500. It's like everybody just got paid their annual salary, it's sitting in their pocket and they just arrived in Vegas. They're going to waste some of their money.

But don't be fooled. This is not a mass-market phenomenon. I suspect there aren't that many traditional art buyers who have abandoned the Rembrandt and are buying the Crypto Punk. I think it's mostly crypto rich.

From a consumer-product standpoint, what's interesting to me is not one NFT selling for $1 million, but a million NFTs being sold at $1 each. A brand-new business for digital collectibles. That seems to me to have longer legs and overall a bigger market.

How about the metaverse?

When we are able to have a digital overlay of our reality, it's going to be a massive change in business models, a massive change in the way we interact with each other and the world.

When it happens, it really is hard to imagine and hard to overstate the impact. I'm betting that the revenue model for the metaverse is going to be NFTs.

In video gaming the revenue model now is virtual items, and that's a $175 billion business annually. I think the metaverse should be orders of magnitude more than that because it's everything, it's not just gaming.

Some top altcoins have soared recently. Any thoughts on that?

So something is percolating for a while. And then for reasons I never understand, attention focuses on it and suddenly people pile in. That's the speculative aspect of this.

I've been doing this for a long time. Doing fundamental analysis on something like that is very, very hard – because there's no real reason. It becomes part of the zeitgeist. And people are excited about it, and it goes up.

Elon Musk & Dogecoin

Created in 2013, Dogecoin came into existence as a joke centred around a meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. The celebrity businessmen is known for openly supporting Dogecoin which has over time built a strong community of followers. Musk had earlier admitted that he was impressed with the coin’s 8,000% gain over the last year. He is also fondly dubbed by his fans as 'Dogefather'.

Eager to see the Shiba Inu's arrival, netizens congratulated Elon Musk and shared a storm of memes for their 'Dogefeather', a term which had now become reality. A netizen even asked for a picture of Floki and Marvin (Musk's other dog) together, however, the tech billionaire revealed that they weren't friends yet.

2021-09-13,Finance Magnates,"XRP Beats Market Cap of Solana, Regains 6th Spot",https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/xrp-beats-market-cap-of-solana-regains-6th-spot/,"XRP has regained the title as the world’s 6th most valuable cryptocurrency just 4 days after losing its place to Solana (SOL). According to Coinmarketcap, XRP’s market cap jumped above $50 billion on Monday.

Last week, Solana touched the market cap of $60 billion and became the world’s 6th largest digital asset. However, SOL has crashed by more than 20% in the last three days as its market cap dropped below $47 billion. In contrast, XRP remained stable during the mentioned period and its price stayed above $1.05.

The overall address activity of XRP increased sharply last week nearing the price level of $1.10. According to Santiment, the number of unique XRP addresses spiked substantially over the last few days amid a surge in demand from retail investors.

On 7 September 2021, the total market capitalization of XRP crossed $70 billion for the first time since May 2021. Although, the latest crypto market correction caused a sharp drop in its price as the digital asset dipped by more than 15% in the last five days. In terms of market cap, XRP is more valuable than Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK) and Uniswap (UNI).

XRP’s Market Dominance

With a market cap of approximately $50 billion, XRP accounts for more than 2% of the total market capitalization of digital currencies. The overall market cap of crypto assets currently stands at around $2 trillion, which is a drop of $200 billion in the last seven days. XRP is now eyeing the market dominance and market cap of Binance Coin (BNB), the world’s 5th most valuable digital currency. Presently, BNB has a market cap of over $67 billion and a market dominance of nearly 2.5%.

According to Whale Alert, a leading blockchain tracking and analytics platform, a crypto whale address moved 20 million XRP coins worth nearly $22 million from an unknown digital wallet to Bitso exchange. The mentioned transfer was executed on Sunday 12 September 2021 at 22:43 UTC.","('https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/XRP.jpg',)",none
2021-09-13,News18,"RBI Lost Case on Cryptocurrency in Supreme Court, It Must Stop Behaving Like Sore Loser",https://www.news18.com/news/opinion/rbi-lost-case-on-cryptocurrency-in-supreme-court-it-must-stop-behaving-like-sore-loser-4196594.html,"Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das recently said that the RBI has conveyed its “serious and major concerns” over virtual currencies (VCs) to the government. The so-called concerns over cryptocurrency are misplaced at best and smack of the central bank’s statist approach at worst.

On March 4, 2020, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court had quashed the ban that the RBI had imposed on trading in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in April 2018.

On May 31 this year, the RBI had directed banks not to cite its 2018 ban as a reason to deny banking services to customers dealing in cryptocurrency. “It has come to our attention through media reports that certain banks/regulated entities have cautioned their customers against dealing in virtual currencies” by making a reference to the ban it had imposed, an RBI circular said.

So, it took almost a year for the RBI to realize, and that too from media reports, that the entities regulated by it still regarded virtual currencies as proscribed. This is surely not a mark of the banking regulator’s efficiency.

It directed the banks that following the apex court order, the earlier circular proscribing virtual currencies was no longer valid. The circular went on to add, “Banks, as well as other entities addressed above, may, however, continue to carry out customer due diligence processes in line with regulations governing standards for Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and obligations of regulated entities under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, (PMLA), 2002, in addition to ensuring compliance with relevant provisions under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) for overseas remittances.”

Banks continued to caution their customers against dealing in cryptocurrencies because the RBI, despite the SC verdict, has persistently campaigned against the innovation. In the last week of February this year, Das raised concerns over VCs. The next month he again said the RBI had major concerns. Then again in June. His opposition to cryptocurrency seems to be the zeal of an activist rather than the reservation of a statutory regulator regarding an issue.

So, the RBI remains hostile towards and suspicious of cryptocurrencies, which are digitally encrypted, decentralized, and not regulated by any central bank or government. Right from the beginning of cryptocurrencies in the 1980s, its votaries were anti-establishment activists whose distrust of central banks as well as governments was libertarian-like.

As one of them, Adam Back, wrote: “What we want is fully anonymous, ultra-low transaction cost, transferable units of exchange. If we get that going … the banks will become the obsolete dinosaurs they deserve to become.”

The parent of the first successful cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is a mysterious, unknown figure by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. He is said to have sent an e-mail in August 2008 to Adam Back, along with an attachment, a white paper.

According to Satoshi, “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”

He and other cryptocurrency enthusiasts overcame the problem by bypassing all central banks and governments. Bitcoin was born and became hugely successful, attracting billions of dollars in the last few years.

Yet, as evident from Das’ recent salvo at virtual currencies, the central bank is unwilling to accept this development. This does not show him and the RBI in a good light; the central bank starts looking like a Luddite, instinctively hostile to innovation. And like a control freak that can’t accept anything it can’t control (the government’s approach was similar to that of the RBI. It once planned a law to ban VCs). This is not much different from the Chinese attitude. It may be noted that China proscribes VCs.

On the other hand, many major democracies, such as the US, Canada and the UK, allow the use of Bitcoin. Even the tiny Latin American nation El Salvador with a population of 6.5 million, recently accepted Bitcoin as legal tender.

It is not that the RBI has nothing important to do. “Gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) on retail and MSME loan books of public sector banks rose to 7.28 per cent in June 2021 from about 6 per cent a year ago. The incidence of bad loans was lower for private banks with GNPAs at 3.32 per cent in June, up from 2.01 per cent year ago, according to CARE Ratings,” says a Business Standard report.

Another report in The Indian Express says, “Public sector banks are experiencing a sharp surge in the proportion of Mudra loans turning into non-performing assets (NPAs) following the impact of COVID on incomes and repayment capacity of borrowers, according to bankers and an analysis of available data from state-level bankers’ committees.”

These developments are not surprising, given the devastation the coronavirus has occasioned.

Then there is the issue of bank privatization, something urgently needed but, if it happens, will be hugely controversial. The good news is that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has made her government’s intentions clear over the subject. A couple of weeks ago, she said, “During the budget, a public enterprise policy was announced, wherein we had identified certain strategically important sectors and in them, the bare minimum presence of the government will be there. Banks, financial institutions, and insurance are identified as strategic sectors, which means the government’s minimum presence will be there in insurance.”

It would be worth its while if the RBI works in tandem with the government to smoothen the process of bank privatization.

Then there is a great deal that India has to do in the realm of financial inclusion. The recently unveiled RBI’s annual Financial Inclusion (FI) Index shows the country at 53.9, where 100 is the full financial inclusion score.

The RBI should focus on such urgent matters instead of crying like a bad loser on the issue of cryptocurrency.

Ethereum failed to clear the $3,450 level and started a fresh decline.

The price is now trading well below $3,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

The pair could extend its decline if there is a clear break below the $3,200 support zone.

Ethereum Price is Struggling Below $3,400

Ethereum attempted a recovery wave above the $3,400 level. However, ETH struggled to clear the $3,450 resistance and it even failed to stay above the 100 hourly simple moving average.

A high was formed near $3,450 and the price started a fresh decline, similar to bitcoin. There was a break below the $3,350 and $3,320 support levels. Ether traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,148 swing low to $3,450 high.

It is now trading well below $3,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Besides, it is now trading well below $3,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $3,320 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,380 level. A proper move above the $3,380 level and $3,400 could increase the chances of a steady increase. The next major resistance sits near $3,500.

More Losses in ETH?

If ethereum fails to continue higher above the $3,350 and $3,400 resistance levels, it could start another downward move. An immediate support on the downside is near the $3,220 level.

The 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,148 swing low to $3,450 high is also near $3,220. A downside break below the $3,220 and $3,200 support levels might push the price further lower. The next major support is now forming near the $3,150 zone, below which ether price might revisit $3,000.

Leading US stock exchange Nasdaq will now provide data services and price feeds to DeFiChain, Bloomberg reports. DeFiChain, built on the Bitcoin network, is a native decentralized finance blockchain dedicated to monetary applications and services.Feeds can update real-time market data in fraction of a second with extremely-low latency, ensuring real-time uploading of data. DeFiChain will offer tokenized stocks that are linked to the underlying prices of companies such as Apple Amazon .com,Tesla Inc. Besides Nasdaq, Finnhub and Tiingo are also providing price feeds and data services to DeFiChain’s tokenized stocks. Finnhub is an Annual Percentage Yield provider for stock, forex and crypto markets while Tiingo, is a financial data platform that provides price feed services.The value of tokenized stocks will be determined by the value of an underlying asset like traditionally traded equity with which it is collateralized. In the case of DeFiChain, cryptocurrencies will be collaterals that will be pegged to the underlying price of exchange- listed firms like Apple, Amazon etc. The process will eliminate the need for intermediaries or agents.Tokenized stocks can be purchased in the form of decentralized loans in a fraction of a second. Tokens are a small part of the stocks that can be bought on DeFiChain, without purchasing whole shares. The shares in DeFi will be represented over a smart contract recorded and executed on the Bitcoin blockchain network unlike physical certificates in case of traditional stock trading.The price feed mechanism of Nasdaq will use both DeFiChain’s native digital currency, DFI coin, and other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and USD coin. USD coin is a stablecoin pegged to the dollar.A tokenized stock trading does not give ownership of the underlying asset. Instead, it is the representation of a stock in the form of tokens. DeFiChain tokens can be traded 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. The co-founder of DeFiChain Julian Hosp was quoted as saying in cointelegraph that the collaboration would provide big relief to those fed up with the traditional stock market and looking for newer avenues of trading.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-86159993,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-134338,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

What Is Stablecoin, That Has Attracted US Govt's Attention",https://www.news18.com/news/explainers/explained-a-cryptocurrency-for-everyday-use-what-is-stablecoin-that-has-attracted-us-govts-attention-4196684.html,"Reports last week said that US Treasury Department officials met industry players to ascertain the risks and prospects posed by stablecoins, a variety of cryptocurrency that is nonetheless very different from the likes of Bitcoin. The stablecoin market is already worth more about $125 billion and US officials are looking to bring them under a regulatory framework. Here’s all you need to know.

What Is A Stablecoin?

The value of one Bitcoin — the first cryptocurrency — in mid-September 2021 is close to Rs 39 lakh, and it’s subject to wild fluctuations given that it is a speculative asset that has captured the imagination of digital enthusiasts the world over. Spending Bitcoins, therefore, is a tricky business. A rise in its value after spenders use it for a transaction may leave them regretting their losses.

The volatility in value thus remains a key reason why Bitcoins, and other cryptocurrencies, are seen as being less reliable than fiat, or normal, government-issued currency even though there are many advantages that they provide over traditional currencies, like instant transactions and the absence of any requirement to rely on a third-party verifier, like a bank, to validate transactions. Stablecoins combine the best of both worlds by addressing the volatility issues while providing the same digital advantage in transactions.

Basically, thus, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is linked to another asset class — say, a fiat currency like the US dollar, precious metals like gold or silver, etc.

How Does It Work?

According to Coinbase, which runs a stablecoin called USDC, “the combination of traditional-asset stability with digital-asset flexibility has proven to be a wildly popular idea"" and it has proven to be a “form of digital money that is better suited to everything from day-to-day commerce to making transfers between exchanges"".

As already discussed, the stability derives from the state of being pegged to a reserve asset, like the US dollar, the euro, or the Japanese yen. The more popular stablecoins, like Tether, TrueUSD, etc. are what are described as fiat-collaterised currencies. That is, they are backed by dollar deposits held by the firm issuing the stablecoin. One stablecoin is worth one USD and the firm usually keeps audited reserves of US dollars to be able to cover all the stablecoin issued by it. So, if there is $1 million value of a particular stablecoin in circulation, its creator would need to hold $1 million in US dollars.

But there can be stablecoins that are pegged to another cryptocurrency or even to an algorithm, the latter known as non-collaterised stablecoins. As for the ones collaterised to another cryptocurrency, you may want to ask how they remain free of volatility. What these stablecoins do is usually embrace something called over-collateralisation. That is, they hold more of the cryptocurrency to which they are pegged than the stablecoins they issue. Which would mean, say, that they issue a stablecoin valued at $1 for every $2-3 they hold in cryptocurrency, the extra value acting as a buffer against price fluctuations.

What Are The Benefits?

Cryptocurrencies arose with an aim of making banking decentralised and expanding the reach and ease of spending money. However, the likes of Bitcoin and Ether have become more popular as an asset than tokens that people can actually spend, mainly due to their constantly fluctuating value. By being anchored to a stable currency like the USD — which is monitored by a central bank that can take steps to keep its value from witnessing wild swings — stablecoins offer a more reliable avenue of digital transactions.

Coinbase says that the advantages of stablecoins range from the lack of a need to have a bank account to undertake transactions to the ease of transferring money anywhere on Earth quckly and at a minute fraction of what it would cost via traditional banking and financial channels.

“Stablecoins’ value can be sent easily around the globe, including to places where the US dollar may be hard to obtain or where the local currency is unstable,"" says Coinbase, adding that “people have sent as much as a million dollars worth of USDC with transfer fees of less than a dollar"".

Why Are US Officials Examining Stablecoins?

Stablecoins, like all cryptocurrencies, are seen as having the potential to improve financial inclusivity and bring down transaction costs and fees involved with the use of traditional banking systems. Everything from accessing loans to making transactions anfd sending and receiving money can be sped and reimagined with cryptocurrencies. But authorities also fear that given their very nature, cryptocurrencies — that are run by private firms — can contribute to amplifying systemic risks, promoting financial crime, and hurting investors.

When it comes to stablecoins, reports said that US officials engaged with the industry players to understand the need for oversight and also analysed what it would mean if a lot of users simultaneously sought to convert their stablecoins back to US dollars. Further, with many countries planning to launch their own central bank-backed digital currencies — including the Reserve Bank of India — there are ramifications vis-a-vis stablecoins that officials would be keen to assess.

A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum fall to an early morning intraday low $3,231.75 before making a move.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $3,195, Ethereum rallied to a mid-day intraday high $3,472.99.

Ethereum broke through the first major resistance level at $3,344 and the second major resistance level at $3,422.

The rally also saw Ethereum break through the 23.6% FIB of $3,369 before briefly falling back to sub-$3,310 levels.

For the day ahead

Ethereum would need to avoid the $3,370 pivot and the 23.6% FIB of $3,369 to bring the first major resistance level at $3,507 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $3,500 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap the upside.

Bitcoin price

After an upside correction, bitcoin price failed to stay above the USD 46,500 level. As a result, BTC started a fresh decline and it broke the USD 45,500 support zone. There was also a break below the USD 45,000 support zone. If the bears remain in action, the price could continue to move down towards USD 44,200. The next major support could be USD 43,000 or USD 42,500.

An immediate resistance on the upside is near the USD 45,800. The first major resistance is near the USD 46,000 level. The main weekly resistance is now forming near the USD 47,000 level.

Ethereum price

Ethereum price started another decline below the USD 3,400 support. ETH broke the USD 3,350 and USD 3,300 levels. It is now approaching the USD 3,250 support. If there is a downside break below USD 3,250, the price could decline towards the USD 3,000 level.

Taking to Twitter, Musk tweeted a picture of his pet Shiba Inu with the caption 'Floki has arrived'.

When asked by a Twitter user if Musk can post pictures of Floki with his other pet dog, Marvin, the Tesla CEO said that they are not friends yet.

2021-09-13,Bitcoin News,Today's Cryptocurrency Data Aggregators Offer a Plethora of Onchain and Market Insights – Featured Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/todays-cryptocurrency-data-aggregators-offer-a-plethora-of-onchain-and-market-insights/,"Today's Cryptocurrency Data Aggregators Offer a Plethora of Onchain and Market Insights

In the early days, there were only a few web portals with cryptocurrency statistics and data tied to these ever-changing digital asset markets and blockchain metrics. More than ten years later, however, data and analytics tethered to the world’s most popular and most used digital currencies have swelled with growth. The following article delves into a myriad of web portals that offer insights into the innovative land of cryptocurrencies.

Charts, Onchain Metrics, and Coin Market Cap Aggregation

Over a decade ago, there were a couple of websites that shared information concerning bitcoin (BTC) and the small number of digital assets that traded beside BTC in the early days. A few websites displayed BTC’s price and a handful of onchain statistics, so people could get a sense of crypto markets and the utility of these blockchains. Web portals in the early days consisted of price chart pages like zeroblock.com, onchain metrics from blockchain.info (now blockchain.com), and crypto coin market aggregators like coinmarketcap.com.

Now with more than 10,000 crypto assets worth around $2.21 trillion on September 12, 2021, there’s a plethora of data and analytical websites that help guide crypto supporters with various forms of insight. Coinmarketcap.com has a number of competitors now such as coingecko.com, coincap.io, markets.bitcoin.com, and messari.io. All of them are very different and they each give a contrasting perspective on crypto coin market cap aggregation, alongside insights into different kinds of market data. Coingecko.com and messari.io, for instance, show metrics like percentages for crypto coins over 24 hours, one week, two weeks, 30 days, 90 days, and year-to-date.

Markets.bitcoin.com offers a unique perspective of coin market caps and individual insights to different coins with professional tradingview.com charts. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency market aggregator from Bitcoin.com also shows token summaries stemming from intotheblock.com. The portal coincap.io is similar to markets.bitcoin.com and coingecko.com, as it shows an aggregated list of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Coincap.io is also interesting because visitors can swap tokens by connecting a decentralized finance (defi) wallet like Metamask, Portis, Torus, and the Coinbase Wallet.

Track, Compare, Access Important Ecosystem Platforms

Another website that helps users explore cryptocurrency markets is coinread.com, which offers insight into 1,752 cryptocurrencies and metrics from more than 100 crypto exchanges. Coinread.com provides a few distinct methods to look at key metrics like rank, volume, circulating supplies, and the top exchanges where these digital currencies are traded the most. Users can compare different crypto assets to view price movements in a chart showing a myriad of choices.

Further, coinread.com users can track different coins and follow the market changes tied to the user’s portfolio. Individual crypto assets are broken down into different time intervals, like one hour, 24 hours, seven-day, one month, and annual changes. Users can view an individual crypto asset to get a description of the token, alongside important information like the project’s website, white paper, source code, blockchain explorers, social media links, and forums.

All of these web portals offer different perspectives when it comes to the vast land of crypto assets and there are many more helpful websites to keep you informed. Defillama.com, for instance, is a defi dashboard that shows the aggregate total value locked in defi applications across multiple blockchains. Users can get further insights on crypto derivatives markets like options, futures, and perpetual swaps from the web portals skew.com and bit.com as well.

Dune Analytics offers insights to onchain Ethereum data, ether-based products and market statistics tied to things like defi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized exchange (dex) platforms. Dappradar.com also shows a plethora of factoids and market stats tethered to defi, NFTs, and NFT markets.

The aforementioned list of web portals that inform crypto investors barely scratches the surface when it comes to data sites and analytical products. The best part, however, is that all of these crypto applications are free to use even though some of the sites offer more tracking depth for paid subscribers.

2021-09-13,NDTV.com,Know About Fees Levied By Online Exchanges For Bitcoin Transactions,https://www.ndtv.com/business/want-to-buy-bitcoin-these-are-some-fees-that-you-should-know-2536490,"Exchanges allow users to create their own digital wallets to keep the cryptocurrency safe

Being the most popular cryptocurrency, people tend to invest in Bitcoin. Also, since it's the oldest crypto coin, it commands more credibility in the volatile industry than those which came later. There are mainly two ways in which Bitcoin trading is done. One is through “mining” and the other by purchasing Bitcoins from an online exchange. Mining is a complex job involving deep familiarity with the technology and the skill set to solve complex mathematical equations. But trading it through an exchange is less cumbersome. However, a user is required to pay some fees to be able to trade via an exchange.

Transaction fee

All exchanges charge this fee, their primary source of income for facilitating a buy or sell transaction. Most of the exchanges follow a fixed fee model, that is they charge a predetermined amount for facilitating each transaction. Still, the final commission paid to an exchange may vary depending on the volume of transaction and other exchange-specific factors. Bitcoin investors should do research about different exchanges and pick the one that suits their interest best.

Another model some exchanges follow is the Maker-Taker model. This is a variable fee model in which the seller is the maker and the buyer is the taker. The transaction fee depends on the amount traded and the trading frequency of a user. For example, if you are an active trader, you could qualify as a maker and pay a reduced transaction fee.

Wallet fee

Exchanges allow users to create their own digital wallets to keep the cryptocurrency safe. Most wallets don't charge a fee for storing the coins but withdrawing or depositing coins may invite a charge.

Network fee

The network fee is used to pay miners for verifying transactions so that they can be added to the blockchain (or the decentralised ledger) and the process is complete. Miners are an important part of the transaction process and they invest in powerful computers to do their job. They ensure the transparency and legitimacy of transactions. The cryptocurrency exchange has no direct control over network fees, which follows the concept of demand and supply. If the transaction is high, this fee will increase.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/l0hnvk08_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none

The biggest virtual currency touched an all-time high in June and reached $65,000- triggered by some favourable developments across the world. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s rival Ethereum also opened in the positive territory at $3,283.92, down 0.07 per cent.

“The crypto market showed signs of stability entering the new week. Most crypto traders and investors would be looking forward to putting the volatility of the previous week behind them. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin found support near the $45,500 mark. The largest Altcoin, Ether showed strong character above $3400. This new week would be crucial for the two heavyweights in crypto. The past 24 hours were tough for Solana as it tanked over 6%. After an intense rally over the past week or so, Solana could likely be entering a consolidation zone soon. The global crypto market cap stood at $2.12 trillion, a marginal increase of 0.94% over the past 24 hours. The traded volumes dropped massively as traders remained watchful over the weekend. Bitcoin dominance also took a marginal dip, although the overall market capitalization increased riding on the back of an Altcoin rally,"" Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder, Mudrex- A Global Crypto Trading Platform said.

Last week, Shaktikant Das, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India at an event organized by The Indian Express and Financial Times, said that the central bank continues to have ‘serious and major’ concerns regarding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. He also said that this concern was conveyed to the government of India.

Currently, the global crypto market cap is $2.07 trillion, a 0.25 per cent increase over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $110.17 billion which makes a 0.49 per cent decrease. The total volume in DeFi is currently $18.22 billion, 16.54 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins is now $85.17 billion, which is 77.31 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. However, Bitcoin’s dominance took a beating by 0.13 per cent at 41.10 per cent.

“The overall crypto market cap recently touched $2.4 trillion since its upward trend from the 3rd week of July in a likely rising channel pattern.

2021-09-13,iTnews,"Cryptocurrency business dealings scare NAB, Westpac",https://www.itnews.com.au/news/cryptocurrency-business-dealings-scare-nab-westpac-569680,"NAB and Westpac have rejected claims they are hindering competition in the Australian finance landscape by declining banking opportunities with cryptocurrency businesses, putting their hesitancy down to the need to manage risk.

Both banks fronted a parliamentary committee late last week to answer questions on various practices including the decision to ‘debank’ or refuse banking services to cryptocurrency businesses.

The pair said digital currencies posed significant risks due to the uncertainly surrounding the technology, leaving them with no choice but to opt-out of dealing with such businesses.

NAB chief executive Ross McEwan dismissed senator Jason Falinski’s claim that refusal of banking services provision amount to anti-competitive behaviour, citing the many unknowns around the accountabilities and practicalities of cryptocurrency-based companies.

“One of the things that underlines a bank is we have to manage risk. That's what we do all day every day,” McEwan said.

“Could you tell me the future of cryptocurrency? Could you tell me what the risk is if I allow it to come in? What liability do I wear for something that goes wrong?”

McEwan described the bank's relationship with the cryptocurrency sector as an “emerging issue”, and said it was still unsure where digital currencies fitted in the financial landscape.

“We'd have to look at where does cryptocurrency go along with a number of parties like the Reserve Bank and regulators,” he said.

“We need a seriously good look at what is the role, if there is a role for cryptocurrency, or any other form of money movement.”

McEwan added that dealing with cryptocurrency businesses “is fine until it goes wrong”.

“I'm worried about understanding [what cryptocurrency] is and [what] are the true ramifications long term and if we can get it safely [to the] customer we may or may not trade cryptocurrencies,” he said.

NAB is currently reviewing the broader application of cryptocurrency and is studying how customer preferences are evolving before fully developing its own strategy.

Westpac CEO Peter King said that “in relation to cryptocurrency, [the bank] can't get itself comfortable because it's anonymous money and therefore we can't meet the regulations”.

“We've looked at the requirements and what we would need to do and the cost of getting it wrong versus the return we get for it, and haven't got ourselves there on the risk-reward equation,” he said.

At present cryptocurrencies fail to meeting the bank's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism requirements, adding digital currencies have “features that are hard, and we haven't found a way through that yet.”

Westpac has already ‘debanked’ eight fintechs in the past year deeming them too high a risk to continue business with.

NAB chose not to disclose how many fintechs it no longer provides services to to the committee, stating the bank’s “decisions to exit the banking relationship with a fintech are informed by NAB's risk appetite.”

Despite NAB and Westpac's caution around cryptocurrencies, Macquarie Group recently partnered with Canadian blockchain technology company Blockstream to pilot a bitcoin mining facility in the hopes of developing alternative renewable energy options for mining virtual coins.

‘Mining’ is the process of creating new cryptocurrency for circulation and requires a vast amount of energy.","('https://i.nextmedia.com.au/News/bitcoin_scam.jpg',)",none
2021-09-13,News18,"Elon Musk Posts Photo of New Pet Shiba Inu, Dogecoin Cryptocurrency Value Jumps",https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/elon-musk-posts-photo-of-new-pet-shiba-inu-floki-dogecoin-baby-doge-cryptocurrencies-value-jumps-4196120.html,"Elon Musk is back at it again. Almost weeks after Musk made a direct comment about the cryptocurrency and its future, the ‘Musk Effect’ still appears to be going strong, especially with the Tesla boss and SpaceX CEO’s favorite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. Dogecoin started as a joke. In early 2021, however, the joke appears to have turned on those who didn’t take the meme cryptocurrency seriously. The meme-cryptocurrency Elon Musk wouldn’t stop tweeting about reached an all-time high in mid-April, crossing 10 cents for the first time. his is the highest-ever for the cryptocurrency, and the result of a semi-ironic movement that’s involved thousands of buyers, tens of thousands of online posters and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk. In early January, each token was worth less than one cent. In late January, when both the GameStop and DogeCoin movements hit their stride, the value of DogeCoin shot up to 7.5 cents, well over a 10-magnification, before sliding down to 2.5 cents.

While Musk has consistently stopped tweeting about the cryptocurrency, (which has also been met with a lot of backlash for people who blame Musk for investing their money in it, only to see it no longer rise) in end June he shared that he would be getting a pet Shiba Inu soon, and announced naming his Shiba Inu ‘Floki.’

In the early hours of September 13, Musk posted an update - a photo of his new puppy: Floki.

Floki has arrived pic.twitter.com/2MiUKb91FT— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 12, 2021

Following Musk’s tweet, Dogecoin recorded a +0.36% change in the last 24 hours, with the rise in value, coinciding with the same time Musk posted the tweet 3:50 AM (GMT +5:30).

Dogecoin was not the only cryptocurrency that jumped - Baby Doge Coin, a spinoff of Dogecoin, also recorded a +1.80% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap. Baby Doge is described as having ‘learned a few tricks and lessons from his meme father, Doge Coin. A Birthed by fans of the Doge community. Baby Doge seeks to impress his father by showing his new improved transaction speeds & adorableness. He is Hyper-deflationary with an integrated smart staking system built in so more baby doge are being added to your wallet. Simply Love, pet, and watch your baby doge grow.’

This is not the first time Musk has ‘accidentally’ led to the surge in prices of the cryptocurrency. It’s not even the second, or third time. Every time Musk mentions the cryptocurrency, a surge (often following an eventual downfall) occurs in the prices of the cryptocurrency. Dogecoin, much like Bitcoin, is a digital coin used for e-transactions. Doge is a reference to the ‘doge’ meme and has a picture of the shiba inu on it. It is a cryptocurrency, a form of digital money that, much like bitcoin, enables peer-to-peer transactions across a decentralized network.

Since its creation, Doge has also been used to donate money to charities. These have included the 2014 Jamaican Bobsled team who couldn’t afford to get to the Sochi Winter Olympics, a Nascar driver named Josh Wise, and a clean water project in Kenya called Doge4Water.

At the peak of the meme’s popularity in 2013, Palmer, an Australian marketer, made a joke combining two of the internet’s most talked-about topics: cryptocurrency and Doge. He bought the Dogecoin.com domain and uploaded a photoshopped Shibe on a coin.

“If you want to make Dogecoin a reality, get in touch,"" said the website. On the other side of the world, Billy Markus, a software engineer at IBM, got in touch and set Dogecoin live. Dogecoin soared up by more than 60 per cent over the last 24 hours and experienced a 1,421 per cent increase in trading volume according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.

The peak price of Dogecoin in 2018 was around two cents, right before it crashed along with the rest of cryptocurrency. Reports suggest that by early 2019, Dogecoin had lost nearly 90 per cent of its value and was trading for a fraction of a penny, until 2021.

Bitcoin experienced a flash crash last week as El Salvador’s rollout of the digital asset as legal tender appeared to be hit by technical difficulties. It fell as much as 17% that day, with the swiftness accelerating as some 336,000 traders had their accounts liquidated amid the decline.

El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, a development many crypto fans saw as potentially leading to greater adoption and mainstream acceptance.

Meanwhile, A Bloomberg report stated that US officials are discussing launching a formal review into whether Tether and other stablecoins threaten financial stability, scrutiny that could lead to dramatically ramped-up oversight for a fast-growing corner of the crypto market.

In addition, it’s a seasonally challenging period for the coin, in the past decade, September has been the only month when Bitcoin has failed to deliver positive returns. The token fell during the calendar month in six of the previous 10 years, losing more than 6% on average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

2021-09-13,DTNext,Decrypt: Cryptocurrency on an energy guzzling power trip,https://www.dtnext.in/News/Business/2021/09/13072541/1317760/Decrypt-Cryptocurrency-on-an-energy-guzzling-power-.vpf,"New Delhi :

The big question is whether we can make crypto sustainable? What if Bitcoin could be mined using more sources of renewable energy, likewind, solar or hydropower? It’s tricky to figure out exactly how much of Bitcoin mining is powered by renewables due to the very nature of Bitcoin: a decentralised currency whose miners are largely anonymous. Globally, estimates of Bitcoin’s use of renewables range from about 40 pc to almost 75 pc. Experts say, using renew-able energy to power Bitcoin mining means it won’t be available to power a home, a factory or an electric car.













FORK: When users of a blockchain make changes to its rules it is known as a Fork. These changes to the protocol of a blockchain may result in two new paths, one that follows the old rules, and a new blockchain that splits off from the previous one.





Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency is an unregulated digital asset and is subject to market risks



Even as the adoption of cryptocur-rency gains momentum, the sky-rocketing cost of energy required to maintain such networks has emerged as a major point of concern. To earn cryptocurrencies and ensure a stable reservoir of coins on the network, miners are required to solve cryptographic equations using high-end computers. The energy intensive process of cryptomining involves the verification of data blocks. These transaction records are in-turn added to a public ledger using blockchain technology.Consider this: the process of mining Bitcoin to spend or trade consumes around 91 terawatt hours of electricity annually, which is more than the quantum used by Finland, a nation of about 5.5 million. That usage, which amounts to half-a-per cent of all the global electricity consumed, has risen ten-fold in just the past five years. The Bitcoin network uses about the same amount of electricity annually as the state of Washington. It’s over a third of what residential cooling in the US uses up and over seven times as much electricity as all of Google’s global operations.Cryptocurrency networks require thousands of expensive hardware components to be housed in massive ware-houses with enough cooling power to keep the constantly running machinery from overheating. That’s why mining now happens in giant data centres owned by companies or groups of people. In fact, operations have consolidated to an extent where only seven mining groups own nearly 80 pc of all computing power on the network. In India, the cost of power consumption for crypto mining ranges from Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 a month. A cryptocurrency mining infrastructure could involve a spend of Rs 50,000 to Rs 4 lakh depending upon the complexity and use case requirements, as per a report.Mining happens all over the world, often wherever there’s an abundance of cheap energy. For years, Bitcoin mining was concentrated in China, although recently, the country has started cracking down. Researchers at the University of Cambridge who have been tracking Bitcoin mining said recently that China’s share of global Bitcoin mining had fallen to 46 pc in April from 75 pc in late 2019. Mean-while, the US’ share of mining grew to 16 pc from 4 pc during the same period. Crypto mining implies hardware piling up, too. Alex de Vries, a Parisian economist, estimates that every year and a half or so, the computational power of mining hardware doubles, making older machines obsolete. At the start of 2021, Bitcoin alone was generating more e-waste than many midsize countries, he says.Thankfully, India has been witnessing a rise in the number of con-scientious miners. Crypto miners in the country are hoping to keep power bills low by setting up solar rooftop power units and battery back-up in residential facilities. Some of them are even considering colder countries to set up their crypto infrastructurewhich would bring down heat-related issues and operating costs.","('https://img.dtnext.in/Articles/2021/Sep/202109130742327997_Decrypt-Cryptocurrency-on-an-energy-guzzling-power-trip_SECVPF.gif',)",none
2021-09-13,The Daily Californian,3 Reasons Why CoinSpot Should be on Your List of Top Cryptocurrency Exchanges,https://www.dailycal.org/2021/09/12/3-reasons-why-coinspot-should-be-on-your-list-of-top-cryptocurrency-exchanges/,"From the outside looking in, cryptocurrency exchanges might all look the same, but they can be very different from each other. They are not as tightly regulated as traditional exchanges, so doing your research is very important. Some may be safer than others while some might make it more difficult to make certain trades. But if there’s one exchange where you can feel confident trading, it’s CoinSpot. It’s one of the most popular exchanges in the country and it’s easy to see why when you start looking at the features. Here are three reasons why CoinSpot should be on the top of your list of crypto exchanges.

The Selection

Many people who first start investing in crypto assume that every coin there is on the market will be tradable on any exchange, but they might be surprised by how limited certain exchanges are. Some will only allow you to trade a handful of crypto. So, if you want to buy obscure altcoins with great potential, you might be disappointed.

The most popular cryptocurrency exchange in Australia (CoinSpot.com.au) has one of the largest offerings of crypto coins available for customers to trade. The exchange has over 300 different currencies you can trade, which is one of the largest out of any exchange in the world. It also allows you to exchange fiat money for cryptocurrency, which is not always possible with all exchanges.

Security

Security is another thing very few people think about when they buy cryptocurrency, but you shouldn’t assume that all exchanges are safe. It will all depend on the resources the exchange has and how much they care about keeping their users and their funds safe.

Exchanges have been hacked before, and there will be more attacks in the future. But that’s not something you’ll need to worry about with CoinSpot.

CoinSpot is one of the oldest exchanges in Australia and is one of the most secure as well. It is the only exchange to have ISO 27001 certification. This means that the exchange had to go through a gruelling investigation and ongoing information security management audits. Most of the assets are in high-security cold storage and they allow users to enable features like two-factor authentication, phone verification, and anti-phishing phrases for added security.

Other Points in Favour of CoinSpot

In addition to being one of the safest exchanges with the highest offering, there are many other reasons why CoinSpot is so great, especially for beginners. One of them is the easy-to-use interface. You’ll be able to pick it up in seconds and make withdrawals and deposit easily. Yet, it has all the features an advanced trader would expect from a platform.

Another thing that makes CoinSpot a great option is the customer service. They are truly dedicated to helping customers and are easily reachable either through live chat or phone, which could come in handy if you have issues with your account or an ongoing trade.

Conclusion

If you are looking for a safe, easy to use, cryptocurrency exchange with years of history, look no further than CoinSpot. It’s a great exchange for traders of all levels and is great if you want flexibility and peace of mind.

2021-09-13,Todayuknews,Croatian E-bike Company Greyp Bikes Integrates Cryptocurrency Payments – Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/croatian-e-bike-company-greyp-bikes-integrates-cryptocurrency-payments-bitcoin-news/,"Greyp Bikes, a company founded by Croatian innovator and entrepreneur Mate Rimac, has integrated crypto payments into its online billing system. All of its high-tech cycling products can now be purchased using nine different coins thanks to a partnership with payment processor Paycek.

Greyp Bikes Accepts Cryptocurrencies for Its Electric Bicycles

Croatia’s Greyp Bikes, which is aiming to rank among technological leaders in the cycling world, has taken another innovative step. The company has introduced support for payments with nine major cryptocurrencies – BTC, ETH, BCH, XLM, XRP, DAI, EOS, USDT, and USDC – through a cooperation with Paycek, the country’s leading crypto payment processor. It recently announced:

“Greyp has always been at the forefront of technology in the biking world, so this was the next logical step to take in the further development of the brand,” the Sveta Nedelja-based manufacturer of high-performance e-bikes added.

The company also noted that while customers had been able to buy its bikes with cryptocurrency even before the partnership with Paycek, crypto payments have now been streamlined and completely integrated into the online checkout process at its website, Greyp.com.

Paycek is a platform developed by Croatian fintech startup Electrocoin. The payment processor has already helped other local companies to start accepting cryptocurrencies. Over 45 Tifon gas stations across Croatia introduced crypto payments through Paycek earlier this year while Electrocoin enabled Croatian Post to offer a crypto exchange service at its post offices two years ago.

“The move should come as no surprise to anyone who monitors what Livno-born entrepreneur Mate Rimac does when it comes to both his cars and his bikes,” the Total Croatia news portal commented in its report on Greyp’s decision to integrate cryptocurrency payments.

The Croatian entrepreneur launched Greyp Bikes in 2013 as a sister company of Rimac Automobili, a manufacturer of electric sports cars which he founded in 2009. The car company is now partially owned by VW Group’s Porsche and Hyundai. In July, Porsche and Rimac announced the establishment of a joint venture that will incorporate Volkswagen’s high-performance brand Bugatti.

Greyp’s integration of cryptocurrencies is not the only such example in the cycling industry. U.K.-based company Toba Electric Bikes, which retails e-bikes manufactured by the Spanish brand BH, introduced support for BTC and BCH payments, and in 2019, released its own utility token in collaboration with SLP-centric trading platform Cryptophyl.

Do you think we are going to see more partnerships like these in the cycling industry? Share your expectations in the comments section below.

2021-09-13,,BBB reports rise in employment scams involving cryptocurrency in B.C.,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/bbb-reports-rise-in-employment-scams-involving-cryptocurrency-in-b-c-1.5582576,"Vancouver -

The Better Business Bureau of Mainland B.C. says reports of employment scams have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many local incidents have had ""a cryptocurrency twist.""

Employment scams - in which job seekers are ""hired"" by fake businesses that then steal their personal information or ask them to commit fraud as part of their ""job"" duties - were a problem before COVID-19, according to the BBB.

In 2019, the bureau estimated that 14 million victims lost a combined $2 billion due to job scams. Last year, the problem got worse, with complaints about such scams to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre nearly doubling.

In B.C., many job scam reports have involved cryptocurrency transactions, the local BBB said in a news release.

""Scammers have been reaching out to job seekers across B.C. using fake company names and websites, and asking them to conduct cryptocurrency transactions as part of their employment duties,"" reads the release.

The bureau shared one example from a job seeker in West Vancouver, who reported that they had been contacted by email with an offer to become an ""online account manager.""

The victim reviewed the job description and contract, and shared it with friends and family, who also found it believable.

The victim signed the contract and sent it back to the scammer with a copy of a photo ID. Then, on the day that training was supposed to begin, the victim was told their first task would be to take $3,000 from the ""company"" and deposit it in a Bitcoin ATM.

""That's a lot of money for someone you just hired,"" the victim said in the BBB release. ""I told her that I didn't feel comfortable with that task and asked for alternative training. She muted me or lost connection during the phone call and I have never heard from her again.""

The BBB recommends researching job offers thoroughly, including checking the business' page on the bureau's website.

It also recommends job seekers consider creating a secondary email address for use when posting a resume on job boards or responding to job listings. Similarly, people should consider making separate bank accounts to handle pay received from jobs in which they've never met their employer in person, the BBB said.

""Be wary of vague job descriptions and double-check mystery shopping or secret shopper positions,"" the BBB said. ""Work-from-home jobs that involve receiving and reshipping packages are likely scams. Also, be very cautious of jobs that involve receiving and forwarding money.""

Anyone who is a victim of an employment scam should report it to the BBB scam tracker and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, the BBB said.","('https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2020/6/12/bitcoin-atm--1-4981524-1631483512987.jpg',)",none
2021-09-13,SABC News,"US Treasury, financial industry discuss cryptocurrency ‘stablecoins’",https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/us-treasury-financial-industry-discuss-cryptocurrency-stablecoins/,"The US Treasury Department met with a number of industry participants this week to quiz them about the risks and benefits posed by stablecoins, a rapidly growing type of cryptocurrencies, the value of which is pegged to traditional currencies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings.

Washington policymakers are alarmed at the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market which exceeded a record $2 trillion in April. As of Friday, the market cap of stablecoins stood at roughly $125 billion, according to industry data site CoinMarketCap. It is unclear which financial regulations apply to these relatively new products.

U.S. financial regulators are working to understand the risks and opportunities posed by cryptocurrencies to the traditional U.S. financial system and plan to issue a number of reports on the subject in coming months, they have said.

In July, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

In a sign those efforts are gathering pace, Treasury officials this week met with financial industry executives to discuss potential stablecoin regulation, the three sources said.

Two of the people said that in meetings this week, one of which took place on Friday, officials asked whether stablecoins would require direct oversight if they become extremely popular. They also discussed how regulators should try to mitigate the risks of too many people trying to cash in their stablecoins at the same time, and whether major stablecoins should be backed by traditional assets.

Officials also asked about how stablecoins should be structured, how they could be used, whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient, and other safety and soundness issues, one of the people said.

Treasury officials also met earlier in the week with a group of banks and credit unions to discuss similar issues, another of the people said. Treasury officials appeared to be gathering information and did not share their thinking on how stablecoins should be regulated, this person added.

The information gathered at this week’s meetings is likely to help shape a broad Treasury report on stablecoins expected in the coming months.

In a statement, Treasury spokesman John Rizzo said the department is examining “potential benefits and risks of stablecoins for users, markets, or the financial system.”

“As this work continues, the Treasury Department is meeting with a broad range of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, members of Congress and market participants,” he added.

Washington policymakers worry the rise in privately-operated currencies could undermine their control of the financial and monetary systems, increase systemic risks, promote financial crime, and hurt investors.","('https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/bitcoin-5.jpg',)",none

Along with this, crypto investors are also watching the formation of a golden cross in Bitcoin. If this bullish setup completes, it will signal a trend in favor of the bulls. For the time being, investors continue to focus on select altcoins that have continued their northward journey.

On the fundamental front, Bitcoin reached another milestone as miners produced the 700,000th block on Sep. 11. Bitcoin was trading near $8,000 when the 600,000th block was reached on Oct. 18, 2019.

Reaching this milestone led some Twitter users to quote Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin’s earliest pioneers who had said:

""Every day that goes by and Bitcoin hasn't collapsed due to legal or technical problems, that brings new information to the market. It increases the chance of Bitcoin's eventual success and justifies a higher price.""

Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may attract trader’s attention in the short term.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin closed below the 200-day SMA ($45,894) on Sep. 10 but bears have not been able to capitalize on this move. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back above the 200-day SMA.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The moving averages are close to completing a golden cross, indicating that the advantage is likely to tilt in favor of the bulls. If buyers push the price above $47,399.97, the BTC/USDT pair will attempt to rise to the overhead zone of $50,500 to $52,920.

The bears are likely to defend the overhead zone aggressively but if bulls do not give up much ground, the likelihood of a break above $52,920 increases. If that happens, the pair could rally to $60,000.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that bears are aggressively defending the 200-day SMA. The pair could then retest the critical support at $42,451.67. A break below this level could tilt the advantage in favor of bears.

BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the price turned down from $47,550 on two occasions. Hence, this becomes an important level to watch out for in the short term. A break and close above this resistance may open the doors for a possible move to $50,500.

However, the moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, indicating that sellers are attempting to make a comeback. A break and close below $44,000 could signal a minor advantage to bears. The pair could then drop to the critical level at $42,451.67.

ALGO/USDT

The long tail on Sep. 7 shows that bulls aggressively bought the dip to the 50-day SMA ($1.10). Strong buying on Sep. 8 propelled Algorand (ALGO) above the stiff overhead resistance at $1.84.

ALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears tried to trap the bulls by sinking the price below the breakout level at $1.84 on Sep. 10 but the buyers had other plans. The ALGO/USDT pair has rebounded off the support with strength today and bulls are currently attempting to thrust the price above $2.49.

If they succeed, the pair could resume the uptrend with the first target on the upside at $3 and then $3.32. On the contrary, if the price once again turns down from $2.49, the pair could drop to $1.84 and stay range-bound between these two levels for the next few days.

A break and close below $1.84 will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap. The pair could then slide to $1.60.

ALGO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that bears are defending the overhead resistance at $2.49. If sellers pull the price below $2.30, the pair could again slide to the breakout level at $1.84. A bounce off this support could suggest a range-bound action for some time.

If bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will increase the possibility of a break above $2.49. If buyers sustain the breakout, it could signal the resumption of the uptrend.

ATOM/USDT

Cosmos (ATOM) bounced off the breakout level at $17.56 on Sep. 7, suggesting that bulls are aggressively defending this support. This was the second instance that bulls successfully held this level, the previous one was on Aug. 26 and 27.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The long tail on Sep. 8 showed that sentiment was turning positive and traders were buying on dips. The moving averages have completed a golden cross, indicating that bulls are back in the driver’s seat.

Strong buying today has pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $32.32. If bulls sustain the breakout, the ATOM/USDT pair may rally to $39.43.

The bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below $32.32 and trap the aggressive bulls. If they succeed, the pair may drop to $26. A break below this level will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened.

The 4-hour chart shows that bears sold the breakout above $32.32 but they could not sustain the pair below $32. This suggests that bulls continue to buy on every minor dip. If bulls sustain the price above $32.32, the pair could rally to $38.49.

Conversely, if bears again pull the price below $32.32, the pair could drop to $30.98. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will attempt to resume the uptrend but if the support cracks, the decline could extend to the critical support at $26.

XTZ/USDT

Tezos (XTZ) completed a successful retest of the breakout level at $4.47 on Sept. 7 and Sept. 8. Although bears pulled the price below the 200-day SMA ($4.19), they could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests accumulation on dips.

The XTZ/USDT pair picked up momentum on Sep. 9 and bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $6.14 on Sep. 10. The long wick on the candlestick of the past two days indicates strong selling near $7.

Hence, this becomes an important resistance for the bulls to cross. If they manage to do that, the pair could retest the all-time high at $8.42. A breakout and close above this level will suggest the start of a new uptrend.

Alternatively, if the price once again turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair could drop to $5. Such a move will suggest aggressive profit-booking at higher levels.

The 4-hour chart shows the pair is currently consolidating between $5.88 and $6.80. If bulls drive and sustain the price above the overhead resistance zone at $6.80 to $6.95, the pair may rally to $7.72.

If the price turns down from $6.80, the pair may extend its range-bound action for some more time. A break and close below $5.88 will be the first sign that bulls are losing their grip. The pair could then drop to the 50-SMA.

EGLD/USD

Elrond (EGLD) rebounded off the 200-day SMA ($131) on Sep. 7 and Sep. 8, suggesting strong demand at lower levels. The moving averages completed a golden cross on Sep. 9 indicating that bulls are back in command.

EGLD/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Sustained buying propelled the EGLD/USDT pair to a new all-time high on Sep. 11 where bears tried to stall the up-move. However, the bulls were in no mood to let go of their advantage and have pushed the price to a new all-time high today.

If bulls sustain the price above $245.80, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend. The bears may pose a stiff challenge at the psychological level at $300, but if bulls can overcome this resistance, the rally may extend to $357.80.

The bears will have to pull and sustain the price below the breakout level at $245.80 to signal a possible change in trend.

EGLD/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the ascending channel pattern. If they manage to do that, the bullish momentum could pick up further and the pair may enter a blow-off phase.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level, the pair may drop to the support line of the channel. A strong rebound off it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips.

A break and close below the channel will be the first sign that the bullish momentum could be weakening.

2021-09-13,AMBCrypto,Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency scams tied to human trafficking in Asia,https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-and-other-crypto-scams-tied-to-human-trafficking-in-asia/,"A raid by Cambodian authorities on a casino hotel freed two alleged hostages and exposed a range of crimes, including crypto gambling and crypto scams, as reported on a local news website. The raid took place within a region called the “China Project” and several detained suspects and the two hostages were from China.

According to a 2021 report by Crypto Head, China was the sixth most targeted country in terms of crypto breaches. In addition to this, the most targeted currency was Bitcoin.

Far from being an isolated incident, human trafficking forms a large part of organized crime in Cambodia. These cases involve perpetrators and victims from different Asian countries. Of late, crypto crimes have also been on the rise. There have been multiple reports recently about victims of human trafficking being forced to lure men and women into investing in Bitcoin and other crypto scams.

The reason for Cambodia’s popularity amongst organized crime masterminds could be due to its poor enforcement of online gambling bans. Another factor could be its regulation of unlicensed cryptocurrency, not being stringent when compared to that in China.

Further, according to the aforementioned Crypto Head report, the most rewarding crypto crime was fraud, with a loss of more than $14 billion since 2011.

Nowhere to go

Due to corrupt institutions and the decentralized nature of crypto, poverty-struck survivors of human trafficking forced to run Bitcoin scams in Cambodia were unlikely to find justice. For many, returning home alive was their only priority.

A regional trend

Looking at this from a different perspective, it is noteworthy that Southeast Asian countries ranked high in cryptocurrencies usage, according to a Statista survey. Furthermore, Cambodia’s neighbor, Vietnam recorded the second highest rate of cryptocurrency usage, with 21% of respondents saying they had used or owned cryptocurrency. The country is also seeing a burgeoning demand for crypto mining equipment. For migrant workers in South East Asia, finding a way to save on remittances has spurred an interest in crypto-based options.

2021-09-13,NewsBTC,Ukraine Adopts New Law To Legalize Bitcoin And Other Cryptocurrencies,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/ukraine-adopts-new-law-to-legalize-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies/,"More governments are acknowledging the staying power of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Ukraine is the latest to join the growing list of countries that have legalized crypto. Just this week, El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. Two weeks ago, Cuba passed a law to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies, citing “reasons of socio-economic interest.” Panama is also drafting new cryptocurrency regulations.

In a nearly unanimous vote, the Parliament in Ukraine passed a law to legalize cryptocurrency. Earlier last month, there were reports of a new cryptocurrency-related bill that would allow payments in cryptocurrencies. As of then, the bill was being prepared in the parliament for the second reading, according to a local report.

On Wednesday, however, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted the draft law “On Virtual Assets”. Thus legally recognizing cryptocurrency in the country for the first time. The law will enter into force after lawmakers approve amendments to the country’s tax code about the taxation of cryptocurrency transactions. Although, the Ukrainian legislature is yet to vote on these changes.

This news comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed the law On Payment Services, another digital currency-related law. The law officially allowed Ukraine’s central bank to issue a central bank digital currency, the digital hryvnia.

What The Law Says

Unlike El Salvador’s move to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, Ukraine’s crypto law clearly states that cryptocurrencies do not constitute legal tender. However, it is an indication that the country is leaning more into bitcoin.

The new law recognizes virtual assets as both secured and unsecured intangible goods. However, cryptocurrencies are not accepted as a legal means of payment, and their exchange for other goods or services will not be allowed.

“Ukrainians will also be able to declare their income in virtual assets,” said Anastasia Bratko of the Ministry of Digital Transformation. She added that the law “guarantees judicial protection of the rights to virtual asset owners.”

The law mandates that the term ‘Financial virtual assets’ be issued by registered entities. Crypto market participants will be able to independently determine the value of virtual assets, open bank accounts to settle transactions, and seek judicial protection for associated rights. Service providers are required to abide by the country’s anti-money laundering regulations and prevent attempts to finance terrorism using their platforms, just like traditional financial institutions.

History Of Crypto In Ukraine

The laws on crypto in Ukraine were previously somewhat gray. Cryptocurrency trading was not illegal in the country even before the legislation. However, there were no laws around it. Locals were allowed to buy and exchange virtual currencies, but companies and exchanges dealing in crypto were often under close watch by law enforcement.

Two years ago, Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation was established. It became very active in the crypto field. It partnered with Binance to jointly work on new crypto rules. The Government’s online portal reported that the Ministry of Digital Transformation partnered with a crypto exchange, Currency.com, a Belarusian service that is allegedly the first regulated exchange in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region to provide support for cryptocurrencies, fiat, and tokenized assets.

Ukrainian authorities have been taking a combative stance towards illegal crypto activities.

In August, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) blocked a network of “clandestine cryptocurrency exchanges” running in the capital city Kyiv. The SBU alleged these exchanges were facilitating money laundering and providing anonymity of transactions.

Current authorities have maintained a positive attitude towards the country’s growing crypto industry. By 2022, the country plans to open the cryptocurrency market to businesses and investors, according to this Kyiv Post.

On an official state visit to the U.S. last month, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, called on top investors, venture capital funds to actively cooperate with Ukraine. He spoke of Ukraine’s budding “legal innovative market for virtual assets” as a selling point for investment. Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, also said that the country was modernizing its payment market so that its National Bank would be able to issue digital currency.

2021-09-13,Bitcoin News,Arbitrum Surpasses $1.5 Billion in TVL Following Rumors of a Possible Token Airdrop – Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/arbitrum-surpasses-1-5-billion-in-tvl-following-rumors-of-a-possible-token-airdrop/,"Arbitrum Surpasses $1.5 Billion in TVL Following Rumors of a Possible Token Airdrop

Arbitrum, a second layer expansion rollup for Ethereum, has breached the $1.5 billion of total value locked (TVL) in protocols using its services. The smart contract recorded an influx of more than 1 billion just today after a rumor started in social media that the protocol might be planning to issue its own token in the coming days. The second layer was launched on mainnet less than two weeks ago.

Arbitrum Blows Past $1.5 Billion TVL

Arbitrum, an L2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has reached a new milestone, breaking the $1.5 billion in TVL in less than two weeks since it launched in mainnet. It had a big influx of liquidity yesterday, with more than $1 billion entering the network according to info from L2Beat. Protocols in Ethereum are still adapting their structures to include Arbitrum services, but the layer has experienced sizable support, even when Ethereum heavy hitters like Compound and Aave still haven’t adopted it.

Most users are flocking to the first farming platform in Arbitrum, called Arbinyan (related to the nyan cat meme). Arbinyan has 1.48 Billion TVL, meaning that almost all of the funds in Arbitrum have been moved to get the astounding yields the farm is offering (3,314.70% APY in the Nyan pool at the time of writing).

Token Rumors

However, there might be another reason why these funds have moved to the Arbitrum layer. A rumor about the possible issuance of a native token as an airdrop spread yesterday on social platforms like Twitter. Cryptocurrency influencer Cobie inquired about it, declaring:

“ETH L2s (Optimism/Arbitrum) almost definitely gonna do a dydx/uniswap style retrospective token drop right?”

However, apart from the rumor, Offchain Labs has not declared anything regarding the possible issuance of a native token. In fact, Arbitrum had to clarify the subject in its official Twitter account. It declared:

Reminder: there is no Arbitrum token. Anything claiming to be an official Arbitrum token is a scam.

Ethereum users are always on the lookout for protocols that lack a native token, waiting for a possible airdrop to happen. Last week, Dydx, a decentralized derivatives exchange, released the airdropped native token for its users. The protocol gave some of its heavy users $50K for using the platform. This is why there is such a buzz on the possible issuance of a native token by the protocol.

The governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shaktikanta Das, has once again expressed concerns regarding the impact of cryptocurrencies on India’s financial stability.

Crypto Presents ‘Serious Concerns’ to RBI

The Indian government is currently awaiting the Cabinet to take up the crypto bill. However, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), still has major concerns about cryptocurrencies. Governor Shaktikanta Das reportedly said Wednesday:

We have serious, major concerns on cryptocurrency with respect to financial stability, [and] have conveyed the same to government of India.

This is not the first time the RBI chief has voiced concerns regarding cryptocurrencies. In June, he similarly said: “We have major concerns on cryptocurrency, which we have conveyed to the government. With regard to advice to investors, well, central banks don’t give any investment advice. It’s up to each investor to make his own appraisal, to do his own due diligence and take a very careful call with regard to his own investments.”

India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, said in July: “The Cabinet note is ready. We have to see when the Cabinet can take it up and consider it so that then we can move it.”

However, the Economic Times reported last week that the Indian government is still working on how to regulate cryptocurrencies and is planning to treat them as commodities and regulate per use cases.

This week, the chairman of India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, Jayant Sinha, said India’s crypto legislation will be “distinct and unique” due to the country’s unique circumstances. It will not follow countries such as the U.S., Japan, or El Salvador which recently adopted bitcoin as legal tender.

Meanwhile, the RBI said it plans to unveil a digital rupee model by the end of the year and launch in phases.

What do you think about the concerns voiced by the RBI governor? Let us know in the comments section below.

2021-09-12,Benzinga,"Dogecoin Prepares To Run After Rolling Over With Bitcoin, Ethereum",https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/09/22900131/dogecoin-prepares-to-run-after-rolling-over-with-bitcoin-ethereum,"Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) rolled over along with leader cryptocurrency’s Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) Sept. 7 just prior to El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as legal tender.

On September 2 the Shibu-Inu themed alt-coin broke up from a descending trendline that had been holding it down since its Aug. 16 high of 35 cents and soared up almost 10% higher. Technically speaking the break of the trend should have carried the crypto higher but Bitcoin’s sharp decline caused Dogecoin to plumet 30%.

On Sunday Dogecoin was behaving bullishly, trading higher in line with Bitcoin and Ethereum although on lower than average volume. When a large impulsive move up or down takes place in a stock or crypto it is usually followed by a multi-day period of consolidation to allow for new patterns to develop.

The Dogecoin Chart: Since closing the day on Sept. 7 at the 25-cent mark Dogecoin has spent the past 5 days consolidating the move. In its consolidation Dogecoin has settled under another descending trendline –trading lower into a tightening range while holding above a key support level at 23 cents.

History often repeats on stock and crypto charts and because Dogecoin broke up from a descending trendline the last time it created the pattern it is likely Dogecoin may make the same upwards move from the most recent pattern. If Dogecoin breaks above the descending trendline traders and investors will want to see big volume come in on the break for confirmation the pattern was recognized.

Dogecoin is trading below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs)with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, both of which are bearish indicators. On Sunday Dogecoin regained the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), however, indicating overall sentiment is now bullish.","('https://cdn2.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/doge4.jpg?width=720',)",none
2021-09-12,Revolt TV,Ja Rule has created his own cryptocurrency and launched a new NFT platform,https://www.revolt.tv/news/2021/9/12/22669941/ja-rule-has-created-his-own-cryptocurrency-and-launched-new-nft-platform,"Interest in cryptocurrency continues to rise among the hip hop community. Ja Rule is just one of the growing list of rappers getting involved in the recent crypto craze. Ja just helped launch a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace called Flipkick.io with serial entrepreneur Robert Testagrossa and engineer James Cropcho. The site serves as a platform for artists and celebrities like Ja, plus creators, to monetize their work in NFT form. In March, the Murder Inc. rapper sold a Fyre Festival painting for $122,000 in cryptocurrency. And in June, he inked a deal with the Ethereum-based startup Roll.

Ja spoke about his recent crypto endeavors in an interview with Bitcoin.com. The multi-platinum recording artist explained to the outlet that his first introduction to NFTs was with NBA Top Shot. “I started collecting Top Shot NFTs and I didn’t even realize they were NFTs at the time,” he said. “I just thought they were like the new digital sports cards.”

When approached with the opportunity to team up with Testagrossa and Cropcho on Flipkick.io, Ja said he though the platform was “a great idea.” “As I got into NFTs I noticed a dope project and the whole angle was something different, which I really loved,” he explained. “The angle of taking physical works of art and authenticating them in a similar way NFTs are authenticated on the blockchain but with a chip…It’s just a smart thing to be able to authenticate physical artworks cryptographically and let these amazing artists be able to enjoy the fruits of their work and it was never possible before in the past. So I really applaud what Flipkick is as far as the physical NFT space.”

Further in the interview, Ja said he loves both Bitcoin and Ethereum. He even stated that he believes digital currency is the “obvious” next step in economics. “I hold a little Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano,” Ja said. “I actually have my own cryptocurrency, it’s really social token that I have with a company called ICONN. I haven’t launched it or anything yet but I guess this is going to be my coming out party because I just mentioned it. I have my own currency, I just haven’t launched it yet but it’s definitely ready to go.”","('https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAOmz07bbFrPW-HwLG57QQirSF0=/0x0:3927x2056/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844482/A8E2976B_B752_4AD9_B948_FBD76E573BCF.jpeg',)",none
2021-09-12,Engadget,The US may crack down on 'stable' cryptocurrencies,https://www.engadget.com/stablecoin-us-regulation-crackdown-143610224.html,"Stablecoins are ostensibly safer than regular cryptocurrency thanks to their ties to less volatile assets, but US regulators apparently aren't convinced. Bloomberg sources hear the Treasury Department and other federal agencies are close to a possible crackdown on stablecoins through a review from the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Officials are reportedly concerned the digital money is largely unregulated and could ultimately destabilize the financial system, not protect it.

A presidential Working Group on Financial Markets is believed to be most concerned about Tether. The cryptocurrency's operators said they stabilize their funds by holding large amounts of corporate debt. That could be vulnerable to ""chaotic investor runs"" if cryptocurrency values tank, according to Bloomberg.

While a firm decision isn't expected until December, when the Working Group is believed to be issuing recommendations, there's reportedly a ""consensus"" in favor of an Oversight Council review. If that happens, the council could label stablecoins as threats that warrant strict regulation. Numerous cryptocurrencies could be forced to change their business models or even shut down.

As it stands, stablecoins are at risk from government competition. The Federal Reserve is exploring the possibility of launching a central bank cryptocurrency. Such a move could render private options moot in the US — there wouldn't be much point to them if there was an official, potentially more reliable equivalent. Whatever happens, it's safe to say the existing stablecoin market might not last long as-is if a review goes forward.","('https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/21a895d0-13ce-11ec-adef-9b74e8a3ec9f',)",none

Is it just a fad or is the future of the art world? ET’s Anandi Chandrashekhar explains. Watch

Football superstar Lionel Messi recently launched his own collection of NFTs , or non-fungible tokens, that were created using his image by an Australia-based digital designer and are expected to make billions of dollars.In India too, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan has launched his own NFTs, which are themed around his life. Before him, Sunny Leone became the first Bollywood actress to launch her own NFT collection of unique, hand-animated art.Messi, Big B and Leone are not alone in this business. The popularity of NFT, a type of digital asset, has exploded beyond anyone’s imagination in recent years. NFT artworks have been selling for millions and attracting the attention of big brands, celebrities and icons.In simple terms, NFTs are digital assets that exist on a public blockchain that serves as a record of ownership. While anyone can view the items, only the buyer of an NFT has the ‘official’ status of being its owner.Unlike digital items that can be endlessly modified and reproduced, each NFT has its own digital footprint, which makes it one of a kind. All kinds of digital objects such as images, text, videos, music and even tweets can be converted into NFTs and that process is called “minting” (Yes, like in the cryptocurrency world).The fact that NFTs can give buyers a sense of “unique ownership” and “Digital Immortality” has unlocked exciting opportunities for digital commerce and engagement.Despite being in existence since 2017, the popularity of NFTs surged only in 2021. According to DappRadar, a Lithuania-based data tracking company, trading volumes of top NFT collections such as Axie Infinity, CryptoPunks and ArtBlocks increased 300% and generated more than $1.5 billion in sales.Another report published in Forbes pegged NFT sales at over $1.2 billion – almost half of the $2.5 billion cumulative sales volume in the first two quarters of 2021 – while the dapp (decentralised applications) industry as a whole registered more than 1.4 million daily unique users, a 23.72% increase from the previous month.In the crypto world, the idea of integrating NFTs and e-commerce platforms has been making headlines for a while now. Experts believe due to its digital nature and long shelf life, NFTs can play a significant role in the world of e-commerce and market with high-end goods.“As mixed reality technologies mature, regular people are going to spend more and more of their time — and therefore money — in virtual environments,” a research associate affiliated with a French international banking group told a Business channel.Since NFTs are digital in nature, they do not involve the hassles or cost of shipping products (even though there is a certain minting and hosting fee that needs to be paid to the marketplace showcasing the NFTs as collections).Big opportunities await luxury brands that can potentially offer exclusive and limited NFTs without having to worry about counterfeits since the metadata on the token cannot be changed by users.However, all good things come with certain challenges. And in the case of NFTs, the issue of copyright is one. As the market for NFT grows, cases of digital art being copied on the NFT platforms have surfaced, calling for a strict recourse on digital theft and modification.Though some platforms such as OpenSea and Nifty Gateway provide users with the option to report or appeal copyright infringement in their terms of service, the absence of any official trademark makes it harder for the creators to lay a claim in the world of the internet.The issue of cyber-security also looms, as several users have reported about accounts being hacked and NFTs worth thousands of dollars getting stolen.(The author, Samrat Kishor , is Tech Strategy Consultant & Entrepreneur, Golden Next Ventures.

The cryptocurrency market is thriving in the financial sector by operating the whole day throughout the years for efficient cryptocurrency trading. Investors from different levels across the world are highly interested in investing time and money in a volatile venture. But, investors need to check the current cryptocurrency prices constantly to gain higher revenue and avoid a massive loss within a short period of time. That is when the emergence of crypto trading bots comes to cover the round-the-clock structure for these investors in this fast-paced life. Cryptocurrency bots are known crypto trading bots that can provide meaningful analysis of the current cryptocurrency trading across the world. Chatbots are known for automating tasks and serving customer queries for enhancing customer experience. Crypto trading bots also consist of the same features— place orders to exchange automatically in the cryptocurrency market while investors can focus on their mental health.

Pros of crypto trading bots:

Lack of emotional attachment: Investors are humans with different kinds of emotions attached to the cryptocurrency market. Being a highly volatile market, cryptocurrency trading is very risky to deal with emotional attachments. Thus, one of the pros of crypto trading bots is that these bots lack the emotional attachment— an automated machine-centric process to avoid serious consequences.

Crypto trading efficiently: Crypto trading bots has made the process of cryptocurrency trading more efficient owing to their multitasking functionalities while providing investors with ample opportunities and data analysis for making smart decisions at crucial times

Simple investment: The cryptocurrency market is very complicated for investors who are at the beginner’s level. They face problems in having a clear understanding of complicated charts, data analysis, price analysis, and many more. But crypto trading bots can transform the complicated process of investment into a simple investment through automation. This is one of the top pros of using crypto trading bots.

Cons of crypto trading bots:

Limited cryptocurrencies: There are more than hundreds of cryptocurrencies in the cryptocurrency market for efficient cryptocurrency trading. But, one of the cons of these crypto trading bots is the access to limited cryptocurrencies. These are known as specialized software tools that work with limited digital exchanges.

Unexpected decisions: Crypto trading bots work automatically throughout 24*7*365. But this tends to be one of the cons of crypto trading bots— it takes unexpected decisions on the behalf of investors leading to a minor gain or loss, depending on the cryptocurrency prices

Time-consuming process: While the functionality of automating tasks can be time-saving but setting up the whole process of implementing crypto trading bots is a time-consuming process for learning to manage the tools efficiently without any potential error","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pros-and-Cons-Different-Roles-of-Crypto-Trading-Bots.jpg',)",none
2021-09-12,Cointelegraph,Finding a new home: Bitcoin miners settling down after China exodus,https://cointelegraph.com/news/finding-a-new-home-bitcoin-miners-settling-down-after-china-exodus,"A few months ago, the crypto industry was shaken up by the news of the mass exodus of miners from China. At the end of May 2021, it became known that the Chinese authorities were going to ban Bitcoin (BTC) mining, bringing the already existing regulatory pressure on miners to a breaking point.

The list of banned operations includes purchasing cryptocurrencies, as well as any related investment activities, crypto trading and exchange. The People’s Bank of China had held substantive consultations with banks and payment systems and then the largest Chinese financial institutions were told to stop speculative trading — in particular, with BTC.

As a result, Bitcoin’s hash rate showed one of the largest drops in its history. China’s share of BTC mining dropped 55% since the beginning of the year, as many Bitcoin network participants turned off their equipment.

This was confirmed as China’s secondary market filled with GPU cards. Miners were actively selling cards, including the all-powerful GeForce RTX 3090 and Radeon RX 6900 XT at below-market prices.

Of course, not all miners capitulated, especially the large pools. The logical way out of the situation was “mining migration” to other countries. But where did the Chinese miners move to, and which countries can become the new mecca of mining?

Is mining truly bad for China?

Before trying to find out where the miners are leaving, it is worth understanding why the Chinese government banned mining, and what consequences such a decision will have on the crypto industry and even on some sectors of the country’s economy.

After the introduction of the ban, the largest mining pools were the first to react. Huobi, BTC.TOP and HashCow have ceased their activities in whole or partially. One of the largest crypto exchanges in the country, Huobi, suspended both crypto mining and some trading services for new clients from mainland China.

Mining company BTC.TOP announced it was suspending its business in China, citing risks, while HashCow has said it will stop buying new BTC mining stations.

The largest producer of Bitcoin mining equipment in the world, Bitmain, temporarily suspended sales at the end of June 2021. The company made this decision after prices plummeted by 75%. The suspension affected only BTC miners, while Bitmain continues to sell the equipment for altcoin mining.

According to the Chinese government, the problem in mining was the high consumption of electricity. China, which was home to most of the BTC mining pools, relies mainly on coal power, which produces a lot of pollution.

But according to some commentators in the crypto industry, the real motive of the Chinese authorities was not to preserve the country’s ecology but to promote its own cryptocurrency, the digital yuan — i.e., by banning BTC mining, the Chinese government “clears” the space for its own central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Now the development of the digital yuan is in full swing. At the end of June 2021, subway passengers in Beijing were able to buy tickets using the digital yuan. And two weeks earlier, the Agricultural Bank of China was the first in the country to allow its clients to convert digital yuan into cash and vice versa.

At the same time, the government appears to be actively suppressing competitors to the CBDC. In 2020, the initial public offering of Ant Financial — Alibaba’s fintech business — was thwarted largely due to Chinese authorities’ fears that the Alipay payments system would compete with the digital yuan.

So, is it possible that miners were simply collateral damage on the way to the country’s goal to support the widely implemented digital national currency? After all, the latest crypto ban did not prohibit anything new, as existing restrictions were already spelled out in 2017.

New mining centers

China, where three-quarters of all BTC used to be mined, began to reduce its share in global mining long before the prohibitive measures were introduced in May.

According to research by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance on global Bitcoin mining from September 2019 to April 2021, China was gradually becoming less attractive for crypto enthusiasts. This can be considered a confirmation of the tough policy of the state’s government. Nevertheless, the country’s share of Bitcoin mining remained high and amounted to about 46%. However, as Fei Cao, CEO of Huobi Pool, told Cointelegraph:

“This year, the key trends for digital mining are an increased compliance and capital requirements, and these two trends seem more promising in the North American region, where mining is legal under local regulations.”

Cao’s words are confirmed by the statistics as the United States currently has more than quadrupled its share in world mining BTC — from 4.1% to 16.8%.

Over the years, the U.S. has been building up its hosting capacity, long before the Chinese ban, even when the crypto market was experiencing a serious decline. American mining companies were especially active when large BTC farms were not in great demand, for example, in 2017.

In addition, the U.S. also has some of the cheapest energy sources on the planet, many of which are renewable. Moreover, American investors themselves are interested in cooperating with miners. At a recent meeting in Texas, U.S. oil and gas executives suggested miners use surplus natural gas to generate electricity.

Cheap electricity is also very attractive for large manufacturers of mining equipment. For example, back in 2020, Bitmain entered into a partnership agreement with Digital Currency Group’s subsidiary, Foundry, which provides funding to Bitmain clients from North America and supplies a large batch of devices for mining BTC.

Kazakhstan has also shown strong growth in its share in the world of Bitcoin mining this year — increasing from 1.4% to 8.6%.

This country borders China, so the cost of transporting equipment is cheaper than transporting it across the ocean to North America. Furthermore, lawmakers in Kazakhstan are making the country more attractive to miners by allowing local banks to open accounts for cryptocurrency transactions. In addition, a mining company can be officially registered in the country since digital currency was officially legalized back in 2020.

Chinese companies have already taken advantage of this. Large cryptocurrency miner provider Canaan announced in June that it had started mining BTC in Kazakhstan. Crypto mining firm BIT Mining, which recently announced that it would expand from the Chinese market, plans to acquire 2,500 BTC miners for deployment in Kazakhstan. According to experts, the Chinese miners sent about 4,000 mining devices to Kazakhstan.

Related: Slow to start: Crypto regulators lagging behind blockchain industry

Another important factor for Kazakhstan’s popularity as a destination for miners is rather low prices for electricity where 1 kilowatt costs $0.03. However, the country’s energy system isn’t as big as the United States’.

Russia has also increased its share in global mining to 6.5%. As in the case of Kazakhstan, Russia has a border with China, which is convenient when transporting mining equipment. The Russian Association of Crypto Industry and Blockchain (RACIB) in July 2021 outlined the advantages of mining in the country, highlighting a surplus of cheap electricity.

Given the country’s diverse climate, mining farms can be installed in regions with cold climates, which will reduce cooling costs while maximizing expected profits.

In addition, the RACIB entered into a partnership agreement with a consortium of the largest mining companies in China, which until recently controlled 25% of Bitcoin’s hash rate.

Miners will move, mining will remain

Less than six months after the Chinese ban, miners have found a new home, perhaps even better than the previous one, and Bitcoin’s hash rate is predictably recovering.

So, Chinese miners will not disappear but will only change their location. “Due to the impact of changing policies and regulations around the world, the BTC mining industry is currently in a phase of transformation,” Cao said, adding:

“The outdated mining machines in the industry have been retired, but at the same time, more advanced new mining machines will be introduced to the market to make up for lost supply.”","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDgvZjVmZGYxYjQtMzlkZC00NDNiLWI1NmUtMzZmMDRmZDY3ZGQ0LmpwZw==.jpg',)",none

Markets began the week on a positive note, with Bitcoin first crossing the $50,000 mark and then $51,000 and then $52,000. The overall market capitalization had shot past $2.3 trillion.However, the market took a drastic U-turn on Tuesday as Bitcoin dropped from near $53,000 levels to around $43,000. In one of the largest liquidation events in months, 328,000+ traders were liquidated. The total value of liquidations surpassed a whopping $3.54 billion.The crash coincided with El Salvador’s implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender. Before the crash, several Redditors initiated a campaign to buy $30 worth of Bitcoin to show their support to El Salvador. President of El Salvador president Nayib Bukele tweeted that the country added 550 Bitcoins to its treasury.After the crash, the crypto heavyweights recovered briefly. Thereafter, it was a pretty flat week for Bitcoin and Ether. The third-largest crypto by market capitalization, Cardano, which had a fantastic rally during the beginning of the month, remained under the grip of bears this past week.However, it was not all gloomy for the investors. Solana , the closest competitor to Ethereum , has been a hot favorite of several investors lately. A fantastic rally propelled it to the spot of the sixth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization.Another interesting crypto project that did spectacularly well was Algorand. Its native token, ALGO, managed to grab eyeballs and rose to the seventeenth position. ALGO did not tank hard even during some of the severe market crashes over the past three months. The total crypto market cap stood at around $2.07 trillion as of September 11, 2021.The US Securities and Exchange Commission appears to have locked horns with cryptocurrency exchanges lately. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has threatened to sue Coinbase if the crypto exchange goes ahead with its plans to launch a program allowing users to earn interest by lending crypto assets.The SEC is also investigating the crypto exchange developer Uniswap Labs, the lead developer behind one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Uniswap, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.Among the top 10 cryptocurrencies , the best performer for the week has been Solana. All other coins among the top 10 ended the week in the red. The worst performer among the top 10 this past week was the meme-coin, Dogecoin.Reports suggest that institutional investors have continued to ramp up their Bitcoin holdings. Asset managers accumulated more than 4% of Bitcoin's total supply, while both private and public companies, both hold more than 1% of it.Additionally, Investment bank Morgan Stanley bought shares worth $240 million of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).

2021-09-12,NDTV.com,Bitcoin Vs Altcoins: How Are They Different?,https://www.ndtv.com/business/how-are-altcoins-different-from-bitcoin-2535449,"Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency which was launched in 2009

The rapid popularity of cryptocurrency has led to thousands of them coming into existence. While they offer options to investors, they also make them nervous. Given the relatively new nature of the industry, it is wise to be able to distinguish between them. Broadly, there are two categories: Bitcoin and Altcoins. Given its dominant appeal, Bitcoin is the largest crypto. As the blockchain technology, on which cryptocurrency is based, matured, it led to the emergence of a number of new crypto coins – like Ethereum. These new coins were dubbed “altcoins”, short for alternative coins.

These altcoins are based on the same principle as Bitcoin but take things a step further with some additions and unique features.

What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, proposed in October 2008 and launched in January next year. It was invented by a pseudonymous person or group of persons known as “Satoshi Nakamoto.” Bitcoin is a decentralised peer-to-peer digital currency and all transactions are entered into an online public ledger that is available to everyone. It does not require any intermediary, say a bank or any other financial institution, to facilitate transactions.

What Is Altcoin?

Except for Bitcoin, all other crypto coins are generically called “Altcoins”, which basically mean alternative to Bitcoin. There are more than 11,000 crypto coins listed on CoinMarketCap, a market research organisation. All these are altcoins.

How Are They Different From Bitcoin?

Altcoins were built on the success of Bitcoin by slightly changing the rules to appeal to specific users. For example, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, introduced the idea of “smart contracts”. These smart contracts are basically codes that run only when predetermined conditions are met. They execute agreements between two parties using blockchain technology, opening possibilities for the development of new applications for crypto.

Altcoins have improved functionality, transaction, and scaling to meet the rapidly expanding demand. As the market for altcoins continues to expand, many wonder if the original cryptocurrency's lead will end with any of the coins that came after it. Simply put, Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and all others are “Altcoins.”","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/2r1h0gng_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none

The U.S. Treasury Department met with a number of industry participants this week to quiz them about the risks and benefits posed by stablecoins -- a rapidly growing type of cryptocurrencies, the value of which is pegged to traditional currencies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings.

Washington policymakers are alarmed at the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market which exceeded a record $2 trillion in April. As of Friday, the market cap of stablecoins stood at roughly $125 billion, according to industry data site CoinMarketCap. It is unclear which financial regulations apply to these relatively new products.

U.S. financial regulators are working to understand the risks and opportunities posed by cryptocurrencies to the traditional U.S. financial system and plan to issue a number of reports on the subject in coming months, they have said.

In July, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. read more

The information gathered at this week’s meetings is likely to help shape a broad Treasury report on stablecoins expected in the coming months.

In a statement, Treasury spokesman John Rizzo said the department is examining ""potential benefits and risks of stablecoins for users, markets, or the financial system.""

""As this work continues, the Treasury Department is meeting with a broad range of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, members of Congress and market participants,” he added.

Washington policymakers worry the rise in privately-operated currencies could undermine their control of the financial and monetary systems, increase systemic risks, promote financial crime, and hurt investors.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also working on cryptocurrency projects, they have said.

Blockchain company Algorand Foundation is putting 150 million ALGO, worth $309 million at time of writing, into the Viridis DeFi Program in an effort to fuel the growth of development on its platform.

Sean Lee, chief executive officer of the Algorand Foundation, says the fund will help accelerate the adoption of DeFi across the project’s ecosystem.

“Creating the right infrastructure, application ecosystem, and liquidity will be key to ensuring that DeFi on Algorand is regarded as the world’s most energy-efficient, scalable and low-cost DeFi ecosystem.”

The first 100 million ALGO will be devoted to providing support and liquidity incentives to the Algorand DeFi ecosystem. The other 50 million ALGO will be earmarked for the development of DeFi infrastructure and applications (DApps).

ALGO has been surging in price this week as most of the cryptocurrency market suffers through a correction. The 18th-ranked asset by market cap is trading at $2.06 at time of writing and is up 68.4% in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko.

Popular crypto trader and analyst Lark Davis says the existence of these ecosystem funds is a bullish development for the sector overall.

“Most of the big chains have announced multi-hundred million dollar funds to bootstrap ecosystems over the last few weeks. No one is bullish enough!”

The developers claim that Solana has the fastest blockchain in the world, that is capable of supporting contracts, NFTs and other platforms in the rapidly growing space of decentralized finance.

Solana has cryptographic time-sampling that can accommodate between 50 to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), each transaction at a meagre cost of $0.00025. In comparison to this, Bitcoin and Ethereum can have 5TPS at a cost of $5 per transaction and 13 TPS at a cost of $10-65 depending on network traffic.

The Solana system uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that reduces the requirement for high power.

Solana ecosystem has introduced a proof of History (PoH) system, that allows the validators on the network to compute the state of the network from the ledger itself.

Bitcoin’s sharp fall to $44,000, in the aftermath of El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption, left the global crypto market bruised with a decline to $2.03 trillion. It also left several leading cryptocurrencies including Ethereum Binance , Dogecoin in a similar state. However, undeterred by the crash, altcoin Solana reached an all-time high value of $214.96 on 9th September according to CoinMarketCap’s price index. With the price surge, Solana's market capital increased to around $60 billion, leaving Dogecoin and Ripple closely behind.Solana's astronomical rise from last year’s $2 is not a mere coincidence. It has consistently witnessed double-digit growth and recorded a 430 percent increase in the last 30 days. The investors of Solana hope that it would eventually leave Ethereum and Cardano behind.The developers of Solana believe that the reason behind Solana’s double-digit steady growth since last year lies in its underlying technology that is equipped with following novel features:Solana currently has 400 projects running on its platform. Among these projects, crypto exchange Aldrin launched by Hisham Khan merges both centralised and decentralised finance. According to Hisham, Solana lowers the barriers of entry, facilitating mass adoption of the decentralised financing. The developers of Solana aim to have transactions at lightning speed across the world and compete with NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-86117273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-207856,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-09-11,NDTV.com,El Salvador's Icing On Bitcoin Cake - Foreign Investors Won't Pay Tax On Profit,https://www.ndtv.com/business/el-salvadors-icing-on-bitcoin-cake-foreign-investors-wont-pay-tax-on-profit-2537563,"Experts and regulators have highlighted concerns about the cryptocurrency's notorious volatility

El Salvador will exempt foreign investors from taxes on profits on bitcoin speculation in the country, a government adviser said Friday, after it became the first to recognize the cryptocurrency as legal tender.

""If a person has assets in bitcoin and makes high profits, there will be no tax. This (is done) obviously to encourage foreign investment,"" Javier Argueta, legal adviser to President Nayib Bukele, told AFP.

""There will be no taxes to pay on either the capital increase or the income.""

El Salvador introduced bitcoin as legal tender on Tuesday alongside the dollar, which has been the official currency for 20 years.

Experts and regulators have highlighted concerns about the cryptocurrency's notorious volatility, its potential impact on price inflation in a country with high poverty and unemployment, and the lack of protection for users.

There are also fears over its potential for illegal use -- notably in laundering money from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, and in financing terrorism.

According to Argueta, the cyber ""wallet"" allowing Salvadorans at home and abroad to buy and spend bitcoin, includes ""relevant mechanisms"" to ensure traceability.

""We are implementing a series of recommendations from international institutions against money laundering,"" the adviser added.

He said bitcoin transactions would be halted temporarily if its value were ever to collapse, in order to minimize the impact of extreme currency fluctuation.

The government says its experiment will give many Salvadorans access to bank services for the first time, and hopes it will shave millions of dollars off commissions on remittances sent home from abroad, mainly the United States.

2021-09-11,NDTV Gadgets 360,Bitcoin Doesn't Make a Great Deal of Sense: Billionaire Investor Lee Cooperman,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-price-lee-cooperman-not-make-sense-too-old-gold-invest-2537246,"Cryptocurrency has been growing rapidly over the past year, but many investors are yet not sure about it. One of them is Lee Cooperman. The US billionaire investor and hedge fund manager says he still does not understand Bitcoin. Speaking to CNBC, he stopped just short of criticising Bitcoin, saying only that people his age are finding it difficult to understand the world's largest cryptocurrency. He made it clear that he thinks it's not in the interest of the US government to further a substitute for the dollar.

“I have great respect for [media mogul] Barry Diller. And I think he was online recently and I think that he said that Bitcoin was a ‘con job'. I don't know if this is a con job, but I take the easy way out. I say: ‘If you don't understand Bitcoin, it means you're old. I'm 78. I'm old. I don't understand it,” Cooperman said during an interview. He added that Bitcoin “does not make a great deal of sense” and he would be very careful in dealing with it.

The chairman of Omega Advisors, a New York-based investment advisory firm, also appeared unsure about the prospects of Bitcoin to become a global currency, asserting it was not in US interest to promote an alternative to the American dollar. He said if people are nervous about the trajectory the world is following and want to save money for the future, then gold should be their preferred choice.

""If you don't understand #bitcoin, it means you're old. I'm 78. I'm old. I don't understand it,"" says Lee Cooperman. ""I'd be very careful with #btc. It does not make a great deal of sense, and if you are nervous about the world gold to me would a better place to store value."" pic.twitter.com/OANWHHjpWx — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) September 9, 2021

Cooperman's statement is in keeping with his stance on cryptocurrency since at least 2017, when Bitcoin was relatively less popular. Although Bitcoin, and largely all other cryptocurrency are ripe with unpredictability, several young billionaire entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Michael Saylor, have shown faith in cryptocurrency's potential to become the global currency or at least grow to a level to become a legal currency along with the fiat money.

On September 7, El Salvador officially adopted Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the US dollar. Though initial rollout hiccups led to a fall in Bitcoin price, the virtual currency has now stabilised. As of September 11, Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.04 lakhs.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_disco_reuters_1622203490843.jpg',)",none

Washington policymakers are alarmed at the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market which exceeded a record $2 trillion in April. As of Friday, the market cap of stablecoins stood at roughly $125 billion, according to industry data site CoinMarketCap. It is unclear which financial regulations apply to these relatively new products.

U.S. financial regulators are working to understand the risks and opportunities posed by cryptocurrencies to the traditional US financial system and plan to issue a number of reports on the subject in coming months, they have said.

In July, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

In a sign those efforts are gathering pace, Treasury officials this week met with financial industry executives to discuss potential stablecoin regulation, the three sources said.

Two of the people said that in meetings this week, one of which took place on Friday, officials asked whether stablecoins would require direct oversight if they become extremely popular. They also discussed how regulators should try to mitigate the risks of too many people trying to cash in their stablecoins at the same time, and whether major stablecoins should be backed by traditional assets.

Officials also asked about how stablecoins should be structured, how they could be used, whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient, and other safety and soundness issues, one of the people said.

Treasury officials also met earlier in the week with a group of banks and credit unions to discuss similar issues, another of the people said. Treasury officials appeared to be gathering information and did not share their thinking on how stablecoins should be regulated, this person added.

The information gathered at this week's meetings is likely to help shape a broad Treasury report on stablecoins expected in the coming months.

In a statement, Treasury spokesman John Rizzo said the department is examining ""potential benefits and risks of stablecoins for users, markets, or the financial system.""

""As this work continues, the Treasury Department is meeting with a broad range of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, members of Congress and market participants,” he added.

Washington policymakers worry the rise in privately-operated currencies could undermine their control of the financial and monetary systems, increase systemic risks, promote financial crime, and hurt investors.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also working on cryptocurrency projects, they have said.

2021-09-11,,Top Cryptocurrencies to Buy this Weekend,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-cryptocurrencies-to-buy-this-weekend-4/,"Top Cryptocurrencies to Buy this Weekend

It all started with a few cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and today there is a vast list of such currencies that people are keen to invest in. With differing degrees of utility, adoption and promise, the cryptocurrency market has managed to garner attention from every corner of the globe. The attention and popularity that the digital currencies enjoy has surely made investors decipher as to which are the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. On that note, we present to you our find of the top cryptocurrencies to buy this weekend. Keep reading.

Bitcoin

Ever since this cryptocurrency came into existence, no wonder, it has been a dominant player. Not just the retail investors but institutional investors are also making their way into Bitcoin investment. Additionally, Bitcoin is considered to be a medium for countries to guard against currency depreciation as well as faster and cheaper fund transfer across borders. Being the one with the largest market capitalization, Bitcoin, undoubtedly holds huge potential for positive returns, just like it has strived to do to date.

Ethereum

After Bitcoin, undoubtedly, all eyes turn to Ethereum – the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. Ethereum has already made the headlines by being the leading platform for decentralized finance, or DeFi. With this platform, the users can now create smart contracts that get executed automatically when the conditions are met. Yet another aspect that makes Ethereum stand apart from the rest is its potential to cut out third parties like banks, clearing houses, banks, etc. As the investors have gained quite a good return as a result of their investment in Ethereum, the same trend is likely to continue for the years ahead.

Cardano

Just like Ethereum, Cardano is also a decentralized blockchain platform that enables peer-to-peer transactions. A point that is worth noting is that these transactions are extremely secure. What has paved the way for the wide acceptance of Cardano across the globe is its extremely low level of energy consumption when compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin. Cardano is on its way to enabling smart contracts, thereby leaving us with no doubts pertaining to how valuable investing in this digital currency would turn out to be.

Dogecoin

The exponential surge in the value of Dogecoin over a period of time speaks volumes as to how good of an investment this meme coin is. Its larger circulation as well as the unlimited capacity to mine more has always been the prime reason for all the attention that Dogecoin enjoys. Yet another point to note is that Dogecoin has a much faster mining/hash rate as compared to Bitcoin, thus making sense to the kind of attention it enjoys.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Crypto-market.jpg',)",none
2021-09-11,AgriNews,Commodity Insight: Stocks and cryptocurrencies poised to get a haircut,https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/opinion/columnists/2021/09/11/commodity-insight-stocks-and-cryptocurrencies-poised-to-get-a-haircut/,"A month ago, veteran investor Mark Mobius, founder partner of Mobius Capital Partners, warned that “crazy market moves” in assets such as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were being driven by “disorientation and confusion.”

He also warned that the Fed could suddenly dial back their stimulus measures and push interest rates higher due to the specter of rising inflation and the impact of the pandemic.

Personally, I have to say there are, indeed, odd market moves underway amid a great deal of “disorientation and confusion.” It is getting crazy for the entire Big Four, stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.

Allow me to illustrate how crazy things are getting, which in turn is leading to confusion. On Aug. 18, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari was quoted as saying: “Cryptocurrencies are 95% fraud, hype, noise and confusion.”

He was quoted by Marketinsider.com as going on to say: “He hadn’t found a sound argument for any practical use for cryptocurrency.

“I was more optimistic about crypto or bitcoin about five or six years ago. So far, what I’ve seen is 99% … let me be charitable, 95% fraud, hype, noise and confusion.”

However, a few days after Kashkari bad-mouthed cryptocurrencies, bitcoin rallied to a new three-month high of $50,280, up from the low of $29,250 posted on July 20. Yes, the leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin, jumped nearly 60% in one month with a Fed governor talking trash about the market — talk about crazy!

But confusing market moves are becoming the norm and not simply with cryptocurrencies. In recent days, cattle futures, not cash cattle, rallied sharply amid questionable fundamentals. December live cattle futures this week rose to a bit over $138, a four-year high while cash cattle were stuck at $122.

Yours truly has been bad-mouthing the cattle market for months, arguing that cattle should not rise over $135, but the market did that with ease this week.

However, here are some words from David Hale’s Cattle Letter posted this week: “We can find no reason for the massive surge in fund/money managers buying the cattle futures today. Full moon was one reason. We thought all the moon traders had passed on, but maybe not? Is there going to be more free money? Interesting to note the strength was concentrated in the front-end today. If the rally in the futures holds, cash will be higher but it definitely is not the leader. For the moment, this market is untradeable.”

Here are a few more pithy comments from Mobius about the market environment in which we live: “A lot of people have cash in hand that they want to do something with, and secondly, a lot of people are confused. The fact that they’ve seen bitcoin, which they had so much faith in, go down the way it’s gone down confuses people.

“So, you have a funny situation with a lot of money in their pocket and lots of confusion and disorientation, so I think that’s what is driving a lot of these crazy moves in the market.”

And the final timely comments from Mobius: You’re going to see a lot of these unusual moves with “some of them justifiable, but a lot of it not justifiable and not logical really,” making for a very uncertain outlook.

“So, at the end of the day, we’re in a very, very uncertain situation. And, of course, that means a recipe for disaster for some people who are investing.”

The comments from Mobius and Hale once again are the reasons I tout my two main rules when investing or speculating in stocks or commodities.

My Rule No. 1 states: No one knows for sure what the markets are going to do. Not for sure, they don’t.

My Rule No. 2 is from that old ancient Chinese saying: “Always use a stop.”

Today, the Fed’s favorite gauge of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, climbed 0.4% in July, and the increase equaled a new 30-year high. It was the fifth increase in a row going back to 1991. And this week also showed new all-time high prices for the Dow, the S&P and solid gains for cryptocurrencies.

In recent weeks I have warned repeatedly that there is rampant speculation underway with stocks, crypto markets and commodities even though consumer confidence has recently fallen to a 20-year low.

Based on the crazy market moves underway coupled with confusion and disorientation, I am expecting the stock market and cryptocurrencies to drop sharply because values are too elevated.

Avoid the long side as both markets should get a haircut sooner than later. And to keep track of my bold predictions, go to commodityinsite.com.","('https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/ZO4UIZYZLVFN5B7J3N54K5GKDI.jpeg',)",none

Bloomberg

The week when Bitcoin joined the ranks of the world’s official currencies was supposed to be a watershed moment for crypto bulls -- and the constellation of publicly traded companies that orbit around it.It didn’t go as expected. The rollout in El Salvador was snared by glitches. Global policymakers issued warnings about cryptocurrency volatility. And Coinbase Global Inc., the largest U.S. exchange for such tokens, said it may be sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, signaling that regulators are poised to crack down on the industry That hit high-flying stocks tied to cryptocurrencies , leaving short-sellers smelling blood and increasing their wagers that the decline was only a preview of what’s to come.“Shorting into a falling market tells us that there is commitment to a winning trade,” said Ihor Dusaniwskiy, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. “They are increasing their bets looking for share prices to decline even more.”As Bitcoin-mining company Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. plunged on Tuesday, sending it toward an 18% loss this week, a gauge of short interest as a proportion of its free-share float calculated by S3 Partners LLC ticked higher, showing bears were increasing negative bets. Traders also increased wagers on further declines for MicroStrategy Inc., Riot Blockchain Inc. and Bit Digital Inc., all of which dropped 14% or more during the holiday-shortened week.JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said some of the retreat could reflect a give-back of gains seen in the runup to El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as an official currency alongside the U.S. dollar.“It could be a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news situation. Now that the rollout has finally happened, a lot of people are saying, ‘What’s next?,” he said. “For those on Wall Street who don’t want to trade Bitcoin itself, a short position on stocks tied to Bitcoin is a way to express their bearish bets.”Some of the moves were exacerbated by company-specific issues beyond the pullback in the volatile cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy’s chief financial and chief technology officers unloaded stock in August after exercising about 30% of the options they were awarded, SEC filings show. That sapped some confidence in the company’s strategy of borrowing heavily to buy Bitcoin, one that has effectively transformed it from a software maker into a leveraged cryptocurrency investment fund.Coinbase’s shares dropped after the company said it received a Wells notice from the SEC, which threatened to bring an enforcement action if Coinbase follows through on a plan to allow customers to earn interest on their crypto holdings. The shares fell 11% through Friday, dropping each trading day for the week for the first time since May.Bitcoin is highly volatile, and even with this week’s dip, it’s still up more than 50% from the low hit in late July. It has also proved resilient after other declines.But some technical patterns signal that Bitcoin may struggle to bounce back much beyond its current level of around $45,700 on Friday.Narrowing Bollinger bands -- a popular technical indicator that highlights volatility -- showed in late August that the Bitcoin rally was flagging and that the virtual currency faces a zone of resistance from $50,000 to $51,000, the range where it topped out earlier this month. A key threshold to watch is the middle line of the Bollinger study at about $46,700.Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., said the $44,000 to $45,000 zone is key for Bitcoin at the moment. If prices steadily rise beyond $47,000, the momentum might give the bulls an all-clear.“Bitcoin seems poised to consolidate following the roller-coaster ride that happened earlier in the week,” Moya said in a note to clients. “Social media platforms are filled with retail traders remaining extremely bullish long-term but cautious over what prices will do next.”","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-86110396,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-192108,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none

2021-09-11,Cointelegraph,Altcoin Roundup: High Ethereum fees kick-start a liquidity migration to layer-1 platforms,https://cointelegraph.com/news/altcoin-roundup-high-ethereum-fees-kick-start-a-liquidity-migration-to-layer-1-platforms,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, the race to establish a highly scalable, user-friendly network capable of being adopted on a global scale is a never-ending marathon where new competitors regularly join in on the race.

Bitcoin is undoubtedly the market leader when it comes to network security, active users and market capitalization value, while Ethereum has thus far established itself as the top smart contracts platform, but the continued difficulty in getting these networks to scale has opened the door for next-generation blockchain protocols to gain a foothold in the market.

The tenuous nature of Ethereum’s reign has begun to come under increased pressure in recent months as several up-and-coming layer-one- and layer-two-based protocols have launched incentive programs to attract liquidity and users to their ecosystems.

Here’s a look at some of the rising layer-one smart contract platforms that are vying for an increased share of liquidity in the crypto market.

Fantom incentivizes developers to migrate

Fantom is a protocol that utilizes a directed acyclic graph architecture to perform its consensus and is, in theory, infinitely scalable based on this design.

The high-speed, low-cost nature of the network has been gaining increased attention from participants in the crypto community in recent months because the Ethereum network continues to suffer from high transaction costs and slower confirmation times due to network congestion.

Activity on the network really began to increase following the Aug. 30 announcement of a 370-million-FTM incentive program aimed at rewarding developers who build new protocols on the Fantom network.

In the time since the launch of the FTM incentive program, the total value locked (TVL) on the Fantom protocol has increased from $691 million to a new record high at $1.44 billion on Sept. 9, based on data from Defi Llama.

According to data provided by the Fantom Foundation, a TVL of $1.44 billion makes Fantom the fourth-largest Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible network on the market and is currently adding more than 20,000 new addresses and processing over 1.5 million transactions on a daily basis.

Multiple new nonfungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are launching on the network, and it’s possible that this trend will continue to rise as liquidity migrates to Fantom.

Liquidity “rushes” to Avalanche

Another network that has been draining liquidity from the Ethereun network is Avalanche, an open, programmable smart contracts platform specifically designed for decentralized applications.

Activity for the protocol saw a significant uptick following the launch of the Avalanche Rush DeFi Incentive Program on Aug. 18, which dedicated $180 million to DeFi protocols and liquidity to the Avalanche ecosystem.

The program initially integrated with Curve and Aave, two of the top DeFi protocols on the Ethereum network, but has since expanded to include other protocols, such as SushiSwap, Benqi Finance, YAY Games, Kyber Network and ParaSwap.

Following the launch of the incentive program, data from Defi Llama shows that the total value locked on the Avalanche protocol surged from $311.5 million on Aug. 18 to an all-time high at $2.42 billion on Sept. 5 before a market-wide pullback dropped its value to $2.11 billion at the time of writing.

Avalanche has also seen a number of new DeFi and NFT protocols launch on the network, including a partnership with the collectible and trading card maker Topps, which launched its “2021 Topps Major League Baseball Inception NFT Collection” on the Avalanche network.

The ongoing migration was made possible by the launch of the Avalanche Bridge in June, and this enabled users to transfer any asset on the Ethereum network to Avalanche at a fifth of the cost previously required through the bridge.

A competitive field gets even more crowded

Fantom and Avalanche are two of the more recent rising stars in the layer-one game that have been siphoning users from the Ethereum network, but they are far from alone.

Other EVM-compatible networks that made headway earlier in the year are the Binance Smart Chain and Polygon. Both networks allow users to keep their assets on the Ethereum network while avoiding the high fees on the base layer.

Top 7 blockchain protocols by total value locked. Source: Defi Llama

The biggest threat posed to Ethereum from a non-EVM-compatible chain comes from Solana, which has seen the biggest gain in TVL over the past seven days, followed by the stablecoin-focused protocol Terra.

Two final notable mentions include the self-amending blockchain protocol Tezos and Algorand, which is a pure proof-of-stake protocol.

Data from Defi Llama shows that each network’s TVL increased by 207% and 71%, respectively, over the past seven days, while their token prices spiked close to their all-time highs thanks to protocol upgrades and, in the case of Algorand, adoption by the government of El Salvador.

As mentioned at the outset and shown in the TVL figure above, the Ethereum network is the dominant smart contract blockchain in terms of users, protocols and TVL, but the current limitations of the network have left the door open for competitors to chip away at its market share.

It remains to be seen whether Ethereum 2.0 will solve the problems faced or if a next-generation protocol will rise to the top and offer the optimal solution to the blockchain trilemma of providing decentralization, security and scalability on one easy-to-use platform.

Officials also asked about how stablecoins should be structured, how they could be used, whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient, and other safety and soundness issues, one of the people said.

Treasury officials also met earlier in the week with a group of banks and credit unions to discuss similar issues, another of the people said. Treasury officials appeared to be gathering information and did not share their thinking on how stablecoins should be regulated, this person added.

The information gathered at this week’s meetings is likely to help shape a broad Treasury report on stablecoins expected in the coming months.

In a statement, Treasury spokesman John Rizzo said the department is examining ""potential benefits and risks of stablecoins for users, markets, or the financial system.""

""As this work continues, the Treasury Department is meeting with a broad range of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, members of Congress and market participants,” he added.

Washington policymakers worry the rise in privately-operated currencies could undermine their control of the financial and monetary systems, increase systemic risks, promote financial crime, and hurt investors.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also working on cryptocurrency projects, they have said.

2021-09-11,Bitcoin News,Lawmaker Presents Bill to Regulate Cryptocurrencies in Panama – Regulation Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/lawmaker-bill-regulate-cryptocurrencies-panama/,"Lawmaker Presents Bill to Regulate Cryptocurrencies in Panama

A Panamanian lawmaker has introduced a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies in the National Assembly. Among the proposals in the bill is the legalization of cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ethereum, as a means of payment, including for paying taxes.

Proposed Crypto Law Will ‘Give Legal Certainty and Safety to Crypto Assets in Panama’

As the Bitcoin Law went into effect in El Salvador making BTC legal tender, Panamanian legislator Gabriel Silva tweeted on Sept. 7, “Today we proposed the Crypto Law.” He elaborated:

We want Panama to be compatible with blockchain, cryptoassets, and the internet. This has the potential to create jobs, attract investment and bring transparency.

The draft law he presented in the National Assembly is titled “Crypto law: Making Panama compatible with the digital economy, blockchain, cryptoassets, and the internet.”

Silva explained that the law “seeks to revolutionize public administration, making it transparent, innovative and also promoting a digital economy that reaches most of the citizens.”

The lawmaker proceeded to outline three key objectives of the bill. The first is “to give legal certainty and safety to crypto assets in Panama, for example, cryptocurrencies,” he described.

The second is to “attract companies and investment and encourage entrepreneurship in Panama that are focused in digital economy,” he added, noting that this will help create jobs.

The third is to “broaden the amount of financial services that are offered in Panama, ensuring better prices for everyone.”

The proposed law also addresses the use of crypto assets in Panama. Article 8 of the bill states: “Natural persons located in the Republic of Panama or legal entities organized in the Republic of Panama may freely agree to use cryptoassets, including without limitation bitcoin and ethereum, as means of payment for any civil or commercial operation not prohibited by the legal system of the Republic of Panama.”

Furthermore, Article 9 addresses the “Possibility of payment of taxes, fees and other tax obligations with cryptoassets.” It reads:

The bodies and entities of the Republic of Panama may receive payments, directly or through payment processors or agents contracted for this purpose, for taxes, fees and other tax obligations in cryptoassets, including without limitation bitcoin and ethereum.

Silva emphasized that “Panama cannot be left behind in technological innovations.” The proposed crypto law can be found here.

2021-09-09,NDTV Gadgets 360,"India to Take Distinctive Approach Toward Cryptocurrencies, Not Like the US or El Salvador",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-india-approach-distinctive-not-like-us-el-salvador-jayant-sinha-2535358,"The government will take a distinctive approach to regulate cryptocurrencies in India that will be different from the western markets, Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance Jayant Sinha said during an online event. The latest comments from the lawmaker come amid uncertainty among Indian stakeholders due to long anticipation of regulation for Bitcoin and other crypto instruments. The country has a strong base of cryptocurrency exchanges and investors, but it so far has not recognised cryptocurrencies as a legal asset or currency.

Speaking at crypto asset conference HODL – 2021, organised by the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) of Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), Sinha said that India would not follow the US, Japan, or El Salvador in its approach toward cryptocurrencies.

“Our solution will have to be distinct and unique for India, simply because of our unique circumstances,” the MP and former Minister of State for Finance said.

He also said that the process of regulating cryptocurrencies would involve “stakeholder consultations”, after getting approvals from the parliament.

“It would be good if we have global standards and then if there is something above and beyond the global standards, that is unique to India, that can also be developed and worked,” Sinha said.

The lawmaker also noted that the country needs to consider legislation on cryptocurrencies that keeps national security concerns in mind.

In late January, the government proposed a bill to prohibit “all private cryptocurrencies” in the country and develop a framework for creating an official digital currency issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Just a couple of days after that bill got listed on the Lok Sabha bulletin, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur said while responding to a question raised in Rajya Sabha by saying that the government “does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coins”. He also underlined that the government would take all measures to eliminate use of crypto assets in financing illegal activities or as part of the payment system.

Those two major activities, along with an earlier RBI's ban on cryptocurrencies that was quashed by the Supreme Court last year, raised concerns among investors in the country.

However, major cryptocurrency stakeholders are optimistic and consider the fresh comments from Sinha as an indication of a positive move by the government.

“We agree with what Mr. Sinha mentioned,” said Avinash Shekhar, Co-CEO of Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange ZebPay. “India has its own unique strengths and issues when it comes to implementing laws and regulations around crypto and we're looking forward to a regulatory framework that matches these unique needs.”

Shekhar moderated the session with Sinha during the online conference. He expressed the need for an open discussion to address the government's concerns.

Nischal Shetty, CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, said the demand for cryptocurrencies had been steadily rising in the country and the move by the government could be a significant boost to the crypto ecosystem as a whole.

“We are optimistic and look forward to working closely with the government in regulating crypto in a manner that fosters innovation. We further hope that the government consults with the industry players and takes into consideration their recommendations before finalising on the bill,” he said.

Sharan Nair, Chief Business Officer of Bengaluru-based cryptocurrency trading platform CoinSwitch Kuber, also agreed to the comments made by Sinha.

“The laws around crypto can't simply be replicated from how other countries treat crypto,” he said. “In this process, crypto exchanges like CoinSwitch Kuber are more than willing to work alongside the regulators and policymakers to define laws that keep the nation's interest in mind.”

Similar to Indian cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms, global players in the cryptocurrency market are also seeing the country with a massive potential to help grow digital currencies around the world.

“Once we have the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in place, the industry will be well-poised for growth,” said Vincent Lau, Managing Director of International Operations, Seychelles-based Huobi Global. “We will continue to evolve our operations to meet the requirements of India's regulatory environment as part of our global expansion strategy.”

Market analysts believe that while it is difficult to come to a judgement simply from the comments made by the legislator, the government appears to be emphasising on a delayed approach to play safe in the field of cryptocurrencies.

“India's hesitation to welcome cryptos is understandable and it will be some time before it becomes widely accepted,” said Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst at brokerage firm ThinkMarkets that is based in London and Melbourne.

He added that Sinha merely underlined some of the known challenges that India would face with adopting cryptocurrencies, including issues over governance, taxation and national security.

Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst at New York-based multi-asset trading firm OANDA, said that India had too much resistance that it would not be one of the first adopters of Bitcoin.

“India is taking a cautious approach to cryptocurrencies and will be unable to create their own since they don't have full capital account convertibility. India has gone from banning cryptos to slowly trying to figure out how they can make it work for them,” he noted.

Rajya Sabha Member Amar Patnaik, who is also a part of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance led by Sinha, stressed on the need for a strong regulatory framework for crypto assets in the country.

“The priority should be to put in a regulatory and innovation sandbox both in SEBI (Security Exchange Board of India) and RBI and see prototype wise how it can marry with the Indian system,” Patnaik said during his session at the conference.

According to various reports, India is said to have about 15 million investors in cryptocurrencies and that number is growing steadily.

Globally, a report by Fortune Business Insights suggests that the cryptocurrency market will grow at 11.2 percent to $1,758 million (roughly Rs. 12,900 crores) by 2027.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_ether_stock_unsplash_1629707389109.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrency prices continue to be in the red on September 8. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $2.o5 trillion, a 10.25 percent decrease over the last day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $244.82 billion, which makes a 51.81 percent increase.

The volume of all stable coins is now $195.51 billion – 79.86 percent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. Bitcoin's price is currently $46,309.44 and its dominance is currently 42.32 percent, an increase of 0.30 percent over the day.

This comes after El Salvador bought its first 200 bitcoins, President Nayib Bukele said on Monday, an announcement that sent the price of the cryptocurrency rising one day before the country formally adopts it as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.

Ahead of the launch, El Salvador bought 400 bitcoins worth around $20 million, Bukele said, helping drive the price of the currency above $52,000 for the first time since May. Hours later, however, bitcoin had weakened and last traded down 10.19% at $47,222.02.

Coinbase said some transactions were delayed or canceled at ""elevated rates"" and that ""our apps may be experiencing errors."" The exchange later said issues with Coinbase card swipes were resolved and that transactions were going through normally.

The Gemini exchange said it temporarily entered a full-maintenance period to address an exchange-related issue that caused performance trouble.

Coinbase shares slid 4.02 percent.

Anything related to cryptocurrencies appeared to suffer. Cryptocurrency miners Riot Blockchain fell 7.38 percent and Marathon Digital Holdings slipped 7.76 percent.

Shares of MicroStrategy, a BTC buyer and business intelligence software firm, fell 7.64 percent.

The price of bitcoin has plunged in minutes, wiping billions of dollars off the market.

The volatile cryptocurrency dropped from (USD) $50,257 to $43,351, before recovering some ground.

At 6am this morning it was trading at $47,048, having given up 9.11% in the past 24 hours.

The massive price crash came as El Salvador became the first country to introduce bitcoin as legal tender.

The price of bitcoin crashed overnight.

Other cryptos including ethereum have also suffered heavy losses.

“Horrible, horrible chart damage being done in $BTC and the rest of the #crypto market,” crypto trader and author Glen Goodman wrote on Twitter.

Trader and analyst Scott Melker blamed large-volume traders for bitcoin’s plunge.

“Leave it to whales to dump Bitcoin on the day that El Salvador makes it legal tender,” he wrote.

Economist Peter Schiff wrote: “Welcome to #Bitcoin #ElSalvador.

“Your national ‘currency’ just lost over 15% of its purchasing power in under an hour. Get used to it. Just another perfectly orchestrated pump-and-dump by the Bitcoin whales. Too bad this time they had to sacrifice an entire nation to pull it off.”

The plunge wiped billions off the overall market, which is worth about $2.35 trillion.

El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, wrote he would be “buying the dip.”

The plunge was also caused by centralised exchanges liquidating more than $3 billion in long positions.

Liquidations often happen when trades cannot fulfill margin requirements for holding long or short positions, which can exacerbate market drops.

It “looks like it was a standard de-leveraging event,” Rahul Rai from crypto investment firm BlockTower Capital told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin becomes legal tender in El Salvador

Salvadoran consumers can now legally use bitcoin — along with the US dollar which has been the official currency for two decades — to pay for any good or service.

The rollout has been met by much scepticism and fear over the effect of currency volatility on the small Central American country’s ailing economy, and hundreds have taken part in anti-bitcoin protests.

Remittances account for a fifth of El Salvador’s GDP — over $5.9 billion in 2020 — and are vital to revive an economy that contracted 7.9 per cent in 2020 due in large part to the coronavirus pandemic.

Thousands of Salvadorans were already using bitcoin before Tuesday — many of them in the coastal town of El Zonte, where hundreds of businesses and individuals rely on the cyber currency for everything from paying utilities bills to buying a can of soft drink.

Mike Petersen, director of the El Zonte Bitcoin Beach project, said the cryptocurrency had changed the lives of locals.

“They are now able to do online payments, they are able to send money back and forth with family members even hundreds of miles away,” he said.

2021-09-07,The Guardian,"The disastrous voyage of Satoshi, the world’s first cryptocurrency cruise ship",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/sep/07/disastrous-voyage-satoshi-cryptocurrency-cruise-ship-seassteading,"On the evening of 7 December 2010, in a hushed San Francisco auditorium, former Google engineer Patri Friedman sketched out the future of humanity. The event was hosted by the Thiel Foundation, established four years earlier by the arch-libertarian PayPal founder Peter Thiel to “defend and promote freedom in all its dimensions”. From behind a large lectern, Friedman – grandson of Milton Friedman, one of the most influential free-market economists of the last century – laid out his plan. He wanted to transform how and where we live, to abandon life on land and all our decrepit assumptions about the nature of society. He wanted, quite simply, to start a new city in the middle of the ocean.

Friedman called it seasteading: “Homesteading the high seas,” a phrase borrowed from Wayne Gramlich, a software engineer with whom he’d founded the Seasteading Institute in 2008, helped by a $500,000 donation from Thiel. In a four-minute vision-dump, Friedman explained his rationale. Why, he asked, in one of the most advanced countries in the world, were they still using systems of government from 1787? (“If you drove a car from 1787, it would be a horse,” he pointed out.) Government, he believed, needed an upgrade, like a software update for a phone. “Let’s think of government as an industry, where countries are firms and citizens are customers!” he declared.

The difficulty in starting a new form of government, said Friedman, was simply a lack of space. All the land on Earth was taken. What they needed was a new frontier, and that frontier was the ocean. “Let a thousand nations bloom on the high seas,” he proclaimed, with Maoish zeal. He wanted seasteading experiments to start as soon as possible. Within three to six years, he imagined ships being repurposed as floating medical clinics. Within 10 years, he predicted, small communities would be permanently based on platforms out at sea. In a few decades, he hoped there would be floating cities “with millions of people pioneering different ways of living together”.

Politics would be rewritten. The beauty of seasteading was that it offered its inhabitants total freedom and choice. In 2017, Friedman and the “seavangelist” Joe Quirk wrote a book, Seasteading, in which they described how a seasteading community could constantly rearrange itself according to the choices of those who owned the individual floating units. (Quirk now runs the Seasteading Institute; Friedman remains chair of the board.) “Democracy,” the two men wrote, “would be upgraded to a system whereby the smallest minorities, including the individual, could vote with their houses.”

In the decade following Friedman’s talk, a variety of attempts to realise his seasteading vision were all thwarted. “Seavilization,” to use his phrase, remained a fantasy. Then, in October 2020, it seemed his dream might finally come true, when three seasteading enthusiasts bought a 245-metre-long cruise ship called the Pacific Dawn. Grant Romundt, Rüdiger Koch and Chad Elwartowski planned to sail the ship to Panama, where they were based, and park it permanently off the coastline as the centrepiece of a new society trading only in cryptocurrencies. In homage to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of bitcoin’s mysterious inventor (or inventors), they renamed the ship the MS Satoshi. They hoped it would become home to people just like them: digital nomads, startup founders and early bitcoin adopters.

Their vision was utopian, if your idea of utopia is a floating crypto-community in the Caribbean Sea. No longer was seasteading a futuristic ideal; it was, said Romundt, “an actual ship”. The Satoshi also offered a chance to marry two movements, of crypto-devotees and seasteaders, united by their desire for freedom – from convention, regulation, tax. Freedom from the state in all its forms. But converting a cruise ship into a new society proved more challenging than envisaged. The high seas, while appearing borderless and free, are, in fact, some of the most tightly regulated places on Earth. The cruise ship industry in particular is bound by intricate rules. As Romundt put it: “We were like, ‘This is just so hard.’”

As with many stories about techno-libertarian fantasies, the tale of the Satoshi begins in an all-male, quasi-frat house in San Francisco in the late 90s. Romundt – a softly spoken Canadian with the optimistic, healthy glow of someone who combines entrepreneurial success with water sports – was living with a bunch of software engineers, all of whom shared an intense dedication to personal improvement. “I was a huge Tony Robbins fan,” Romundt told me in one of several Zoom calls from his office in Panama. (Robbins’ themes of individual freedom, self-mastery and the accrual of significant wealth are evident from the titles of his books from that time: Unlimited Power; Lessons in Mastery; Unleash the Power Within; The Power to Shape Your Destiny, and, next level, Awaken the Giant Within.)

After his San Francisco stint, Romundt, the son of a hairdresser, created ScissorBoy in 2009, a popular online TV series on hairdressing, and then ScheduleBox, a website which offered a digital receptionist service for hairstylists to book in their clients. (Always digitally inclined, he had, according to his website, the world’s “most advanced mobile paperless office in 1995”.) “I used to work 17 hours a day, so I didn’t have a lot of freedom,” he told me. He did, however, make enough money to semi-retire in 2016 and then spent “no more than five hours a month” running his business. The giant fully awakened, he moved back to Canada, where he lived on a houseboat on Lake Ontario and went kayaking in the mornings as the sun came up. Enraptured by his lifestyle, Romundt wondered why everyone wasn’t living this way. On a flight one day, he saw a man wearing a T-shirt with “Stop arguing. Start seasteading” printed on it. Romundt was curious, they got talking, and the man turned out to be Joe Quirk, who was by this time running the Seasteading Institute.

So far, the Seasteading Institute had experienced variable, or zero, success with its projects. Early ideas for a “Baystead” and “Coaststead” off the coast of San Francisco and a “Clubstead”, a resort off the coast of California, never made the leap to reality. An attempt to create a floating island prototype in French Polynesia in 2017 met with fairly fierce resistance from the people of French Polynesia and collapsed a year later when the government pulled out of the scheme.

After meeting Quirk, Romundt decided he wanted to try again. Quirk introduced him to two other aspiring seasteaders, the passionately libertarian American Elwartowski and the bitcoin-wealthy German engineer Koch. Together, the trio founded a company, Ocean Builders. Using their own money, they funded the first attempt at a single residential seastead, in the form of a floating white octagonal box 12 nautical miles off the coast of Thailand. Elwartowski and his girlfriend, Nadia Summergirl, lived there for two months in early 2018, until the Thai government discovered the seastead’s existence and declared it a threat to the country’s independence, possibly punishable by life imprisonment or death. Elwartowski and Summergirl had to flee the country before the Thai navy dispatched three ships to dismantle the floating box.

The seasteading movement did not die there. In 2019, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski moved their company to Panama, where they had found a government willing to back their next project: the SeaPod. These would be individual floating homes held 3 metres above the water by a single column and a tripod-shaped base beneath the ocean. The man responsible for their design, Koen Olthuis, is a Dutch “aquatect”, an architect specialising in water-based schemes. In rendered drawings, the SeaPods look fantastical, like a giant’s white helmet emerging monstrously from the waves. Inside, every surface is curved, as if you were living within the smooth, colourless confines of a peppermint. Romundt compared the SeaPods to the architecture in The Jetsons, the 60s cartoon where the characters lived in glassy orbs in the sky. “It’s like that,” he told me, “but on water.” The team built a factory from scratch in Linton Bay, a marina on the north coast of Panama, hired a team of about 30 engineers and mechanics, and, in early 2020, began building the first SeaPod prototype.

Progress was slow. Even once they had a successful prototype, Romundt predicted the factory would only make two SeaPods a month. They’d had the idea before of buying a cruise ship – a quick way of scaling up the community – but the cost had always been prohibitive. By autumn 2020, though, the situation had changed. Like many parts of the travel industry, the cruise ship business was collapsing because of the pandemic: multiple cruise lines were going into administration, empty ships filling up ports like abandoned cars in a scrubby field, or being sent to the scrapyard. Cruise ships, the Ocean Builders trio realised, would be going cheap.

Sure enough, they found a bargain. In October 2020, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski bought the ex-P&O cruise ship Pacific Dawn for a reported $9.5m. (Built in 1991 for $280m, the ship could have sold pre-pandemic for more than $100m, one industry insider told me.) They instructed Olthuis to draw up the plans, placing the ship at the heart of a floating community surrounded by SeaPods. “We had a kind of funny idea,” Olthuis told me. In his scheme, the Satoshi would connect, via two looping tunnels on the water, to human-made floating platforms designated for agriculture, manufacturing and parkland. From the air, the whole community would form the shape of the bitcoin B.

The scheme had the support of the Panama government. In fact, the Ministry of Tourism hoped that a new ocean community would be a draw for visitors. In a page-long statement, the ministry told me how a floating development fitted in with its Sustainable Tourism Masterplan 2020-2025, by highlighting the country’s biodiversity and “the blue heritage of Panama”. It didn’t seem to mind the idea of a load of crypto-investors floating off their coastline, not paying any tax.

“Out of adversity comes opportunity, so they say,” wrote Elwartowski, on 10 October 2020, introducing Viva Vivas, the new company that he had created to run the Satoshi. Its name was adapted from the Latin phrase, “vive ut vivas”, meaning “live so that you may live”.

Ten days later, he announced the venture on Reddit: “So, I am buying a cruise ship and naming it MS Satoshi … AMA.” The responses were quick (“Need an apprentice aviation mechanic?” “I know how to use a yo-yo! Any room for me??”) and included the inevitable sceptics. (“Anyone remember the good old days of the Fyre festival?”) But plenty took the proposition seriously and wanted to go over the small print. (“Where is power coming from? Gas? Internet? Food? Water? Toiletries? What taxes will she be subject to?”)

Elwartowski answered every question with grave attention to detail. There would be generators at first, followed quickly by solar power. This would be an eco-friendly crypto-ship. High-speed wireless internet would come from land; utilities would be included in the fees at first, but would be metered when the systems were upgraded: “You don’t want to have pay for someone else’s mining rig in their cabin,” he wrote, referring to the resource-intensive computational process that introduces new crypto “coins” into the system. As for tax, you would not pay any on earnings made from ventures based in territory beyond Panama. You would be free to make, or mine, as much money as you liked. It would be a remote worker’s regulatory paradise.

But as the Reddit Q&A continued, Elwartowski’s meticulous responses revealed some of the more knotty practicalities of life on board. It turned out that the only cooking facilities would be in the restaurant. For safety reasons, no one was allowed to have a microwave in their rooms – though some cabins had mini-fridges, noted Elwartowski, determinedly sidestepping the point. He offered residents a 20% discount at the restaurant and mentioned that some interested cruisers had already talked about renting part of the restaurant kitchen so they could make their own food. “We want entrepreneurs to come up with solutions and try them out,” he wrote, in a valiant attempt to convert a fairly fundamental stumbling block into wild startup energy. “This is your place to try new things.” Not all the Redditors were convinced. “No microwave but mining rig. Incoherent scam.”

Marketing of the Satoshi soon began in earnest. Her 777 cabins were to be auctioned off between 5 and 28 November, while the ship was crossing the Atlantic towards Panama. Viva Vivas listed the options, including cabins with no windows ($570 a month), an ocean view ($629), or a balcony ($719). Ocean Builders held a series of live video calls for potential customers which attracted 200 people at a time, Olthuis told me, with Romundt, an expert steward of the multilateral video call, at the helm.

On the Viva Vivas website, a Frequently Asked Questions page covered the basics of the cabin auction process, fees and logistics. Specially trained staff would be hired to keep the ship Covid-free and through a partnership with a platform called coinpayments.net, multiple cryptocurrencies would be supported for payment, including bitcoin, ethereum, digibyte, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dai, dash, ethereum classic, trueUSD, USD coin, tether, bitcoin SV, electroneum, cloak, doge, eureka coin, xem and monero.

The final entry on the FAQ page, regarding the possibility of having pets on board, gave a bracing insight into the tension between the idea of freedom and the reality of hundreds of people closely cohabiting on a cruise ship. The answer linked to a separate document, containing a 14-point list of conditions including one that declared no animal should exceed 20lbs in weight, and any barking or loud noises could not last for longer than 10 minutes. If a pet repeatedly disturbed the peace – more than three times a month or five times in a year – it would no longer be allowed to live on board. “Any pet related conflict,” instructed point 13, “shall be resolved in accordance with Section V (F) of the Satoshi Purchase Agreement or Section IV (F) of the Satoshi Master Lease, where applicable.” Dogs would only be permitted in balcony cabins, and it was advised that owners buy a specific brand of “porch potty”, a basket of fake grass where your pet could relieve itself. (Pet waste thrown overboard would result in a $200 fine.)

One Reddit respondent – maxcoiner on Reddit, Luke Parker in real life – was as close to the target market of the Satoshi as it was possible to imagine. A longtime follower of the seasteading movement, he was also such an early and successful bitcoin adopter that he and his wife were able to retire early thanks to their investments. The Satoshi was the most plausible idea for a seastead he’d ever heard. “I did not buy a room during the Satoshi’s sale window,” he told me over email, “but it was hard to keep my hand off that button.”

A variety of considerations held him back. “The wife,” as he put it, had her doubts. He wasn’t sure about the “ginormous leap down in luxury” from living in deep residential comfort on land in the US midwest to living in a very small cabin on board a 30-year-old cruise ship. He was worried, too, by the limited facilities – “No kitchen of my own? Tiny bathrooms? Tiny everything?” Also, the constant rocking of the ship on the water: “I just can’t stomach that life around the clock.” He preferred the idea of the SeaPods. If Parker was going to live on a boat, he concluded, he’d prefer to buy his own luxury catamaran.

On 29 November, Elwartowski published another post on the Viva Vivas website, announcing the official opening of the Satoshi in January 2021. “This will be a new experience for all of us so we must manage your expectations,” he warned. The novelty was too much for Parker. “It takes a rare kind of person indeed to move your life on to a deserted cruise ship in Central America with so little information up front,” he told me. If Parker, part of that highly select, freedom-seeking, system-abandoning, overlapping community of seasteaders and bitcoiners, wasn’t going to buy, it was hard to imagine who would. As he put it: “This may have been the smallest sales demographic in history.”

Over 30 years of service, the Satoshi herself had seen enough of the world to know every permutation of life at sea – apart, perhaps from what it might be like to be a permanent home to 2,000 crypto-investors. Built in 1991 in the Fincantieri shipyard in Trieste, Italy, she is one of only two cruise ships designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. (The other, the Crown Princess, was sent to the scrapyard last year, a Covid casualty.) Her first incarnation was as the Regal Princess (owned by Princess Cruises), after which she became the Pacific Dawn (P&O Australia). Throughout her life, she has been admired for her distinctive features: a domed roof rising above the navigation bridge, water slides that curl round her funnel and a stern whose elegantly rounded form is in marked contrast to the blunt, sawn-off rears of some giant cruise liners. Those who prefer an understated cruising experience also appreciate her discreet size: compared to the largest cruise ship in the world, The Symphony of the Seas (18 decks, 23 swimming pools) she is a modest vessel (11 decks, two swimming pools).

For many years, the Pacific Dawn cruised the south Pacific, enjoying a serene phase of life, interrupted only by an onboard swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the time she lost power and came within 70 metres of crashing into the Gateway Bridge on the Brisbane River. In 2011, a devoted Facebook group was established by fans. “Dawnie was the party ship,” remembered one. “I fell in love with my wife all over again,” added another, crediting the ship for his romantic renewal. Then, in 2020, it briefly looked as though Dawnie was set to join her sister on the scrapyard, after her sale to British cruise company, Cruise and Maritime Voyages, collapsed in the pandemic. Her fans were grief-stricken, weeping emojis piling up on the Facebook group. (“Well 2020 just became even shittier,” said Kathie.) When it was revealed that the ship had been rescued by Ocean Builders, there was a wave of relief, if a little mystification at her new name. “She’ll always be Dawn to me.”

On 29 October 2020, Dawn began her journey to Panama, sailing from Limassol, Cyprus to Piraeus, Greece. A week later, she was handed over to her new owners Ocean Builders and officially became the Satoshi. Koch flew over from Panama to cross the Atlantic aboard their new purchase. The team hired a management company, Columbia Cruise Services, to run the ship and provide a minimum crew of about 40 people, mostly Ukrainian, including a cook, engineers and cleaning staff. A seasoned British cruise captain, Peter Harris, arrived to take charge. “We didn’t know anything about running a cruise,” Romundt told me, “so it was like, we didn’t want to have to figure all this stuff out.”

As soon as Capt Harris joined the ship and met Koch on board, he realised there would be challenges ahead. “I was thinking a week into the job, I can see I’m going to be resigning,” Harris told me, immaculate in a striped shirt on a video call from his home in Kent. Koch, he said, was admirable in his ambition, and a likable, law-abiding man, but he was naive about how shipping worked and had an abhorrence of rules. “He didn’t understand the industry,” said Harris, who has the frank, upbeat air of a born leader for whom hierarchy is a kind of creed. “He just thought he could treat it like his own yacht.”

To sail anywhere, Harris explained, a ship requires certificates of seaworthiness. These expired on the day the deal with P&O was completed. Usually, a new buyer would ensure they lasted a couple of months to cover any onward journey, but no one on the Ocean Builders side had checked. By the time Columbia Cruise Services came on board and informed the team of the situation, the contracts had all been signed. Before the Satoshi could cross the Atlantic, the team were obliged to sail the ship to Gibraltar and have her removed from the water, a process known as dry-docking, to perform essential repairs and renew the certificates.

The Atlantic crossing began on 3 December. Harris – who didn’t resign, grateful for the four-month contract mid-pandemic – found it oddly lovely. With only 40 or so people on board, rather than the usual 2,000-odd, the atmosphere was relaxed, if a little surreal. Among other things, P&O had left about 5,000 bottles of wine and 2,000 bottles of spirits on board. Harris asked Koch if he wanted to charge the crew for drinks, but Koch, generous by nature, said no. “Obviously, we restricted them to three drinks a day,” said Harris. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had a crew.”

As the crossing continued, questions about how the project would actually work once the Satoshi arrived in Panama grew more pressing. According to Harris, Elwartowski thought he could convince the Panamanian authorities to let the ship anchor permanently in its waters and de-register as a ship, becoming a floating residence instead, so as to avoid some of the more exacting requirements of maritime law. But while Panama was happy to have the ship moored off its coast, it specified that the ship had to remain officially designated as a ship. Which led to another difficulty: the discharge of sewage. Though the ship had an advanced wastewater management system, which could turn sewage into drinking-quality water, they were not permitted to discharge this wastewater into Panamanian waters, and so would have had to sail 12 miles out every 20 days or so to empty tanks into international waters.

Such obstacles made the ship an off-putting proposition for insurers. No one would agree to cover them. “They wouldn’t even tell us why we weren’t insurable, they just kept saying no,” Romundt said. “It’s kind of hard to remedy something if you don’t know what the problem is.” Of the several insurance experts I asked about this, none were willing to comment on the case, citing a lack of expertise, presumably because no one had ever tried to insure a cruise ship turned floating crypto-community before. Harris, however, had his theories: that a risk-averse insurance industry was wary of both a bitcoin business and a ship that would presumably be mostly populated by quick-to-litigate Americans.

After trying multiple insurers and brokers, Romundt began to realise that the cruise ship industry was, as he put it, “plagued by over-regulation”. (Along with airlines and nuclear power, according to Harris, it’s in “the top three”.) The Ocean Builders’ great freedom project, whose intrinsic purpose was to offer an escape from oppressive rules and bureaucracy, was being hobbled by oppressive rules and bureaucracy. As Elwartowski would reflect a few months later on Reddit: “A cruise ship is not very good for people who want to be free.”

To Romundt, the whole cruise ship business began to seem like an impenetrable old boys’ network. He estimated that, given six months, they could have hired a crack marine legal team and navigated a way through the loopholes. But by mid-December, the Satoshi was already halfway across the Atlantic, burning through gallons of diesel, with a 40-person crew they’d have to keep on board even when she was stationary in Panama because a cruise ship requires constant maintenance. A ship can cost, even when docked, up to $1m a month to run. “Because, you know,” said Romundt, “it’s huge.”

Fuel alone was costing the Ocean Builders trio about $12,000 a day. According to Harris, Koch wanted to try to make the ship more fuel-efficient by installing a smaller engine, which he thought he could do while the ship was at anchor. “We were like, how are you going to cut a hole in the ship’s side big enough to get the engine out, which is below water level, and not sink the ship?” Harris shook his head, his memories of Koch clearly fond, if perplexed. “I was forever saying, ‘No, Rudi you can’t do this; no, Rudi you can’t do that.’”

Before the Satoshi hove into view of the white sands of a Panama beach, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski had to make a call. They couldn’t afford to keep the ship moored and empty for months on end while they tried to solve the insurance problem, a problem they weren’t even sure they’d be able to solve. They were insured to sail her, and they could go on sailing her, but they didn’t want to run a travel company. They wanted to run a floating society of like-minded freedom-lovers arranged in the shape of the bitcoin B. It wasn’t even clear that there were enough people who wanted to do that. Koch admitted to Harris that the cabins weren’t selling.

“It was almost like a fantasy, James Bond-ish,” said one cruise industry insider. “But to their credit they believed in it.”

The dream was over, they realised, before it had even begun. The project was dead, except it wasn’t quite, as they still owned the ship, which was still steaming across the Atlantic with Koch, Harris and the crew on board. The Satoshi, already thousands of miles into a 5,500-nautical-mile voyage, had travelled too far to be turned around mid-ocean, so on she sailed. They’d have to sell her, the Ocean Builders realised, but who was going to be crazy enough to buy a cruise ship in the middle of a pandemic? Only a company who wanted to tear her apart. On 18 December, while she was still at sea, the team announced the sale of the Satoshi to a scrapyard in Alang, India. The Satoshi was once again destined for dismemberment.

On 19 December, Elwartowski announced on the Viva Vivas website that the Satoshi’s journey was coming to an end. “We have lost this round. The New Normal, Great Reset gains another victim,” he wrote, looping in the collapse of the Satoshi with a popular Covid conspiracy theory that the pandemic and its response had been stage-managed by a global elite. (Over subsequent months, Elwartowski’s activity on Reddit would include other Covid themes, including suspicion of government vaccination programmes.) Romundt emailed their list of potential customers to let them know the ship’s fate. Deposits for cabins would be refunded.

The Satoshi arrived in Balboa, Panama on 22 December. On Christmas Eve, she anchored off the coast of Colon. There, Romundt joined Koch and the crew on the ship. Elwartowski, meanwhile, stayed in Panama City. “He didn’t want to get on board,” said Romundt. Koch spoke to Joe Quirk one evening on the phone while he was sitting in the ship’s cafe drinking a bottle of wine, feeling regretful that the onboard hospital he’d planned to open to medical entrepreneurs would never come to life. Even so, Koch was “utterly unbowed”, reported Quirk in a Seasteading Institute blog post entitled How the Grinch Stole the Cruise Ship.

Romundt, a man more driven by the practical issues at hand than the romantic symbolism of his endeavours, realised that, though the entire plan had fallen apart, he was still the part-owner of a massive cruise ship. He decided to spend Christmas on board, along with the crew. Master key in hand, he wandered around the Satoshi, making sure to enter every room that said Do Not Enter. He toured the engine room, and sat on the sun deck. He worked, because he can’t help working, even at Christmas, but he also went on all the water slides, alone. (Harris told me he’d turned them on specially for Christmas Day.) Though Romundt doesn’t usually drink, he had a glass of wine and called all his friends saying, “I’m on my own cruise ship for Christmas!” He had the kind of good time it is perhaps only possible to have when you have just made an unbelievably expensive mistake born of a desire to invent an entirely new way of living and involving the purchase of a huge floating vessel. “I was king of the ship!” he said, still delighted.

Even scrapping the Satoshi proved to be a debacle. After a deal had been done with the Indian scrapyard, the Ocean Builders team realised that according to the Basel Convention, which covers the disposal of hazardous waste, they weren’t allowed to send the ship from a signatory country (Panama) to a non-signatory country (India). The contract with the scrapyard had to be cancelled.

All was not completely lost, at least for the Satoshi herself. The cruise ship industry is a compact ecosystem. The grapevine did its thing. A ship broker heard about the plight of the Satoshi, realised it was precisely the kind of ship a new client of his was looking for, and did a quick deal.

The client was Ambassador Cruise Line, the first British cruise company to launch for 10 years. According to Ambassador’s ebullient, red-sweatered chair, Gordon Wilson, the company’s name is intended to reflect the highly optimistic idea that ambassadors, like cruise ships, take the best of their own culture with them wherever they go. The Satoshi would be the first ship in the company’s new fleet, which would offer cruises to the over-50s. Many of the new team at Ambassador had come over from Cruise and Maritime Voyages, who had nearly bought the Satoshi before it went bust in 2020. As such, they knew the ship well, which sped up the sale. Wilson wouldn’t confirm the amount – “they thought it was a good price” – but the trade press reported that Ocean Builders sold her for $12m, more than they paid for her, though possibly not quite enough to cover the elaborate costs of running an empty cruise ship for three months.

On 23 February 2021, the Satoshi set sail from Panama, heading all the way back across the ocean she’d just crossed. She arrived in Bar, Montenegro on 27 March. Wilson went over to visit her, and, like Romundt, relished the experience of climbing aboard his new asset. Exploring the engine rooms of an empty cruise ship seemed to give these men a particular sensation: perhaps just the buzz of owning something so vast and powerful; a mechanical, proprietary thrill.

The Ocean Builders team, meanwhile, returned to their own private missions. Elwartowski was on sabbatical, Romundt told me. He did not want to talk to me for this story. Koch, who also declined to be interviewed, was building his own boat in Panama, and working with Romundt on the SeaPods. Over Zoom, Romundt gave me a tour of the SeaPod factory, and showed off the hulking sheets of fibreglass that would form the structure’s mould. “It feels like touching a UFO,” he said, stroking his invention.

Seeing the pod’s nascent form, I felt a boringly pragmatic urge to ask Romundt what happened if, once afloat, you needed to buy a pint of milk. My question seemed to miss the point, too wedded to old-fashioned notions of locality and human connection. The Pods had been designed to have a hatch in the roof, Romundt said. He was talking to some drone creators and imagined people flying to their pods independently, landing on the roof and entering through the hatch. Perhaps that’s how you’d get your milk.

At her new home in Montenegro, meanwhile, the Satoshi needed some sprucing up. For the fourth time in her three decades on the water, she had been renamed. “We thought Ambience a lovely name for a ship,” said Wilson, pronouncing it in the French style, Ambi-ence. “This is a very elegant ship,” he added, proudly. “She looks like a cruise liner; she does not look like a floating block of flats.”

When Ambience finally sets sail on her maiden voyage, from the industrial dock of Tilbury across the North Sea to Hamburg in April 2022, she will offer a more traditional experience to her passengers. “Back to what cruising is all about,” said Wilson. The atmosphere will be refined. There will be promenading on deck and plentiful opportunities for photography as the horizon swallows the evening sun. There will be cocktails at the bar, a five-course dinner and a glittery show. It is unlikely bitcoin will be accepted as currency. The water slides will be removed.

This article was amended on 8 September 2021 to include the full name of Ambassador Cruise Line, and to clarify that the Ambience’s dinners will have five courses, not three.","('https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9a64a665016b5916e57cfc3c43ff4dada669f8e/0_261_2750_1649/master/2750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa6a88e32b4f67b2d8a4e4fec1f44c1c',)",none

Highlights Cryptocurrency: Investors are treating them for long-time investment

Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency: Coin has earned a high mining rate since its inception

Cryptocurrency is barely a speculative investment these days. Retail and institutional investors are taking the digital assets very seriously. With so much going around the digital currency, investors are treating them as useful for not only short-term profits but also for long-time investment. But which ones should you choose to invest in? To make it easier for you, we discuss some crypto coins that have been topping the market cap charts time and again. Considering their relative stability, these could be good choices for a long-term investment. (Also Read: Meet ""The Jedi Master Of Crypto"": He Has Also Invested In Indian Start-Up)

Below are details about come cryptocurrencies:

1) Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency. Its valuation is increasing as more investors are endorsing this ‘digital gold'. The most vital factor behind its prized value is the maximum limit of its coins: 21 million.

2) Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum or ether is almost always in competition with Bitcoin, Ethereum or ether. Its share in the crypto market recently rose from 18 per cent to 20 per cent. It is a decentralised blockchain platform that cuts out third parties.

3) Cardano (ADA)

Cardano is also a decentralised blockchain platform that uses a native cryptocurrency. It enables secure peer-to-peer transactions. There are plans to enable smart contracts on it very soon.

4) Uniswap (UNI)

This currency already allows the use of smart contracts. It facilitates automated transactions with tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

5) Dogecoin (DOGE)

The coin has earned a high mining rate since its inception. It's still on the speculative stage and hasn't crossed the dollar mark. However, it has a larger circulation and unlimited capacity to mine more.

6) Binance Coin (BNB)

Like Bitcoin, it has a limit on the number of tokens that it circulates: 200 million coins. It also follows a quarterly routine of destroying or ""burning"" much of its currency around the year. These are major reasons for its soaring value.

7) Polkadot (DOT)

This currency provides a bridge for networks so that many applications built on Polkadot can also work on Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, it is more scalable and faster.

Highlights Simon Seojoon Kim started investing in Ether in 2015

By end of March 2017, Kim had put in close to $400,000

The 36-year-old entrepreneur is a software developer by trade

As Simon Seojoon Kim tells it, he started investing in Ether, the coin that fuels the Ethereum network, back in the year it started -- 2015. (Also Read: Which Is The Best Cryptocurrency For Long-Term Investment? Find Out)

His friends told him he was crazy as he ploughed a big part of his life savings into the new cryptocurrency. By the end of March 2017, he'd put in close to $400,000.

Then Ether began to climb.

While Kim's investments are hard to verify, one thing is beyond dispute: Ether has surged in value compared to the start of 2017. In the past year, it's up more than 10-fold. And Kim, meanwhile, has become one of South Korea's most famous blockchain advocates. After raising a first blockchain fund in December, he's planning a second one this month.

""He is like Yoda, the Jedi Master of cryptocurrency,"" said Sean Park, a senior partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group Inc. based in Hong Kong, who worked with Kim on a blockchain project.

Kim is a part of a burgeoning class of newly wealthy who made their money in virtual currencies. Bitcoin and Ether, the two largest tokens, continue to swing wildly, but both rose to records this year.

""The most successful investment is when you spot a fundamentally strong asset that's either not getting much attention or being viewed negatively,"" Kim said in an interview in Seoul, speaking about his early crypto bet.

The 36-year-old entrepreneur is a software developer by trade who has built and sold two companies. One was in education technology, while the other was a dating app.

In 2018, he co-founded Hashed, a kind of venture capital firm for blockchain projects. It takes stakes in companies and helps them to develop, including by arranging partnerships, providing financial advice and even helping with public relations.

Hashed raised $120 million in December for its first blockchain fund. Its backers included South Korean giants Naver Corp. and Kakao Corp., according to the companies' half-year business reports.

Now Hashed is planning to raise at least 200 billion won ($173 million) for a second fund this month, Kim said.

Hashed's investments typically range from $1 million to $10 million per company. It took part in a $7.5 million funding round in May for Vietnamese game-maker Sky Mavis, alongside billionaire Mark Cuban, following a seed round in 2019. It also invested $2.5 million in Loco, an India-based game streaming platform, Kim said.

But Hashed has attracted big players such as internet firm Naver, the third-largest company listed in South Korea by market value. Hashed has the most experience in the blockchain sector, according to Naver, which has so far disclosed investments of 14 billion won in Hashed's first fund.

""Our investors want to maximize their profit,"" Kim said. ""But they also want to learn about the market through us.""

Kim Kyonghwan, dean of the graduate school of entrepreneurship at Sungkyunkwan University in Suwon, a city near Seoul, sounds a note of caution.

""Given that the blockchain industry is new, unpredictability can be a short-term risk,"" he said. ""Still, I believe it's a market that will ultimately be institutionalized and grow.""

Kim said there's huge upside because the blockchain technology market is still in its infancy. But on crypto trading, he encourages people with no experience to be cautious about trying to make quick fortunes.

Sitting in a room named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Kim said he still has most of his Ether holdings. He said he's also a major investor in a token called Luna coin.

But when it comes to conventional investments like bonds and commodities, Kim prefers not to get involved. He even lives in a rented apartment with his wife rather than buying his own property, he said.

""Traditional assets are not in my interest,"" he said. ""They just seem too old and obsolete.""

Bitcoin, the world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency, scaled $50,940 (roughly Rs. 37.23 lakhs) on the day. On Monday (September 6) afternoon, the price of the cryptocurrency touched $51,809.55 (roughly Rs 37.87 lakh). This is the highest climb for the crypto token since May when it had started declining after reaching a record high of $65,000 (roughly Rs 47.51 lakh). Over the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has risen 8 percent.

Bitcoin's rise above $50,000 on Monday comes just a day ahead of El Salvador's plan to recognise the cryptocurrency as legal tender. In June, a proposal by the South American nation's President Nayib Bukele to embrace the cryptocurrency had received approval. The law will take effect tomorrow (September 7).

Before this, after consolidating for a few months since May on August 23, Bitcoin had touched $50,505 (roughly Rs. 36.91 lakhs). In the last couple of weeks, since August 23, Bitcoin had been trading between $46,500 and $50,000 (roughly Rs. 34 lakh to Rs. 37 lakh). Bitcoin price in India at 6pm on September 6 was around Rs. 39,60,000.

Ether, too, joins rally

On the back of Bitcoin's revival from its rout in May, Ether the crypto coin that had slumped along with a widespread cryptocurrency market crash in May also touched $4,000 (roughly Rs. 2.92 lakh) on Friday (September 3). This was the first time since May that Ether crossed the $4,000-mark. Ether's strong run began after its London upgrade last month. On Friday, the cryptocurrency traded at $4,025 (roughly Rs. 2.94 lakh). However, it slipped marginally on Monday, (September 6) trading at $3,944 (roughly Rs. 2.88 lakh). In the past 7 days, the digital asset has risen about 25 percent. Ethereum price in India at 6pm on September 6 was around Rs. 3,00,000.

What about other altcoins?

Alongside, Bitcoin and Ether, there are a few other altcoins, too, vying for their place in the limelight. Cardano, the number 3 coin in the world, has touched $2.91 (roughly Rs. 213). In the past 7 days, two other altcoins, Polkadot and Solana, have also risen by about 36 and 45 percent, respectively. At the time of writing, while Polkadot was trading at $35.01 (roughly Rs. 2,559), Solana was at $143.87 (roughly Rs. 10,516).

Will Bitcoin break the September jinx?

If you look at the history, September has not been favourable for Bitcoin's growth. In six of the past eight years, the cryptocurrency has had negative returns in this month. Will 2021 see a reversal in its fortune? Well, the month has just about begun, but one can only remain optimistic that the jinx will be broken this time round.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_disco_reuters_1622203490843.jpg',)",none
2021-09-07,NDTV Gadgets 360,Ethereum Rival Solana Jumps to 7th Spot in Cryptocurrency Top 10,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/solana-sol-cryptocurrency-price-value-investment-trading-ethereum-bitcoin-rival-top-10-crypto-token-virtual-currencies-2531684,"The cryptocurrency linked to the Solana network has jumped to seventh spot among the world's top 10 largest virtual coins amid optimism that the blockchain could be a long term competitor to Ethereum.

Solana's SOL token has tripled in about three weeks and now has a market value of more than $41 billion (roughly Rs. 2,99,640 crores), according to CoinGecko. Proponents tout the claimed speed and lower cost of transactions on Solana for decentralised finance and digital collectibles, applications where Ethereum dominates. Ether price in India stood at Rs. 2.97 lakhs as of 5:30pm IST on September 6.

“Solana has a growing ecosystem, projects are being built on it, and it's benefited hugely from the mania that's taking place in NFTs,” Antoni Trenchev, co-founder at crypto lender Nexo, wrote in an email. NFTs are non-fungible tokens used to trade digital collectibles. He said the backing of crypto figure Sam Bankman-Fried - chief executive of crypto exchange FTX - is helping.

Solana bills itself as the world's fastest blockchain and its website says the average cost per transaction is $0.00025 (roughly Rs. 0.018). In June it announced that it had raised $314 million (roughly Rs. 2,290 crores) in a funding round with investors including Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and CoinShares.

Late last month, Jump Trading-affiliated crypto market data provider Pyth Network went live on Solana's mainnet, a development that's expected to help bolster the world of decentralised finance. There are plans for it soon to be able to broadcast market data through the so-called Wormhole Network.

“It's becoming too big to ignore and offers a different smart contract solution to Ethereum,” Jonathan Cheesman, head of over-the-counter and institutional sales at FTX, wrote in an email.

So-called alternative coins like Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA, and Binance Coin have surged in recent weeks, taking some of the limelight from top tokens Bitcoin and Ether in a broad crypto revival from a May rout. Bitcoin has also rallied and came close to $52,000 (roughly Rs. 38 lakhs) on Monday. Cardano price in India stood at Rs. 216, Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 39.06 lakhs as of 5:30pm IST on September 6.

Skeptics argue the technological upgrades propelling some tokens may not justify the scale of the rallies.

The next session is at least two months away.But crypto exchanges have used the interim period to launch a massive lobbying initiative with several governments and regulatory agencies, raising concerns. The exchanges have argued that a ban on digital currency transactions will result in job losses.While there are fears that a ban will lead to investors getting locked into the instrument, sources indicated that a three-six month window will be provided for investors to exit.Several officials have junked the argument that crypto currencies are an asset class. Besides, there are worries over the legal basis for the presence of some of the exchanges, which remain outside the jurisdiction of either Sebi or the RBI. “There has to be global coordination to combat the challenge posed by cryptocurrencies. They are not a currency as only the sovereign can issue currency.

The primary goal of the bill is to define the cryptocurrency according to the technology used in it.



It is expected to shed light on the tax treatment of these digital assets and will also define how they are classified .



It is proposed that in India, crypto tokens should be recognized as digital assets as opposed to currency.



The policies on exchange ownership parameters, KYC , accounting and reporting standards and so on should be clarified.



, accounting and reporting standards and so on should be clarified. The cryptocurrency assets that were defined and classified by the government would only be allowed to trade in India. The crypto coins would then be taxed accordingly.



It has been suggested to apply a similar tax to the Security Transaction Tax (STT) in the coming times. It has also been said that these digital assets could also be entitled to income tax if they are indeed classified as commodities.



The income from the crypto trading could be taxed as business income in the hands of investors at normal rates of income tax.



With swift penetration and investment of over $6.6 billion in May 2021 in India’s crypto economy, it becomes all the more imperative now to have a well regulated mechanism. In light of this, the Economic Times reports that India’s upcoming cryptocurrency bill broadly aims to define and classify cryptocurrency assets in India. As per the report, currently the government is focussed on the end-use of the assets for regulatory purposes.In the report submitted by inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency, few of the provisions and suggestions laid down in the bill are:This would be the first time however that cryptocurrency would be defined and segmented on the basis of technology used. However, the working of the regulatory framework of cryptocurrency would become clearer and unambiguous to understand once the bill is approved and enacted. For instance, the manner in which assets will be taxed or regulated, or whether cryptocurrencies will be considered as commodities or currencies are yet not clear.Some big players in the crypto exchange have voiced optimism and hope for the new bill.

Police in Delta are warning residents thinking about investing in cryptocurrency to do their due diligence, after receiving six complaints about scams in recent weeks.

Most of the complaints were made in August, according to a news release from the Delta Police Department.

""Unfortunately their losses have been significant, ranging from just under $5,000 to over $100,000 in one file,"" police said in their release.

Police said there are ""a number of common factors"" in the six files that have been reported to them.

In most of the cases, the scammers contacted the victims through online platforms - such as dating sites and chat apps - and established a relationship with them.

""Investors were typically encouraged to e-transfer funds from their bank accounts to mobile wallets, and from there to unknown accounts,"" Delta police said. ""When victims tried to withdraw their 'profits' or investment, the money was either gone, or the victim was informed they needed to pay considerable additional fees to access their money.""

Police said would-be investors should research the name of the investment company or website they're considering to see if anyone else has been scammed. Investors should also avoid taking advice from people online who they've never met, police said.

For reputable information for investors, Delta police recommend visiting the websites of the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Canadian Securities Administrators.","('https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2014/3/6/bitcoin-business-1-1717992-1628027971356.jpg',)",none
2021-09-06,Bitcoin News,JPMorgan Says Cryptocurrency Markets Are 'Looking Frothy' – Markets and Prices Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-cryptocurrency-markets-looking-frothy/,"JPMorgan Says Cryptocurrency Markets Are 'Looking Frothy'

Global investment bank JPMorgan says cryptocurrency markets are “looking frothy” as retail investors spill over from the stock market into cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Crypto Markets Look Frothy, According to JPMorgan

JPMorgan published a note Wednesday on the stock market and cryptocurrencies. It explains that retail investors bought stocks at a record pace over the summer with an estimated net flow into the U.S. stock market of $13 billion in August after reaching a record high of almost $16 billion in July.

The JPMorgan analysts asserted that the stock-buying frenzy spilled over into altcoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in August, and the surge in NFTs and decentralized finance (defi) activity has boosted the price of certain cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, solana, and cardano.

They wrote:

Cryptocurrency markets [are] looking frothy again.

As Bitcoin.com News reported, the crypto market gained approximately 83% in value over the last three months, led by altcoins. The global crypto market cap is currently $2.28 trillion. Bitcoin’s dominance slipped from 47% on Aug. 1 to 41.39% Saturday. Ethereum (ETH) currently represents 20.13% of the entire crypto market, followed by cardano (ADA) at 4.11%. Solana (SOL) represents 1.80%.

Solana has become one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies this year. At the price of $141.04 per coin, SOL is now the seventh-largest crypto by market capitalization. The coin gained 310.8% during the last month and 3,277.6% year-to-date.

The JPMorgan analysts noted that altcoin trading now represents about 33% of the crypto market, emphasizing that it was a big increase from the 22% reading in early August. They concluded:

The share of altcoins looks rather elevated by historical standards and in our opinion it is more likely to be a reflection of froth and retail investor ‘mania’ rather than a reflection of a structural uptrend.

2021-09-06,Bitcoin News,India Has New Plan to Regulate Cryptocurrencies: Report – Regulation Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/india-new-plan-regulate-cryptocurrencies/,"India Has New Plan to Regulate Cryptocurrencies: Report

India is reportedly working on a new way to regulate cryptocurrencies. “The government is planning to define cryptocurrencies in the new draft bill that also proposes to compartmentalise virtual currencies on the basis of their use cases,” according to a report.

How India Will Regulate Cryptocurrencies

India is reportedly planning to regulate cryptocurrencies as commodities based on use cases. “The government is planning to define cryptocurrencies in the new draft bill that also proposes to compartmentalise virtual currencies on the basis of their use cases,” The Economic Times reported Friday, citing three people aware of the development. The publication detailed:

Cryptocurrencies will be treated as an asset/commodity for all purposes, including taxation and as per use case — payments, investment or utility.

“Crypto assets can be either categorized on the basis of the technology they use or they can be defined on their end-use. So, before talking about how the regulations should work, the government has to spell out what it means by cryptocurrencies,” said one of the persons with knowledge of the matter. The person added that the government “is not looking to allow payments and settlements through virtual currencies.”

In addition, the government will decide which cryptocurrencies will be allowed to trade in India.

This would be the first time cryptocurrencies will be categorized by the technology they use, sources told the news outlet, clarifying that the government will focus on the end-use of the asset for regulatory purposes.

The news of the Indian government possibly considering regulating cryptocurrencies as commodities and based on their use cases is well received by the local crypto community.

Nischal Shetty, CEO of crypto exchange Wazirx, said: “This step is very positive for the crypto industry and I’m glad that the government is taking this direction towards crypto regulation. This will bring more clarity for the entire industry and push more entrepreneurs into this sector. It will reduce the fear of VC investors wanting to invest in the crypto industry in India. For retail investors and traders, this will again boost confidence and bring in a sense of stability.”

Vikram Subburaj, CEO of crypto exchange Giottus, opined: “Just like the internet, cryptocurrencies have a multitude of use cases and hence a nuanced approach is best rather than a one-size-fits-all policy. Even among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, there is a wide difference in objective and investor appeal.”

Mudrex CEO Edul Patel commented: “The idea of compartmentalizing cryptos on their use cases is thoughtful, and if implemented efficiently, would be a significant boost to the newly recognized asset class. It also shows that the government acknowledges that cryptocurrencies are much more than speculative instruments and have actual use cases.”

Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon said recently that she has bought her first Ethereum coin. This was followed by yet another celebrity, the socialite-entrepreneur Paris Hilton, who shared her love for Bitcoin on Twitter. Ethereum and Bitcoin are the two top cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalisation.

Witherspoon, however, did not disclose the amount she invested in Ethereum. As of September 4 (3:50pm IST), Ether price in India stood at Rs. 2.99 lakhs.

Just bought my first ETH! Let's do this #cryptotwitter — Reese Witherspoon (@ReeseW) September 2, 2021

Announcing her “love” for Bitcoin, Hilton shared a tweet by Michael Saylor, the largest corporate backer of the cryptocurrency. Saylor's post read, “Diamonds may be your best friend, but Bitcoin is forever.” As of September 4 (3:50pm IST), Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 38.23 lakhs.

The tweets have arrived as cryptocurrency prices leave behind the market crash it suffered in May, when most digital coins lost a huge chunk of their value, and appeared poised to rally again. Some coins are already showing signs of their determination. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin was trading above $50,000 (roughly Rs. 37 lakhs) on September 4, a gain of nearly $12,000 (roughly Rs. 9 lakhs) from a month ago. Similarly, Ethereum has gained more than $1,400 (roughly Rs. 1 lakh) since August 5.

Many people welcomed the two celebrities into the crypto world. Among them was YouTuber Logan Paul, who offered Witherspoon an NFT from the World of Women collection.

welcome to the club Reese ???????? DM me your Eth address, I'd love to gift you this @WorldOfWomenNFT because y'all could be related. And it'd be badass for your first NFT project pic.twitter.com/epA0EZQdXG — Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) September 3, 2021

Hilton has for some time highlighted her support for Bitcoin. She had previously welcomed NFL legend Tom Brady “to the team” after he changed his profile picture to include laser eyes. The laser eyes mean that the person donning the look is 'laser-focussed' on seeing Bitcoin price reach the $100,000 (roughly Rs. 73 lakhs) mark.

Here are the best cryptocurrencies to buy and invest in.

At this point, there isn’t anyone who has not heard of cryptocurrencies. From this year’s biggest cryptocurrency crash due to China’s ban to Elon Musk’s controversial tweets and companies accepting Bitcoin as payments, as each day passes, we are seeing the hype around cryptocurrencies grow in real-time.

While Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto sector, other promising altcoins are also making headlines as they are becoming investor favorites. So obviously, Bitcoin is not the only crypto option to invest in. So if you are planning on buying cryptocurrencies this weekend, to start off your crypto journey, here are the 10 best stocks you should consider.

1. Bitcoin

In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin is equivalent to gold. From retail investors to prominent businessmen, everyone is putting their trust in Bitcoins. After the massive market crash in April 2021 that led to Bitcoin trading at US$30,000, the digital coin has bounced back to trade at US$50,000. The main reason behind the value is scarcity. Only 21 million Bitcoins exist and out of that, about 19 million have already been mined.

2. Ethereum

Second to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the silver of the cryptocurrency market. Thanks to Ethereum’s network that supports DeFi, a lot of cryptocurrencies have innovated the “smart contract” concept. This utility feature has made Etherum the second-highest valued cryptocurrency in the market according to its market cap US$441.13 billion.

3. Cardano

There’s something about Cardano that attracts several experienced investors. Cardano was created as a “third-generation cryptocurrency” that can solve common crypto problems like scalability and security. While other cryptos borrowed codes from existing projects, Cardano was built from code by code. Its network can handle smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and anything else that exists in the crypto world.

4. Polkadot

Polkadot is a recently-launched cryptocurrency that got famous quickly. Polkadot was created with an intention to use the “proof of stake” network verification system which is touted as a better system than the “proof of work” that Bitcoin and Etherum uses. Polkadot can process multiple transactions which makes it scalable. The versatility of this network allows it to be used for smart contracts, file storage chains, and IoT chains to allow device-to-device communication.

5. XRP

XRP, made by Ripple Labs, aims to create a fast and secure payment system that works globally. One of the most reliable cryptocurrencies, it has a huge loyal investor base. According to the company, many financial institutions prefer this cryptos RippleNet service which uses the XRP crypto coins. XRP’s payment system has the capability to compete with legacy systems like SWIFT and convert crypto to any fiat currency.

6. Uniswap

Uniswap is a platform that has its own reward token called the UNI that works on the Ethereum network. The USP of these tokens is the fact that they can be exchanged among crypto users without trading them on centralized crypto exchanges like Binance. The USP is a hit as traders have been using the tokens, making it the best DeFi token by market cap.

7. Chainlink

Chainlink has a loft ambition for itself in the cryptocurrency market. Its purpose is to make a decentralized oracle network that can serve as a middleman between smart contracts and data sources. Basically, it makes smart contracts trustworthy by providing a secure, reliable link. It’s also a core part of the DeFi system. Due to its utility, The World Economic Forum named Chainlink one of the 100 most promising tech pioneers of 2020.

8. Stellar

The idea of cryptocurrencies is to simplify payments and Stellar’s mission aligns with that, to simplify cross-currency transfers. For that, this crypto network has partnered with International Business Machine Inc to create IBM World Wire. This collaboration enables fast currency transfer services to financial institutions across the world.

9. Dogecoin

Elon Musk’s tweets revived this meme coin that was supposed to be forgotten by the world. Dogecoin didn’t have any purpose until billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of Dallas Mavericks, decided that the NBA team would accept Dogecoin as payment. Such celebrity incidents now made Dogecoin one of the most anticipated cryptos.

10. Aave

Aave’s purpose is to complete the lack of borrowing and lending applications on Ether’s network. For this utility, Aave has now become a DeFi pioneer.

2021-09-06,Bitcoin News,Japan's Financial Giant SBI to Launch Cryptocurrency Fund – Finance Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/japans-financial-giant-sbi-cryptocurrency-fund/,"Japan's Financial Giant SBI to Launch Cryptocurrency Fund

Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings is reportedly launching a crypto fund that will invest in several cryptocurrencies. “I want people to hold it together with other assets and experience firsthand how useful it can be for diversifying portfolios,” said an executive of the company.

SBI Holdings Launching Crypto Fund

SBI Holdings Inc. has revealed its plan to launch a cryptocurrency fund by the end of November, Bloomberg reported Thursday, calling it the country’s first crypto fund.

Tomoya Asakura, director of SBI Asset Management and president of SBI affiliate Morningstar Japan, explained that the fund will invest in a number of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, and litecoin.

He added that the fund is aimed at customers who understand the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including their high volatility. In addition, there may be a minimum investment of about one million yen ($9,122) to three million yen.

Asakura noted in a recent interview that if the first fund “goes very well,” then the firm would like to “move quickly” to launch a second fund. He opined:

I want people to hold it together with other assets and experience firsthand how useful it can be for diversifying portfolios.

SBI is also considering launching another fund specifically tailored to institutional investors if there is enough demand for the product, the executive noted.

Due to strict crypto regulations following hacking incidents at exchanges in Japan, it has taken SBI four years to get its crypto fund off the ground, the publication conveyed. It added that the company had to change its plan of how the fund is offered to investors to comply with regulations.

SBI initially planned to launch its crypto fund as an investment trust, a popular investing method in Japan. However, the country’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), banned companies from selling crypto investments using this method. The company then changed its plan and will offer its crypto fund to investors using a vehicle known as an “anonymous partnership.”

Asakura noted that “There is an overwhelming perception that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and speculative.” He plans to build a track record to show the public and regulators that cryptocurrencies can help investors diversify their portfolios.

2021-09-06,US News Money,How Blockchain Can Transform the Financial Services Industry,https://money.usnews.com/investing/cryptocurrency/articles/how-blockchain-can-transform-the-financial-services-industry,"Blockchain has the potential to make the financial services industry more transparent, less susceptible to fraud and cheaper for consumers. (Getty Images)

Blockchain technology is one of the leading innovations in the finance industry, holding promise to reduce fraud, ensure quick and secure transactions and trades, and ultimately help manage risk within the interconnected global financial system.

Blockchain accomplishes this through advanced cryptography that is designed to be resistant to hacking, adding trust to the transaction ecosystem.

There are many financial uses provided by blockchain, not limited to keeping track of transactions and trades. As our global financial system becomes more connected in our age of digital transformation, investors would be well advised to learn about how blockchain is changing the system and how to gain and regulate exposure to this development.

Here's what investors should know about blockchain's growing role in financial services and the earning potential and risk factors it poses, from tech-oriented startups to traditional banks:

What is blockchain?

Benefits of blockchain in financial services

Risks that blockchain and financial institutions face

Blockchain investments to buy

What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a digital collection of transactions that are tracked and recorded in a decentralized network. It is a distributed ledger, which means there is no central authority of the network, or no one person or entity in control with the ability to corrupt the network. The blockchain comprises individual blocks of data, each containing a record of information, that are linked together in chronological order. These links cannot be changed, which is what instills confidence in the network.

This revolutionary technology manages transactions of information by securing them as they occur. The purpose of blockchain is to lower the cost of transactions and make them more efficient and faster.

The technology has many applications that can be integrated into different industries, providing investors with many opportunities. For starters, it's one of the technological underpinnings of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

One industry with clear applications for the blockchain is financial services, where companies are in a perpetual race to reduce the costs and friction of transactions.

Benefits of Blockchain in Financial Services

Blockchain has the potential to make the financial services industry more transparent, less susceptible to fraud and cheaper for consumers.

Improving transparency. Blockchain can make the financial industry more transparent since users are performing activities on a public ledger. This transparency can expose inefficiencies like fraud, leading to problem-solving that could reduce risk for financial institutions.

Adding security. As consumers become increasingly active online, the digital universe is a breeding ground for scammers. With blockchain technology, this concern could be reduced. Payments and money transfers made on the blockchain are faster and more traceable than in traditional banking.

When information flows through different financial intermediaries, there is a risk of interception of that information, raising the possibility of fraud. This hole in oversight can be filled with blockchain's cryptographic algorithms that bring security in the exchange of information between parties.

""In traditional finance, clean audit trails can be difficult to procure at times, which have led to severe economic losses in the past due to negligent behavior or malicious actors,"" says Ben Samaroo, co-founder and CEO at WonderFi, a decentralized finance platform. ""This risk can be significantly reduced with a combination of blockchain technology and machine learning to monitor and manage risks with a high degree of precision.""

Financial technology companies other businesses that use large amounts of data need blockchain to build data integrity.

""Since the blockchain network is distributed, it doesn't have a single source of failure,"" says Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer at Gate Technology, a cryptocurrency exchange based in China.

This characteristic, Tatibouet says, increases the network's resilience, protecting it from compromise.

Lowering costs. As investors move away from financial advisors to avoid higher fees, blockchain provides an opportunity for consumers to benefit from lower costs associated with traditional financial services.

Financial technology companies have become a huge part of the financial services industry, allowing investors to open accounts with digital advisors and make independent financial decisions. As fintech plays a stronger role in global finance, its relationship with blockchain will inevitably become stronger.

This innovation can be good for consumers because investors are getting more for their money and they're getting a balance between automation of financial services and a lower cost.

""The institutions that adopt this new technology first will be able to streamline internal processes and provide their customers with lower-cost financial services, effectively beating their competitors on cost to capture a larger portion of the market,"" Samaroo says.

This ultimately benefits the everyday investor who's looking to cut expenses while accessing this new financial services environment.

Risks that Blockchain and Financial Institutions Face

Weighing against the promise blockchain holds for financial institutions is one major risk affecting the bottom line: Traditional financial institutions make money on transaction fees that could be lowered or eliminated with blockchain technology.

When it comes to transferring money, consumers have to rely on banks or third parties to process transactions.

But adoption of blockchain could bypass third parties such as banks, which would eliminate fees and other costs associated with these services. As a result, banks may face challenges in volume and transaction-based revenue.

Blockchain makes the infrastructure that's proprietary to financial institutions less important because it serves as a verification mechanism that's ""not concentrated in the power of one institution,"" says Thomas Shohfi, assistant professor in the Lally School of Management at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.

In addition, blockchain innovation is moving so fast that regulation hasn't caught up yet. So the potential policies impacting blockchain can be seen as another obstacle in incorporating blockchain in financial services.

""Existing regulation does present a significant obstacle for blockchain adoption since regulators will prioritize existing incumbents over disruptors,"" Tatibouet says.

Regulators are working through determining the pros and cons of blockchain technology to see if it's suitable for financial institutions and what the consequences are for companies and consumers.

""This rigidity has stifled innovation so far,"" Tatibouet says. ""However, this view is changing as governments and other public organizations are seeing the benefits of this technology.""

Blockchain Investments to Buy

For investors who want exposure to blockchain as it changes the financial services industry, there are a few ways to approach this investment. One way is to buy into companies whose businesses are tapped into blockchain technology.

""Financial companies or technology companies that see blockchain as a disruptive technology and want to be experts in it can sell their services to customers,"" Shohfi says.

A company that falls in this category is International Business Machines Corp. (ticker: IBM), which is focused on the development of blockchain technologies. IBM also provides services for businesses to integrate blockchain for efficiency, scalability and growth.

Another approach investors can take is investing in cryptocurrency-oriented stocks that serve as a pure play for blockchain investments. MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) fits the bill here. The software solutions company holds more than 105,000 bitcoins, a portfolio valued at more than $5 billion.

Square Inc. (SQ) is another company that's heavily invested in Bitcoin and strongly believes in the blockchain network. The payment services company recently announced that it will launch a decentralized finance platform with a focus on Bitcoin applications.

Investors are taking notice of these stocks and their potential. MicroStrategy is up about 80% year to date, and Square has seen a year-to-date rise of 23%. That's compared with the S&P 500's year-to-date return of about 20%. Investing in these publicly traded companies allows you to broadly invest in the blockchain without having direct exposure to the volatility and speculation associated with some cryptocurrencies.","('https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/89cc057/2147483647/crop/2096x1398%2B0%2B0/resize/970x647/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fa0%2F4c%2F5d53326d407b99b8a971d0a33326%2F210903-stock.jpg',)",none
2021-09-06,India Today,"Cryptocurrencies likely to be treated as commodities, may face taxation: Report",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/cryptocurrency-draft-bill-details-taxation-classification-of-virtual-coin-1848885-2021-09-03,"The much-awaited cryptocurrency draft bill may propose to define cryptocurrencies and classify them based on usage. The move is likely to benefit Indian cryptocurrency investors who have been waiting for a concrete law to regulate virtual coin trading.

Cryptocurrencies could be defined as commodities or assets in the new draft bill, reported The Economic Times after speaking to people aware of the development. The draft bill may also propose taxation for cryptocurrencies including laws for payments, investments and other utilities, added the report.

While the government had earlier said it would not go for an outright ban on cryptocurrencies, it has not yet provided any clarity on how it plans to deal with virtual coin trade in India.

Check today's cryptocurrency prices

However, cryptocurrencies may be categorised as per the technology they use in the new draft bill. But the primary focus of the government will be based on end-usage of the assets for regulatory purposes, according to the ET report.

TAX TREATMENT, OTHER RULES

The new draft bill is also expected to determine how taxes will be levied on cryptocurrency investments.

A person quoted in the ET report said the government’s draft crypto bill aims to define cryptocurrency and its treatment in various use cases. This will help authorities register cryptocurrency trade in the books of accounts and tax accordingly. However, the government may not be looking to allow payments and settlements through virtual currencies through its bill.

More clarity is needed on whether cryptocurrencies will be treated as commodities, services or similar to equities; only then can virtual coins be taxed or regulated. This is why the government’s primary goal is to define cryptocurrencies in its draft bill. Simply put, a clear definition of cryptocurrency is required to figure out how it will be regulated and taxed in future.

However, sources quoted in the ET report indicated that the government could apply something similar to security transaction tax (STT) on cryptocurrency trade. If they are categorised as commodities, the returns or gains made by investors could also be taxed as business income at normal income tax rates.

WHY CRYPTOCURRENCY BILL IS IMPORTANT

The development comes at a time when cryptocurrency trade is growing rapidly in the country. Domestic cryptocurrency exchanges have reported a sharp jump in trading volumes, and they have also requested the government to regulate virtual coin trade rather than imposing a ban.

Cryptocurrency exchanges in India have said numerous times that the country needs to recognise cryptocurrency tokens as digital assets rather than currencies, and subsequently, clarify policies related to crypto trade.

As of now, cryptocurrency does not have any legal status in India and are unregulated. The proposed crypto bill is likely to define the future of virtual coin trade in the country.

People in the know said only the cryptocurrencies that are covered under the government’s definition will be allowed to be traded in India.

2021-09-06,NDTV Gadgets 360,Cryptocurrency Investment 101: How to Calculate Moving Average and Why is it Important,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/moving-average-calculate-cryptocurrency-investment-trading-tools-tips-dogecoin-how-to-2528622,"Moving average in the field of finance — including cryptocurrencies — is a stock indicator commonly used by investors for technical analysis. Among the most important reasons for the calculation of a moving average is to mitigate the impact of sometimes random or short-term fluctuations in the prices of any stock — and cryptocurrencies are especially prone to extremes. The other reason, of course, is to constantly update the average price of a stock for a selected period of time. It is also referred to as a lagging indicator as it is based on the past prices of a given stock.

And just like it is used for any other stock, moving average also helps an investor analyse the trend of a cryptocurrency not just in the present but also the future by making use of the past prices. In simple words, it gives investors have a better picture of what they are going to make on their investments should they invest in a particular digital currency.

How to calculate a moving average for cryptocurrencies?

The method is fairly simple. It's the application that's more important. For example, if you want to calculate the five-day moving average for Dogecoin, this is how you do it:

The closing prices of Dogecoin in the last five days, let's say, were 10, 13, 14, 11, and 12, respectively. Now, add the prices for the last five days and divide the total by 5.

10+13+14+11+12 = 60/5. The answer is 12, which is the moving average of Dogecoin relative to the last five days.

Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs. 22.7 as of 3:30pm IST on September 3.

Importance of moving average in cryptocurrency investments

Experts say that when the prices of a stock are below a moving average, it's an indication to traders of a bearish trend, which means both price and sentiments are trending down. On the contrary, if the prices are above the moving average, it's a sign of a bullish trend. However, other indicators, including the relative strength index, should also back the moving averages.

Among other important functions, a moving average can also help gauge the momentum, which basically measures the rise or fall in the prices of a cryptocurrency. With the help of a moving average, one can attempt to forecast, if not accurately pick and predict, the trajectory of a cryptocurrency in the days to come. This helps an investor better decide if they are making a safe and sound investment.

As we explained before, the greater the number of days the bigger is the lag. The traders actually use these figures based on the number of days to decide on whether or not they should invest in a digital asset or a cryptocurrency token.

The other advantage, of course, for traders in terms of calculating a moving average is that they can customise the time period to check the average prices according to their own needs. Moving average for a smaller period is naturally more price-sensitive compared to an average calculated for a longer period of time.

Remember, the moving average is only an indication of the trend and not a tool that sets the trend. You only get a picture of how a cryptocurrency token has performed relative to the number of days you pick to find the moving average. Cryptocurrency is deemed to be a relatively riskier asset class and the golden rule, as experts say, is to not invest more than you can afford to lose.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_goldbg_pixabay_1629281868518.png',)",none
2021-09-06,The Financial Express,Cryptocurrency: What is coin burning and why it should be a part of every investor’s calculus?,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/cryptocurrency-what-is-coin-burning-and-why-it-should-be-a-part-of-every-investors-calculus/2323339/,"Representative image

If you are new to cryptocurrencies, you must have been amused hearing about coin burn; wondering why someone needs to burn the coins? Well, let us explain.

Coin burn is a process where the miners and developers remove the coins from circulation. In other words, coin burn is a process of destroying the coin so that it is not available for further use (trading or otherwise). The developers and miners will send the coins to the specialised addresses whose private keys are not accessible. Further, they should provide the proof-of-burn algorithm to the market to facilitate cross verification.

Krishna Prasad, Associate Professor of Finance, T A Pai Management Institute, explained this with an example: Imagine a person having 10 notes of Rs. 2,000 and he/she decides to burn (literally) 5 notes. Once 5 notes are burnt, these notes cannot be used/accessed by anyone including the issuer. As cryptocurrencies are virtual and cannot be literally burnt, the miners/developers use digital means to make the coin unusable.

Coin burn is basically done to create a supply crunch, thereby creating an artificial upward pull for the token price.

Abhay Chebbi, Pro-Chancellor, Alliance University, said that in the real world, coin burn would amount to making a pile of currency coins or notes, and lighting a pyre to the pile. Coin burn in the cryptocurrency world is exactly the same albeit it is the burning of the cryptocurrency virtually. Each cryptocurrency network defines a protocol for accomplishing the burn but it amounts to associating the coins in circulation with unobtainable private keys so nobody can claim them to be theirs. Additionally, the event of a Coin burn itself is recorded in the ledger books so the burn is foolproof.

New Fad?

According to Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex, coin burning is not a new concept. However, this has gained a lot of attention lately following the recent London Hard Fork upgrade to the Ethereum network. With this upgrade, around 3.17 ETH is being burned every minute. To put this into perspective, the average price of ETH over the past seven days was $3200. It means that more than half a million dollars worth of ETH is being burned every hour! Such news manages to grab eyeballs faster.

Why crypto creators burn their coin

Prof. Chebbi said crypto creators burn the coins in an attempt to increase the value of the coins that remain in circulation. It is not very dissimilar to what happens in the realm of Oil. “If the price of a barrel of crude oil drops because there is a glut in the supply and the demand is not commensurately high, then the oil-producing nations reduce the supply so the prices go back up again. The same dynamic of supply and demand is at play behind the process of coin burning,” he told FE Online.

Explaining further, Prof. Prasad said the regular currency (INR, USD, GBP etc.) is issued and controlled by the respective governments through the central banks. If the country issues excess currency it will lead to inflation (hyperinflation) as the supply of money is greater than the demand. On the other hand, if the country issues less currency it might lead to depression or contraction of the economy. Similarly, the excess supply of coins might result in inflation. As these coins are not issued or controlled by any single authority, the developers/miners burn the coins.

Almost all cryptocurrency networks have defined the protocols and mechanisms for coin burn. “Proof-of-burn” has become as integral a part of crypto talk as “proof-of-work” (which gives rise to coins being mined).

It is not necessary that all cryptocurrencies need to be burned. Only those with excess supply undergo this process.

Main Objective

“The primary objective of coin burn is to regulate the supply and thereby stabilize the price. The process is similar to demonetisation of currency or buy-back of shares. On June 25th Infosys Ltd. announced the buy-back 1.084 million shares. The objective here was to reduce the supply of Infosys shares traded in the stock markets. The earnings per share (EPS) of Infosys after the buy-back will increase which will in turn increase the share price. Similarly, when the inflation in country rises due to excess money supply, the central bank increases the interest rates. The person with excess cash will then deposit the money in bank, thereby, reducing the liquidity. This example is not exactly same as the burn process, however, achieves the same objective,” said Prof. Prasad.

When the developers/miners burn the coins, the number of coins available in the digital currency market reduces. As a result, the price of the coin will increase (at least theoretically it should).

Prof. Chebbi said a fundamental difference between the fiat currency and cryptocurrency is, fiat currency is inflationary in nature while cryptocurrency is deflationary. The reason for this is, the total amount of fiat money in circulation keeps increasing with time (through the instrument of debt, and printing of money by the Central banks). But, the total amount of cryptocurrency (for most currencies) in circulation has an upper limit — for example, in the case of Bitcoin, the target is 21 million coins. Therefore, the value of a unit of fiat money loses value over time (because of inflation), and in the case of crypto money when mining can no longer unearth new coins, a unit of crypto money will keep accumulating value (deflation). Even so, till such a saturation point is reached, the crypto promoters reckon the Coin burn is a good way to boost the value of cryptocurrencies.

Coin burn impact on market

Prof. Prasad said the outcome of coin burn is not yet been proved (as it is a recent phenomenon). However, theoretically the burn process should stabilise the prices/markets.

Prof. Chebbi also said that the jury is still out there on the impact of the burn process on the cryptocurrency market. In the immediate aftermath of Bitcoin’s last Coin burn, it did gain value. On the other hand, burning of BNB tokens didn’t fetch any appreciable dividends for that currency. “We think that the long-term stability and viability of a cryptocurrency market is driven more by the strength of that currency itself (such as the confidence of the investors in it and eventually its acceptance by the world as a medium of exchange). However, Coin burn does have a place in propping up the currency and for demonstrating the promoters’ commitment to the currency,” he said.

“The same way that different fiat currencies — the U.S. Dollar, Indian Rupee, the U.K. pound etc have their innate strengths, different cryptocurrencies be it Bitcoin, BNB tokens, or Ethereum have their own strengths. The impact of the Central banks’ policies (quantitative easing or tightening of money supply et al) on the stability of different currencies is not uniform. Extrapolating that to cryptocurrencies, we find that different currencies respond to Coin burn in their own distinct ways,” Prof Chebbi added.

Coin burn impact on investors

According to Prof Prasad, the coin burn process is very important for two reasons.

– First, the investors get the tangible benefit through improved valuation.

Second, the coin burn process signals the investors that the prices will be stabilized through self-regulation in the absence of regulators.

For example, when an individual stock hits the upper or lower circuit, the stock exchange (NSE or BSE) suspends the trade to allow the prices to stabilize. But this is not possible in the case of digital currency. Hence, the coin burn instils the confidence among the investors as it serves as a mechanism to stabilise the digital currency prices.

Study coin burn before investing

Prof. Chebbi said, “Unless you are hoarding Coins of any denomination (be it Bitcoin, BNE or others), you don’t want to burn the coins you own. Currently, only the promoters (for example Binance’s BNB tokens) burn some of their holdings so the people investing in their currency realize a higher value for their investments. If you are an investor looking to invest in crypto, you should study if Coin burns have happened for that currency and if there is a defined burn schedule.”

“It should be a part of your calculus while making investment decisions. In general, if Coin burns have happened and/or scheduled, it should give you more confidence that there are people invested in seeing that currency grow, and that would be a factor in its favor,” he added.","('https://images.financialexpress.com/2021/09/coin-burn.jpg',)",none
2021-09-06,News18,Crypto as Commodity: Government to Issue New Cryptocurrency Bill. Know the Details,https://www.news18.com/news/business/crypto-as-commodity-government-to-issue-new-cryptocurrency-bill-know-the-details-4161032.html,"Cryptocurrencies are potentially looking at a new change in India as the government is planning on ‘defining’ it as per a report by Economic Times. It was suggested that the government of India was proposing a new bill to segment cryptocurrencies on use cases sources informed ET. This would be a first for cryptocurrencies as they have never been categorized by the technology used. However, the government’s focus, for the time being, is on the end-use of the asset for regulatory purposes the report mentioned.

This new bill is expected to outline the tax treatment of these digital assets and will define how they are classified in the book. It remained ambiguous as to whether the cryptocurrencies were considered currencies, commodities services or more equitable said the report. It eventually comes down to a matter of law, as the main concern with the ambiguity is in regards to how the asset is taxed or regulated. Till now, that has not been the case with cryptocurrency in India.

The first goal of the government in this matter is then to define the cryptocurrency sources told ET. It was also suggested that India should recognize crypto tokens as digital assets as opposed to a currency, while simultaneously clarifying the policies on exchange ownership parameters, KYC, accounting and reporting standards and so on, said the report.

It was also reported that only the cryptocurrency assets that were classified and defined by the government would be allowed to trade in India. The crypto coins would then be taxed accordingly. It was suggested that the government might apply a tax similar to the Security Transaction Tax (STT) going forward. In another line, these digital assets could also be subject to income tax if they are indeed classified as commodities. The income could be taxed as business income in the hands of the investors at the normal rates of income tax.

In the past the Reserve Bank of India had flagged the issue of cryptocurrency as it was not regulated nor did it have any prior framework in place. Having said that, this move by the government could be seen as a morale boost for Indian cryptocurrency investors. It could also see a rise in the spread of knowledge of the previously mysterious digital asset and could promote better investment opportunities.

While this does capture the attention of the industry experts, investors and crypto exchanges alike, one would have to wait and see what the new bill spells for crypto going forward in the country.

The global crypto market had seen some major fluctuations over the past few months. At present, the global market cap stood at $2.26 trillion, which was a 1.15 per cent increase over the day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours was $131.49 billion, which pointed to a 2.52 per cent increase.

Bitcoin which is the leading crypto coin had a price of $49,927.54 on Friday. It maintained a market dominance of 41.51 per cent, although it did see a drop of 0.63 per cent over the course of the day. Other popular coins in the market include Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin and Tether.

Cryptocurrency prices weakened marginally over the past 24 hours, but the momentum remains strong at the moment and investors are expected to end the week with decent trading gains.

Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, was trading marginally higher than its value 24 hours ago, but its valuation has dipped below $50,000. It was trading at $49,601.28 at 11:45 am and its market capitalisation stood at $932.73 billion. The trading volume in the last 24 hours was 1.16 billion.

Ether was still going strong as it was trading over 1.30 per cent higher than its price a day ago. It was trading at over $3,800 and its market capitalisation is close to crossing $450 billion. The 24-hour trading volume remains similar to Bitcoin.

Not just benchmarks but a number of altcoins including Cardano are set to enter the weekend on a high note. While Cardano fell over 3 per cent today, it still remains close to $3.

Commenting on the cryptocurrency market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “Bitcoin shot past the $50,000 mark, and this got the crypto investors pumped up. We witnessed volume traded across exchanges shooting up.”

“Although Bitcoin faced a minor consolidation after the $50k mark and consolidated, the altcoins had an even better session. Ether shot past the $3800 mark, and the third-largest crypto, Cardano, went past the $3 price point,” he added.

Crypto assets have gained tremendous traction in recent years especially among young investors. Its exponential growth in popularity has also raised concerns over the inherent risks of unregulated transactions between cryptocurrency holders. To prevent cryptocurrencies from becoming the conduits for money laundering, authorities have tightened regulations for the industry, including the new Taiwan's cryptocurrency rules enacted on July 1 which require cryptocurrency exchanges to verify and evaluate user identities.

""ACE Exchange has cooperated with KPMG to put in place relevant measures to fight against money laundering and terrorism financing practices by strictly scrutinizing user information and identities even before the rollout of the new Taiwanese AML regulations for cryptocurrencies. We have also joint hands with Taiwan's criminal and investigative authorities to help establish well-rounded anti-money laundering mechanisms within the crypto space,"" said David Pan, Founder of ACE Exchange.

Security is ACE Exchange's top priority

ACE Exchange provides dual protection for the New Taiwan dollar and crypto assets. In 2020, the company collaborated with KGI Bank to set up ""FIA Fund Trust Custody"". Powered by the world-renowned blockchain security firm CYBAVO, ACE Exchange is equipped with a state-of-the-art digital asset security system and third-party digital wallet for users.

Meanwhile ACE Exchange's partnership with the S&P AA-rated international insurance company Lockton allows users to enjoy all-around protection.

Since its inception, ACE Exchange has set priority on security and user protection, which laid a robust groundwork for regulatory compliance regarding AML and KYL in partnership with world-leading law firms, accounting firms and financial institutions.

In early 2018, ACE Exchange received guidance from KPMG to set up transaction procedures and ensure regulatory compliance to address AML and countering the financing of terrorism (CTF) risks.

In 2021, Rex Chu, Risk Consultant and Executive Vice President of Forensic Accounting Services of KPMG Taiwan, assisted ACE Exchange in planning the product development and operating procedures in accordance with relevant Taiwan's laws and regulations, to meet the standards of high-profile financial banks. It has placed ACE Exchange at the forefront of the crypto industry in building and strengthening its risk management protocols and user protection mechanisms.

About ACE Exchange

Established in 2018 by David Pan, former COO of KPMG Innovation and Startups, ACE Exchange is one of the biggest cryptocurrency platforms with best-in-class digital security measures in Taiwan.

2021-09-06,Gadgets 360,Former US President Donald Trump Says Cryptocurrency is a ‘Disaster Waiting to Happen’,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-disaster-fake-donald-trump-former-us-president-dogecoin-price-naomi-osaka-2527274,"Former US President Donald Trump is “not a big fan” of cryptocurrency. Trump has been vocal about his dislike for digital currency several times. On Tuesday, he told Fox Business that investing in crypto could be “potentially a disaster waiting to happen”. In an exclusive interview on the show Varney & Co., Trump was asked by host Stuart Varney, “Do you have a dabble in Bitcoin or cryptos?” Trump noted that he does not invest in Bitcoin or other digital currencies. “I like the currency of the United States,” he said.

Trump did not budge from his point and added, “I feel that it (cryptocurrency) hurts the United States currency.” Instead of supporting the digital currency, Trump kept his faith in the US dollar. He said, “I think we should be invested in our currency.”

His attack continued when he said that cryptocurrencies “may be fake”. He added, “Who knows what they are? But they certainly are something that people don't know very much about.”

Even earlier, Trump had expressed his dislike for towards cryptocurrency. Once, he had called it a “scam” and alleged that it was taking “the edge off of the dollar and the importance of the dollar”.

Trump's statements come at a time when cryptocurrency still remains unregulated under US legislation. However, Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler looks like he's in favour of cryptocurrencies. He believes that the “field is not going to reach any of its potential if it tries to stay outside of our laws”.

Gensler also called cryptocurrency “innovative technologies” while also being aware of the risks in the industry.

Over the years, cryptocurrencies have had mixed responses from people. While they have received a lot of support from the likes of Elon Musk, there have been others like Trump who have slammed the digital assets. A few days ago, billionaire John Paulson had called cryptocurrencies a “worthless” bubble. He said that no matter where cryptocurrencies are trading now, eventually they will go to zero, once the exuberance wears off.

However, on the other hand, looks like defending US Open champion Naomi Osaka, has taken a keen interest in Dogecoin, which was spurred by all the noise around the meme-based cryptocurrency. In an interview a few days ago, Osaka said that she's even had discussions with her agent about cryptocurrencies and that she had read about Dogecoin as well. Dogecoin price in India was around Rs. 23 at 7pm on September 2.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/trump_reuters_1610080649024.jpg',)",none

NEW DELHI: Will cryptocurrencies wreck the global warming targets and trigger an environmental disaster? This question has become the topic of heated debates between cryptocurrency advocates and those who want them banned.The first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 consume ginormous amounts of electricity when they are mined. Mining is the process by which new Bitcoins enter circulation and the ledger of transactions is maintained and validated.It requires sophisticated and powerful computers to solve cryptographic puzzles and has been built around the “proof of work” principle.Mining has been getting progressively more difficult and expensive over time because of the way the first crypto currency, Bitcoin, and the others that followed initially, were created.But how much energy does cryptocurrency mining actually consume? Estimates vary. The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF) had estimated that currently Bitcoin mining consumes around 110 Terawatt Hours per year.Others have put it even higher – at around 155 TWh or so. To put that in perspective, it is around 0.55 percent of global electricity production, or equal to what a country like Malaysia consumes annually.And that is just for Bitcoin mining. Add the others and you are looking at an even higher energy footprint.Critics point out that the CO2 and heat generated by crypto currency mining is far more than any gains that one gets from emission reductions of electric vehicles (EV) being used around the world.Bitcoin mining and that of other similar cryptocurrencies were particularly bad for the environment until even a couple of years ago because the miners primarily used power from plants using coal.Many of the crypto currency mining hubs were in China, and while some of them used the cleaner hydro power, a number of miners depended on thermal power plants too. At one point, over 60 percent of Bitcoin mining was taking place in China.But over the past year, China has cracked down on miners and most miners have started moving out. Also, increasingly miners have been relying on green and renewable energy rather than thermal power.Most miners are working in areas where energy is generated using solar, wind, hydro and even flared natural gas of oil wells. While these do not cut out emissions altogether, there has been a concerted effort by the crypto currency champions to utilise energy that is both cheap and has a lower carbon footprint.Meanwhile, newer crypto currencies are ensuring that they either use less power for mining or use a different method of validation called “proof of stake”, which does not require using the kind of power that proof of work crypto currencies require.Even Ethereum, the second oldest and second most popular crypto currency is coming out with version 2.0, which will drastically cut down its carbon footprint.The worry for cryptocurrency miners is that increasingly, countries will regulate mining or ban it altogether in order to meet the emission goals agreed upon. This is why the search of solutions is going on frenetically.Multiple suggestions ranging from introducing a new cryptocurrency that will be given to anyone who can submit proof of removing each ton of CO2 or other greenhouse gases to the development of new eco-friendly crypto currencies to a blockchain-based platform to track carbon emissions and reduction of crypto currency usage.One solution – the Crypto Climate Accord -- envisages a pact that will see the shifting of all crypto currency activities to clean fuels and become net zero carbon emission by 2040. The problem is that while it has supporters, many of the older and more popular cryptocurrencies have yet to sign up for it.The issue is that using green energy for cryptocurrency mining alone doesn’t solve the entire problem. Even when clean energy or renewable energy like solar is used, the sheer power needed by the computers generates enormous heat.Crypto mining also adds to the pile of electronic waste that needs to be disposed of. And the fact that cryptocurrency mining becomes more difficult and requires more computing power every year creates its own set of environmental hazards.Crypto advocates suggest that eventually a solution acceptable to all will be found. Apart from transiting to green energy, crypto miners will also play a role in grid balancing and flexible demand-response services.Over the next few years, we will know whether that works out as well as they expect. Meanwhile, environmental scientists plan to keep a close watch on the crypto mining industry.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85864245,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50952,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

In the past, China’s regulatory crackdown pushed the Bitcoin to touch an all -time low and also made the cryptocurrency market volatile, so much so that Bitcoin oscillated between highs and lows. Bitcoin touched a low of $28,000 in June and high of $75,000 in April. Also, the largest currency Bitcoin’s dominance witnessed an increase of 0.08 per cent and currently stands at 42.16 per cent. On the other hand, Ethereum, the viral currency of Bitcoin, was also trading in the green at $3,742.55, up 6.48 per cent. Amongst the basket of cryptocurrency, barring Tether, USD Coin, Binance USD were trading in the red on Thursday.

“BTC remained muted over the past few days, yet most of the Altcoins made significant bullish movements. However, it was a totally different story over the past 24 hours. We witnessed massive volatility where BTC moved significantly higher. It made the already pumped-up Altcoins move even higher. The largest Altcoin, Ether, made a huge jump from the day’s low of $3384 and moved closer to the $3800 mark. Most of the other top Altcoins replicated a similar move. The crypto fear and greed index is at 71 for the past couple of weeks, indicating a massive bullish momentum prevailing in the markets. The entire crypto market capitalization moved a massive 4 per cent higher over the previous day and stood close to $2.18 trillion. Traded volumes were significantly high, indicating the buying pressure across the spectrum,” Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder, Mudrex- A Global Crypto Trading Platform, said.

In the last two weeks, favourable developments in the world of cryptocurrency led to a sharp rally in the prices of cryptocurrency. After Raghuram Rajan, former RBI governor of India’s comment regarding cryptocurrency, on Wednesday, well known tennis player Naomi Osaka showed her interest in cryptocurrency. Yesterday, she took to Twitter and said, “I was actually just talking with my agent about cryptocurrencies,” Osaka said in an interview to Bloomberg. “I know that online, everything is getting bigger. I remember reading about Dogecoin … there’s going to be something new and interesting that’s going to pop up.” On Thursday, the global crypto market cap is $2.24 trillion, which is a 5.89 per cent increase over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $129.10 billion, which makes a 0.99 per cent decrease. The total volume in DeFi is currently $15.84 billion, 12.27 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins is now $97.60 billion, which is 75.61 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.

“Bitcoin is officially on track to become a legal tender in El Salvador in the coming days. (by September 7th). Customarily, any such major update is often met with resistance. Consequently, certain volatility is expected in the coming week. For the third time in a couple of weeks, Ethereum tried to break out of a bull flag pattern on the daily charts and met with rejection at the flag’s resistance. The bulls appear to be collectively ready to breach that resistance and would only be a matter of time unless Bitcoin drags the market downhill,” Siddharth Menon, COO WazirX said.

Cryptocurrency experts believe it will surpass traditional finance in Australia as early as 2029 after a new report revealed the country had accumulated $7bn worth of digital coins.

Comparison site Finder has released its annual Cryptocurrency Report with some significant revelations, including that 31 per cent of Gen Z Australians (born after 1997) own some form of crypto.

Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital forms of money that take on the form of tokens or “coins” using cryptography, making it difficult to be counterfeited.

Australians have amassed $7bn worth of cryptocurrency, with the average investor owning $2078 in assets.

Overall, 17 per cent of Australians own cryptocurrency, while a further 13 per cent said they intended to buy it within the next year.

A nationally representative Finder survey also found 56 per cent of Australians believed tech billionaire Elon Musk invented Bitcoin.

Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, owned by 9 per cent of Australian crypto investors, followed by Ethereum (8 per cent), Dogecoin (5 per cent) and Bitcoin Cash (4 per cent).

The biggest revelation out of Finder’s report is that almost 31 per cent of Gen Z Australians (aged 24 and under) own cryptocurrency, and that figure has more than doubled since January.

But ownership of digital coins has dropped in other generations.

Finder’s cryptocurrency expert James Edwards said Gen Z’s behaviour was a sign traditional finance was being phased out in a bold prediction for its future.

“Many Aussies are now much more clear on the benefits cryptocurrencies offer, such as Bitcoin being a hedge against fiat currency and inflation, plus the ability to earn interest on assets through things like stablecoins and decentralised finance on Ethereum,” he said.

Fred Schebesta says the growth in cryptocurrency will explode.

“If the pace of education continues to grow, combined with easier access to cryptocurrencies, we should expect to see it as a dominant financial industry by the end of the decade, especially among younger generations who have never had meaningful access to traditional finance.”

Finder founder Fred Schebesta also predicted digital coins were about to explode.

“As the technology develops and there are easier ways to access it – like in the Finder app where you can buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in a few clicks – I believe the growth in cryptocurrency will explode,” he said.

The report emphasised social media will underpin the growth of cryptocurrencies.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/80971fc577bc8a4140540022df38d45e',)",none

Altcoins is a cumulative term to define cryptocurrencies that came after bitcoin.

Bitcoin hit a record of almost $65,000 in April, driven by a tide of liquidity, fast-money bets and optimism about growing demand from institutional investors. Supportive views from billionaire Elon Musk and the direct listing of digital-currency platform Coinbase Global Inc. also fueled optimism.

NEW DELHI: World’s second largest cryptocurrency network by way of market capitalization, Ethereum , split into two chains or versions.The split happened due to the failure of the older Go Ethereum (Geth) nodes to upgrade to ‘Hades Gamma' patch. The patch was released on 24th August after a bug was detected in mid-August 2020 in the 1.10.7 version of Ethereum network Go Ethereum updated its users on Twitter on August 27 about the split and the complete resolution of security vulnerability with its 1.10.8 version. It asked users to update their nodes having Hades Gamma patch to the current version if they haven't done so already.Geth is a command line interface for running Ethereum nodes implemented in Go language. Geth helps the users to join Ethereum network, transfer amounts between accounts, and mine ether.Information on the blockchain is stored on the network in chains of transactions.As they become verified, each transaction is added to the digital ledger.In the case of a split in the chain, all the transactions will not be verified by all the nodes. The split is a cause of concern for Ethereum investors or Ethereum-based applications.It increases the chances of double spend,where a single transaction is registered more than once thus allowing users to misrepresent their amount in the wallet.Almost 38 per cent of Ethereum Network nodes were using older Geth versions. Andre Cronje, the founder of Yearn Finance told users to stop doing transactions until the issue is fixed or if the users have updated to the latest Geth version.Impact of the split will likely be less, as more nodes are updating to Geth 1.10.8 version on an ongoing basis.The security lead for Ethereum Foundation , Martin Swende said, informing about the forking,that most miners were updated and fortunately the latest version is the longest node.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85833686,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-38990,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-30,NDTV.com,"What Is The Difference Between NFTs, Cryptocurrency And Digital Currency?",https://www.ndtv.com/business/nfts-cryptocurrency-and-digital-currency-how-do-they-stack-up-against-each-other-2525054,"Cryptocurrency runs on blockchain technology that records and stores data on all transactions

The world is slowly shifting from traditional modes of the transaction to digital wallets which hold both, fiat currency as well as cryptocurrency. With many options to pick from, it is important to know the difference between the various forms of currency. Digital currency is nothing but the electronic form of fiat money that is issued by governments. Cryptocurrency, meanwhile, is a non-physical currency that is issued by a private system. It is decentralised, not regulated by any governing authority and runs on blockchain technology. NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens are digital assets that denote real-world items like music, art, memes, fashion, etc. From collectible sports cards to memes, NFTs can represent any entity or be used to monetize any skill.

Digital Currency

To put it simply, digital currency is the electronic form of real-world money. A person can buy products, conduct transactions using digital currency in any part of the world even though digital currency does not have any real-world physical presence. While digital currency does not require encryption, users will need to use unique and secure passwords to protect their digital wallets from theft or hacking.

Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency runs on blockchain technology that records and stores data on all transactions made in a public ledger that can be accessible to anyone. It is a decentralised system, that is independent of any centralised regulation. All transactions are recorded in a decentralised ledger that is available to everyone to see, nullifying the need for a central authority. Unlike digital currency, it is protected by strong encryption.

Non-Fungible Tokens

NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets that represent real-world items. NFTs are not interchangeable and are different from cryptocurrencies which are fungible tokens. This means that NFTs cannot be traded the way cryptocurrencies are. NFTs are managed by a digital ledger and all transactions are done online.

How Are They Different From Each Other?

The primary difference between the three is that unlike cryptocurrency and digital currency, NFTs cannot be traded for each other as they are unique representations of real-world assets. Cryptocurrencies and digital currencies can be traded for each other as there will be no loss to their value.

Digital currencies are centralised and are regulated by authorities like banks and governments that keep a track of the transactions that take place. Cryptocurrency and NFTs are decentralised and are regulated by the communities that run them.

Unlike Cryptocurrency and NFTs that are accessible through a digital public ledger making all transactions transparent, digital currencies are private and information based on transactions and all money transfers are confidential.","('https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-01/cryptocurrency_650x400_61516192274.jpg',)",none

Billionaire John Paulson says cryptocurrencies are a bubble, will prove to be worthless



Cryptocurrencies, despite being considered among the market's hot commodities, have drawn sharp criticism from billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson who described it as a ""bubble"" that would prove to be ""worthless"". Paulson, while speaking at an episode of 'Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein' aired on August 30, said there is no intrinsic value attached with cryptocurrencies except for a ""limited amount"". The segment is ""too volatile"", he said, pointing out that Bitcoin went from US$5,000 to US$45,000 within a short period. Read it here.

2021-08-30,TechCrunch,Offchain Labs raises $120 million to fix Ethereum’s shortcomings with its Arbitrum product – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/offchain-labs-raises-120-million-to-hide-ethereums-shortcomings-with-arbitrum-scaling-product/,"As the broader crypto world enjoys a late summer surge in enthusiasm, more and more blockchain developers who have taken the plunge are bumping into the blaring scaling issues faced by decentralized apps on the Ethereum blockchain. The network has seen its popularity explode in the past year, but its transaction volume has stayed frustratingly stable as the network continues to operate near its limits, leading to slower transaction speeds and hefty fees on the crowded chain.

Ethereum’s core developers have been planning significant upgrades to the blockchain to rectify these issues, but even in the crypto world’s early stages, transitioning the network is a daunting, lengthy task. That’s why developers are looking to so-called Layer 2 rollup scaling solutions, which sit on top of the Ethereum network and handle transactions separately in a cheaper, faster way, while still recording the transactions to the Ethereum blockchain, albeit in batches.

The Layer 2 landscape is early, but crucial to the continued scalability of Ethereum. As a result, there’s been quite a bit of passionate chatter among blockchain developers regarding the early players in the space. Offchain Labs has been developing one particularly hyped rollup network called Arbitrum One, which has built up notable support and momentum since it beta-launched to developers in May, with about 350 teams signing up for access, the company says.

They’ve attracted some high-profile partnerships, including Uniswap and Chainlink, which have promised early support for the solution. The company has also quickly piqued investor interest. The startup tells TechCrunch it raised a $20 million Series A in April of this year, quickly followed up by a $100 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, which closed this month and valued the company at $1.2 billion. Other new investors include Polychain Capital, Ribbit Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Pantera Capital, Alameda Research and Mark Cuban.

It’s been a fairly lengthy ride for the Arbitrum technology to public access. The tech was first developed at Princeton — you can find a YouTube video where the tech is first discussed in earnest back in early 2015. Longtime professor Ed Felten and his co-founders CEO Steven Goldfeder and CTO Harry Kalodner detailed a deeper underlying vision in a 2018 research paper before licensing the tech from Princeton and building out the company. Felten previously served as the deputy U.S. chief technology officer in the Obama White House, and — alongside Goldfeder — authored a top textbook on cryptocurrencies.

After a lengthy period under wraps and a few months of limited access, the startup is ready to publicly launch the Arbitrum One mainnet, they tell TechCrunch.

This team’s scaling solution has few direct competitors — a16z-backed Optimism is its most notable rival — but Arbitrum’s biggest advantage is likely the smooth compatibility it boasts with decentralized applications designed to run on Ethereum, compared with competitors that may require more heavy-lifting on the developer’s part to be fully compatible with their rollup solution. That selling point could be a big one as Arbitrum looks to court support across the Ethereum network and crypto exchanges for its product, though most Ethereum developers are well aware of what’s at stake broadly.

“There’s just so much more demand than there is supply on Ethereum,” Goldfeder tells TechCrunch. “Rollups give you the security derived from Ethereum but a much better experience in terms of costs.”","('https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS-5.jpg?w=533',)",none

Bitcoin's price dropped another 2.82 percent to $47,055. Ether was up 0.83 percent at $3218.52. Despite record accumulation and supply shock events, Bitcoin's price drops to $46.7K. Bitcoin prices have risen sharply as a result of several favorable occurrences, but comments made by well-known persons about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, in general, are dragging it down.

Cardano

During the most recent ADA price spike, Cardano (ADA) addresses with a balance of more than $1 million had risen 173 percent.

After bottoming out at $1.007 on July 20, the ADA/USD exchange rate climbed about 200 percent. In the previous session, the pair hit a new high of $3.02, which was followed by a 6.42 percent price drop to $2.73 at the time of writing.

Pay Pal

After establishing bitcoin trading services last year, PayPal is apparently looking into ways to offer stock trading.

According to a report published on Aug. 30, PayPal is trying to buy or collaborate with a broker-dealer to launch its own stock trading service to compete with rivals such as crypto-friendly stock trading software Robinhood.

NFT

After seeing the hype about Dogecoin (DOGE), which was mostly spearheaded by Elon Musk, Naomi Osaka, a top professional tennis player from Japan, has been outspoken about diversifying her assets in cryptocurrencies.

CBDC

Bitt Inc, a Barbados-based fintech startup, would serve as the Central Bank of Nigeria's technical partner for the proposed e-naira digital money.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said on Monday that it has picked Bitt Inc because of its ""technical competence, efficiency, platform security, interoperability, and implementation experience.""

2021-08-30,Forbes,Solana Skyrockets To New High—Amassing Nearly $40 Billion In Market Value As Competition With Ethereum Heats Up,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/08/31/solana-skyrockets-to-new-high-above-130-amassing-nearly-40-billion-in-market-value-as-competition-with-ethereum-heats-up/,"Topline

Though the broader cryptocurrency market was virtually flat Tuesday, nascent token Solana tacked on to an explosive rally, hitting a new all-time high above $130 thanks to growing investor fervor around the Ethereum competitor's platform, which also supports the smart contracts necessary for booming decentralized finance applications and non-fungible tokens.

Now the world’s eighth-largest cryptocurrency, Solana has soared nearly 220% over the past month. getty

Key Facts

The price of Solana soared nearly 30% to a high of $130.01 on Tuesday morning, lifting its seven-day gains to more than 67% and giving the token, which debuted only 18 months ago, a market capitalization of about $38 billion. “Popular altcoin Solana has reaffirmed its status as an outlier in the market,” Jonas Luethy, a trader at London-based cryptocurrency broker GlobalBlock, wrote in a Monday email, noting Solana was by far the best-performing top-ten cryptocurrency over the past week. Now the world’s eighth-largest cryptocurrency, Solana skyrocketed 10% Monday and has climbed a staggering 6,800% this year alone—eclipsing the gains of other top cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether and Cardano’s ada—up 63%, 372% and 1,160%, respectively. Luethy pointed to the booming popularity of NFTs, the blockchain-based digital art collectibles increasingly gaining traction among celebrities, as the catalyst behind Solana’s rally. According to Luethy, NFT sales in August have already hit a record of about $900 million, more than triple their previous best month in May. Over the weekend, Solana hit another milestone: The value of decentralized finance projects—which have caught the eye of regulators—pinned to the token’s blockchain surpassed $3 billion for the first time ever, nearly tripling this month alone.

Tangent

In a report on Monday, crypto investment firm CoinShares revealed investors have increasingly been selling off bitcoin funds, in favor of investments tied to other cryptocurrencies. For the first time ever, Solana funds led investment growth earlier this month, tacking on more than $7 million in the week ending August 20, compared to $3.2 million for Ethereum and a loss of $2.8 million for Bitcoin. Investment strategist James Butterfill noted Solano’s more flexible software and faster transaction speed, compared to larger rival Ethereum, has helped it gain traction among investors and software developers.

Key Background

Solana’s stunning rally this past week has headlined growth among a slew of so-called altcoins, or cryptocurrency alternatives to market leaders bitcoin and ether. Solana’s support for smart contracts has helped it take advantage of the buzz around NFTs and DeFi, but other players have signaled plans to dive into the space as well, with Cardano, for example, planning to launch a software upgrade next month in order to begin processing smart contracts.

What To Watch For

Regulation. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler hasn’t been too keen on the growing popularity of DeFi, saying at a conference last month that the sector isn't immune to regulation. Last week, the agency signed a six-figure deal with blockchain analytics firm AnChain.AI to help it investigate DeFi transactions. “The SEC is very keen on understanding what is happening in the world of smart contract-based digital assets,” AnChain CEO and cofounder Victor Fang told Forbes.

Surprising Fact

Though its price has soared 255% over the past month, Solana plunged nearly 60% this summer as the broader cryptocurrency market crashed amid intensifying regulations in China.

At eighth place, Solana falls just behind Dogecoin, which is worth $36 billion. Why is Solana surging? This is always a hard question to answer. Though Solana is holding some kind of mysterious “Ignition” event today. Nasdaq notes that some industry watchers have speculated that Solana might announce that it will “burn” tokens. That’s when a certain number of coins are removed from supply, making the remaining ones more scarce and thus more valuable. Alternately, Solana could be set to announce new smart contract features.

Update: Solana has announced the Ignition event is an upcoming virtual hackathon with up to $5 million in seed funding and prizes.","('https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2021/08/P-1-90671003-solana-cryptocurrency-heres-why-the-ethereum-competitor-is-surging.jpg',)",none

2021-08-30,Analytics Insight,Top Profitable Cryptocurrencies to Buy in September 2021,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-profitable-cryptocurrencies-to-buy-in-september-2021/,"Top Profitable Cryptocurrencies to Buy in September 2021

These cryptocurrencies show promising growth and high returns in the long run.

Cryptocurrencies are growing to become stronger investment options as months go by. In August, Bitcoin reached closer to its all-time high of US$60,000 by reaching US$50,000. Keeping an eye on the crypto trends and headlines, the bullish run is giving several traders the confidence to buy more cryptocurrencies. For that, Analytics Insight has made this of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this weekend.

1. Bitcoin

The first half of 2021 saw the crypto market crash and Bitcoin becoming half of its all-time high to US$30,000. In August, the price bounced back and now Bitcoin is trading at the value of US$47,000. This price drop is a good sign for new crypto investors who want to buy Bitcoins and reap the profits.

2. Ethereum

Next to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency. Its blockchain network revolutionized the DeFi sector and made way for decentralized apps. Recently, Ethereum launched its much-awaited new update that will improve the transaction fees and reduce Ether’s inflation. This change makes it easy for investors to decipher the value of investing in Ether and give miners a fair fee.

3. XRP

XRP is one of the most popular utility tokens in the market. Created by Ripple, XRP’s blockchain platform aims to set up cross-border currencies without any friction. Since its launch, many banks have realized the capabilities of this token and the volume of transactions on this network has increased since then. One of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to buy, XRP has a bright future in the crypto market.

4. Tether

As a stable coin, Tether is unlike most cryptocurrencies in the market. A stable coin is a digital token that has a fixed value and is pegged to a fiat currency, like the Euro or the Dollar. Similarly, Tether has a fixed value of US$1 or equivalent and maintains US$1 in reserve for each Tether issued.

5. USD Coin

USD Coin is a more popular stable coin as its value is only pegged to the US dollar. Stable coins withstand market volatility better and offer a more risk-free investment option. This is apt for new investors who want to make their first move in the market.

6. Cardano

Cardano is known for its proof-of-stake network. Its open blockchain platform is open-source and decentralized. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its native token, Ada. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies to invest in.

7. Dogecoin

Dogecoin, originally made as a meme, has become a legit cryptocurrency with high potential. It has made enough headlines, thanks to Elon Musk’s obsession with making cryptocurrencies trending. All the hype played in favor of this coin and its value that grew more than 50% since its inception. It’s also one of the cheapest cryptocurrencies to invest in.

8. Binance Coin

Binance Coin is a token native to the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. As long as there is activity on the Binance exchange, Binance coin will continue to steadily grow. Ranked among the top six cryptocurrencies in the world, Binance coin can be used to trade other cryptocurrencies as well.

9. Litecoin

Litecoin is a rival for Bitcoin’s blockchain network. Litecoin aims to pay for everyday goods and services with transactions faster than Bitcoin. Litecoin has been recognized for its practical purpose by market experts and trade merchants. This means Litecoin is a crypto that can suddenly take on a bull run.

10. NEO

Similar to Ethereum, NEO is a platform for smart contracts. Launched in 2014, NEO’s mission is to improve Ethereum’s network by offering the same utility functions via a more sophisticated blockchain. While NEOs network is superior to Ethereum, it will only reach its full potential in a couple of years. The wait will be worth it for investors.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Top-Profitable-Cryptocurrencies-to-Buy-in-September.jpg',)",none

The Central Bank announced plans to launch its own digital currency later this year after Nigeria barred banks and financial institutions from dealing in or facilitating transactions in cryptocurrencies in February.

Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele has said the eNaira would operate as a wallet against which customers can hold existing funds in their bank account. In a statement on Monday, Emefiele said the currency would accelerate financial inclusion and enable cheaper and faster remittance inflows.

Barbados-based Bitt earlier this year led development of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union's ""DCash"", the first digital cash issued by a currency union central bank.

In related news, the first cryptocurrency ATM opened in Honduras last week as Bitcoin backers sought to spur demand for virtual assets after neighbouring El Salvador became the first country to establish Bitcoin as legal tender. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.83 lakhs as of 11am on August 31.

The machine, locally dubbed ""la bitcoinera,"" allows users to acquire Bitcoin and Ethereum using the local lempira currency and was installed in an office tower in the capital of Tegucigalpa by Honduran firm TGU Consulting Group. Ethereum price in India stood at Rs. 2.53 lakhs as of 11am IST on August 31.

2021-08-30,News.com.au,What are solana and fantom as the cryptocurrencies’ prices surge,https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/what-are-solana-and-fantom-as-the-cryptocurrencies-prices-surge/news-story/5b16dd0725d57cd76480c3925dbd95d8,"Two new cryptocurrencies, called solana and fantom, have recorded huge spikes in price. Find out about the new rivals to bitcoin.

Two new cryptos are making waves with solana hitting an all time market value high of $US30 billion ($A41 billion), while fantom exploded in value to $US600 million ($A822 million).

Both relatively new entrants are considered strong competitors against one of the most popular cryptos, ethereum, as well as bitcoin.

Solana prices spiked by 12 per cent on Monday reaching a price of $US103.72 ($A142.22), while fantom soared by 70 per cent in just one day to trade at $US0.87 ($A1.19).

Here’s more on the new cryptos.

When did solana and fantom debut?

Solana only launched 18 months ago, but is now the world’s eighth largest cryptocurrency with a market value of around $US30 billion ($A41 billion). Its price has risen by 37 per cent in the last week alone and this year its shot up by a massive 70 per cent.

Fantom has grown by more than 340 per cent in the last 30 days. It could be heading back up to its all-time high price of $US0.94 ($A1.29), which it hit back in May before the crypto market crash.

It went live at December 2019, but most of its core features weren’t introduced until the end of last year.

Who are behind the cryptos?

Solana’s most prominent founder is a former software engineer for Dropbox named Anatoly Yakovenko.

One of his big aims was to differentiate the coin by a proof of history feature, meaning it can record transactions and the time that has passed between them, boosting the trust in the blockchain story.

He helped solana raise $US25 million in public and private funding rounds back in 2017 to fund the digital coin.

Fantom was founded in early 2018 by South Korean man Ahn Byung Ik, who has a PhD in computer science and has already led several successful start-ups. There are reports he is no longer associated with the crypto, due to strict regulations in South Korea.

The idea behind fantom was to create a crypto that would be suitable for smart cities with the ambitious goal of offering a processing speed of 300,000 transactions per second.

How many coins are in circulation?

For solana, there’s a total of 489 million coins planned for release, with around 260 million already in the market.

But 60 per cent of these coins are controlled by the project’s founders and its foundation, with only 38 per cent reserved for the community.

There are currently 2.5 billion fantom coins circulating out of a maximum supply of 3.1 billion.

Like bitcoin, there are a limited number of tokens available. Picture: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images

What are the price changes this year?

Solana has had an impressive rise starting the year trading at less than $US1.85 ($A2.54), but now jumped past the $US100 ($A137) mark. It means solana has posted more than a 3600 per cent gain this year alone.

Fantom hit a low of $US0.15 ($A0.21) on July 20, but it rocketed 500 per cent to $US0.90 ($A1.23) on Monday as its 24-hour trading volume exploded by 1250 per cent to a record $US1.26 billion ($A1.73 billion).

Why the huge spikes in value?

Prices have spiked because of the use of technology called smart contract blockchains and the projects it can host, alongside offering bank-grade security.

Basically people can use the tech on projects such as decentralised finance and trading, lending and digital collectibles like NFTs.

Jonas Luethy, a trader at London-based cryptocurrency broker GlobalBlock, said the booming popularity of NFTs, which are starting to catch the eye of celebrities, was the catalyst behind solana’s rally.

He said NFT sales in August hit a record of about $US900 million ($A1.23 billion).

For fantom, there are reports it hosts 200,000 daily transactions and has over 77,000 digital wallets on the platform.

What’s driving solana’s worth?

Solana’s decentralised finance projects have also tripled in value in August alone, surpassing $US3 billion ($A4.1 billion) for the first time ever.

The digital coin is also said to be a threat to ethereum as its tech is more flexible, cheaper and offers faster transaction speeds. On its website, it boasts it can process 50,000 transactions per second through its tech.

Over the past week, solana has also picked up more than $US7 million ($A9.6 million) in net investment, according to crypto investment firm CoinShares, compared to a loss of $US2.8 million ($A3.8 million) for bitcoin.

Experts noted that solana was the only cryptocurrency in the top 10 rising in value over the past 24 hours

What about China’s influence on crypto?

While solana’s price skyrocketed nearly 220 per cent over the past month, it took a dive of nearly 60 per cent amid the crypto market crash due to regulations in China.

The US regulator is also investigating the cryptocurrency market and the tech behind it, which could be a threat to their growing popularity.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/808ca1864fa81f99eb9c23ec082cb77f',)",none
2021-08-30,,Payments: Kerala firm opts for cryptocurrency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/payments-kerala-firm-opts-for-cryptocurrency/articleshow/85780181.cms,"Kochi: Athey Nallatha , a Kerala startup that sells fusion pickles to the domestic as well as a global clientele, becomes the first company in Kerala which is ready to accept cryptocurrency for its payments. It is also the seventh firm in India to enter into cryptocurrency-based transactions, the startup claimed.On Aug 28, 2021, the startup opened its payment gateway by CoinBase to customers. Digital currencies accepted on this portal are Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, DAI, and USDC, though a transaction is yet to happen.When questioned why they included cryptocurrency as a mode of payment, apart from cards, UPI and Google Pay, while it is yet to gain popularity in the country, Akshay Raveendran, co-founder and director, Athey Nallatha said, “The promoters have been involved with cryptocurrency right from the inception itself – we used to keep track and invest in them. Also, if we implement blockchain technology on the operations side, it is going to save us a lot of money and customers are also going to benefit from this. There are major scaling plans but as a starting step, we have done this.”Interestingly, the startup doesn’t accept cash due to the pandemic. Founded in June 2020, during the pandemic, by two management graduates Hafez Rahman and Akshay Raveendran, Athey Nallatha also aims at providing employment opportunities to mothers.“We source vegetables and meat products from local farmers in and around Kochi. And during the initial days of the pandemic, we couldn’t group the people to work together at a single place to process these raw materials. Hence, we distributed the jobs between various groups of women. While one group took care of vegetable peeling, another took care of cleaning fish. Finally, we collected the products and brought them to a centralized kitchen where it was prepared,” Raveendran said.At present, Athey Nallatha employs 70 women from Panangad, Paravur or Tripunithura – places in and around Kochi. And a number of farmers around Kochi benefitted from local sourcing. “We wanted to stimulate the local economy. During the initial days of Covid, the inter-state trade was disrupted and farmers were affected. So, we decided to source locally only,” said Raveendran.Athey Nallatha sells its products online through its website and Amazon. It also sells them via 30 retail stores. For serving the Middle Eastern clientele, the startup is tying up with online portal Noon.com. Raveendran said he got the first direct order from Germany and the shipments are going soon.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Crypto Market Develops in DeFi, Payments, Compliance and Consumer Adoption

By Veronica Reynolds and Robert A. Musiala Jr.

A large institutional financial and media conglomerate recently announced a partnership with a major financial services and investment management company that specializes in digital assets, with the two companies offering the public the opportunity to invest in a decentralized finance (DeFi) index. Uniswap, Aave, Maker and Compound are a few of the DeFi protocols included in the index. The financial services and investment management company also announced its new DeFi Index Fund – its own separate “passively managed fund tracking the performance of DeFi.”

This week, Chainalysis introduced the Chainalysis Global DeFi Adoption Index, “a new geographic index ranking countries by DeFi adoption” that focuses on “grassroots adoption by individuals, rather than those sending the largest raw values of funds.” The index ranks 154 countries according to three criteria: (1) on-chain cryptocurrency value received by DeFi platforms, weighted by purchasing power parity per capita; (2) total retail value received by DeFi platforms; and (3) individual deposits to DeFi platforms. The top five ranked countries, in order, are the United States, Vietnam, Thailand, China and the United Kingdom.

According to recent reports, a major U.S. technology firm has been awarded a patent for software designed to “help users develop blockchain applications by making it easier and more efficient to create crypto tokens for different distributed ledgers.” And in a development from the Bitcoin ATM industry, this week, a group of Bitcoin ATM operators announced the formation of the Cryptocurrency Compliance Cooperative, with a mission to “legitimize the cash-to-cryptocurrency industry by bolstering compliance standards.”

In a final item of note, growing consumer interest in cryptocurrency was highlighted in three recent surveys. Findings from the surveys include the following:

In one survey, respondents on average planned to invest $1,645 in cryptocurrency in the coming year and to hold on to their crypto for an average of five years.

In another survey, 60 percent of respondents viewed cryptocurrency as a long-term investment, and 11 percent of U.S. respondents purchased cryptocurrency with their COVID-19 stimulus checks.

A third survey found that Africa’s peer-to-peer bitcoin trading volume is close to $17 million and is now the largest in the world, exceeding that of North America.

Market Navigation, Fashion Metaverse, Online Tutorials: NFT Adoption Continues

By Lauren Bass

Last week, an international digital payments corporation partnered with the first federally chartered digital asset bank to purchase the non-fungible token (NFT) CryptoPunk 7610. According to reports, the $150,000 transaction, which marked the corporation’s first foray into digital collectibles, was designed to help the company navigate this emerging marketplace and understand “what it takes to acquire, custody and interact with an NFT.”

Earlier this week, a U.S. beer company reportedly purchased NFT artwork featuring its own branded content. According to reports, the company then used the digital image as its profile picture on social media. The recent NFT sale follows the beer magnate’s earlier purchase of the Beer.eth domain name through OpenSea’s Ethereum Name Service.

In other NFT news, a major luxury fashion publication will reportedly launch an interactive fashion metaverse via a scannable QR code embedded in the magazine’s September print cover. According to reports, this digital world will feature two magazine covers, each to be released as a limited-edition NFT, as well as unique interactive online experiences. The publication will also reportedly release 15 NFTs featuring digital-only fashion wear, beauty and design products. The NFTs will be available for purchase on Brytehall, a newly launched NFT platform on the Binance Smart Chain.

To encourage the creation of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum.org has published a tutorial that describes the step-by-step process necessary to generate and release an NFT. The three-part series teaches readers how to (i) write and deploy an ERC-721 smart contract, (ii) mint an NFT, and (iii) view the finished NFT on the Ethereum network.

Crypto Compliance Addressed by CFTC, Thai SEC, South Korea and UK FCA

By Teresa Goody Guillén

Commissioner Dawn Stump of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a statement this week addressing the CFTC’s regulatory and enforcement authority over digital assets. Among other things, the commissioner stated that the CFTC does not regulate commodities, but rather, it regulates derivatives. The statement outlined 10 points clarifying how and what the CFTC regulates and distinguished its regulatory versus enforcement authority.

This week, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand (Thai SEC) proposed additional regulations related to the custody of investors’ cryptocurrency holdings held by digital asset business operators, citing investor protection concerns. The regulations address custody of fiat money, fiat money and digital assets, and seeking benefits from clients’ assets. Among other things, the Thai SEC is specifically proposing to prohibit crypto companies from using investor assets for the “benefit of another client or other persons,” and it proposes a new framework for the withdrawal and transfer of fiat money from digital asset accounts, requiring compliance with the principles of “decentralized approval authority, multi-sign approval authority, and check and balance.” The Thai SEC is accepting public comments on the newly proposed regulations until Sept. 22.

All South Korean crypto exchanges have reportedly failed their regulatory “consulting” audits. In June, the regulatory Financial Services Commission (FSC) collaborated with government ministries and state-owned IT firms to conduct a “complete investigation of corporate accounts” and crypto exchanges’ “coin management and investor protection” protocols. The FSC reportedly found that out of 33 exchanges, 25 had gained information security management system accreditation, anti-money laundering protocols were still “lacking” at most exchanges, and none of the trading platforms had obtained the required real name-authenticated banking contracts they will need to continue doing business after Sept. 24. Finally, in news from the U.K., a June notice from the Blockchain Blog Image Request Financial Conduct Authority to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance was made public this week. Among other things, the notice found that the exchange was “not capable of being effectively supervised.”

SEC, DOJ and Ontario Securities Commission Bring Crypto Enforcement Actions

By Keith R. Murphy

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) obtained judgments against three individual defendants in connection with their roles with BitConnect and its “lending program,” according to a recent press release. The charges among the various defendants included offering and selling securities without registering the securities offering with the SEC, aiding and abetting that unregistered securities offering, and unjust enrichment. The press release notes that thus far the defendants collectively have been ordered to pay $3.5 million and 190 bitcoin in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with one defendant still awaiting court determination of the amount he will owe.

In related news, the Ontario Securities Commission recently issued a notice to a Seychelles-based fintech company operating the OKEx cryptocurrency exchange, asserting that the products it offers are considered securities and derivatives and thus are subject to Ontario securities law. The notice alleges the company failed to comply with Ontario’s registration and prospectus requirements, and it recommends various penalties, including prohibiting certain activities of the exchange and financial penalties.

The inventor of cryptocurrency AriseCoin has been sentenced to five years in prison for defrauding investors out of more than $4 million, according to a United States Department of Justice press release this week. In connection with his guilty plea, the defendant reportedly admitted lying to prospective investors, including representing that his similarly named AriseBank could offer Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured accounts and traditional banking services such as Visa-branded credit cards and use the money from investors to fund his personal life.

A recently unsealed federal indictment alleges that a dark web drug dealer going by the name of Xanaxman has been laundering nearly $140 million of bitcoin while serving time in a Maryland prison. The defendant is already serving a nearly five-year prison term for dark web sales activities and was previously ordered to forfeit thousands of bitcoin. In connection with the recent charges, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration reportedly has seized 2,934 bitcoin since February.

Reports Released on Crypto Scams and Malware, Poly Hacker Returns Funds

By Joanna F. Wasick

According to recent findings by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Australians have lost over $70 million to scams in the first six months of this year. More than half of these losses were reportedly due to cryptocurrency scams, many involving a simple setup, where the scammer lies to investors about having an innovative, profitable trading system, when in fact no such system exists and investments are just stolen. Scam-related bitcoin losses were reportedly up 44 percent from last year.

An analysis out earlier this month found that a new type of malware involving a social engineering-based “malvertising” campaign is targeting users in Japan. The application masquerades as either an animated porn game, a reward points application or a video streaming application, and then delivers a malicious application that deploys a Cinobi banking trojan to steal cryptocurrency account credentials. The operation is attributed to Water Kappa, a threat actor that previously targeted Japanese banking users. In related news, last week, Trend Micro, an enterprise data security and cybersecurity company, discovered eight deceptive mobile apps masquerading as cryptocurrency cloud mining applications. The apps trick victims into watching ads, paying for subscription services and paying for increased mining capabilities without getting anything in return.

The hacker who took more than $600 million from the Poly Network platform on Aug. 10, has released the private key for the remaining $141 million after returning the rest of the funds earlier this month. The Poly Network later tweeted its thanks for the return and posted a link to a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, confirming that the key worked.

2021 Global Blockchain Survey Focuses on Views of Financial Services Leaders

By Robert A. Musiala Jr.

This week, a Big Four accounting and consulting firm published its 2021 Global Blockchain Survey. The survey focused on the global financial services industry (FSI) and finds that “global FSI leaders see digital assets … as a strategic priority.” According to the survey, “80% of overall respondents say that digital assets will be ‘very/somewhat important’ to their respective industries in the next 24 months.” The survey polled a sample of 1,280 senior executives in 10 locations: Brazil, Mainland China, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States. Some key findings from the survey include the following from FSI respondents:

83 percent agree there is a compelling business case for blockchain, digital assets and/or cryptocurrencies within their organization or project.

83 percent report that their business partners, suppliers, customers and/or competitors are discussing working on blockchain, digital assets and/or cryptocurrencies in the context of solutions or strategies.

80 percent agree their industry will see new revenue streams from blockchain, digital asset and/or cryptocurrency solutions.

77 percent agree that their organization will lose an opportunity for competitive advantage if they fail to adopt blockchain and digital assets.

76 percent strongly or somewhat believe digital assets will be a strong alternative to or replacement for fiat currencies in the next 10 years.

The top expected roles of digital assets in FSI organizations were custody of digital assets, new payment channels, tokenization of assets and access to decentralized finance platforms.

The top reported barriers to digital asset acceptance were financial infrastructure, cybersecurity and regulatory barriers.

2021-08-30,Business Standard,Hottest cryptocurrencies are alternatives to Bitcoin and Ether,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/hottest-cryptocurrencies-are-alternatives-to-bitcoin-and-ether-121083100046_1.html,"FOMO remains alive and well in the cryptocurrency world, with lesser-known tokens outperforming again in the wake of recent rallies staged by industry leaders and Ether.



Cardano has doubled this month, becoming the third-largest digital asset. Binance Coin is also up. A token named Avalanche has tripled in August. Meanwhile, prices for digital photos of rocks with laser eyes and cartoon depictions of cute animals are going gangbusters, sometimes quadrupling in a matter of days.

Among analysts and investors, there’s little consensus as to what’s driving parts of the frenzy. Some posit that speculators are moving from the mainstays to newer, more exciting offshoots, as they often do after big runs. Others see a world awash in cash and ultra-low rates, which ultimately pushes investors toward ever-wonkier assets. A few tokens are backed by strong narratives, such as technological advances at the Cardano and Solana networks.

“There’s no doubt that there’s a lot of excitement in crypto,” said Yoni Assia, founder and chief executive of online exchange eToro. “You can definitely see it within the numbers in the industry, whether it’s looking at total volumes or looking at growth of companies,” he said, adding that “we’ve seen a lot of exuberance in the market.”





Assia calls it a “generational buying moment” and cites a confluence of events, including rock-bottom interest rates worldwide, as well as massive fiscal stimulus efforts that delivered checks to many people during the pandemic.

Some of that money has gone toward and related assets, such as stocks of digital miners. About 15% of Americans who received the first two stimulus checks invested part or all of the money, and about half of this group invested specifically in cryptocurrencies, according to a survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults conducted by The Harris Poll for Yahoo Finance.

At the same time, inflation has materialized as economies reopen, playing into the warnings from some crypto faithful of pending hyperinflation. Put all that together and it’s “leading a lot of people to look for various types of investments,” Assia said.

A recent survey by eToro found that roughly a quarter of the 6,000 investors queried own crypto, a number that increases to nearly 50% for the younger cohort. The company also found that the average investor was set to increase their crypto allocation in the coming months and that interest in alternatives to and Ether, or altcoins, is “significant.”

Meanwhile, downloads for crypto trading apps are rising -- Coinbase Global Inc. ranked 11th among finance apps in Apple’s iPhone downloads, according to App Annie, a mobile data and analytics provider. It averaged 23rd within its category last August. Digital exchanges Kraken, Voyager and Crypto.com have also advanced in the ranks.





“With all of this money floating around, we should not be surprised that there are people paying exorbitant amounts of money for digital pet rocks and an endless amount of other digital assets that can be easily created,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.

The space is dominated by younger generations, he said, and all they know is a Federal Reserve that’s been almost-perpetually accommodative. Take that, alongside a gridlocked government, and it’s no surprise many have gravitated toward the crypto space, he said.

Since July, assets under management for digital-asset investment products rose more than 57% to roughly $55 billion. Average daily aggregate trading volumes increased more than 46% to $544 million, the biggest month-over-month rise since May, according to data-tracker CryptoCompare.

A lot of the attention’s been placed on altcoins such as Cardano, Avalanche and the meme mainstay Dogecoin. Meantime, an index tracking some of the largest decentralized finance protocols and apps -- the Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index -- is up about 50% since the start of July.

“There’s generally been pretty positive crypto sentiment recently: NFTs have helped lead the revival, and the crash from May is further in the rearview mirror,” said Sam Bankman-Fried, chief executive officer of crypto exchange FTX.

And then there are the blockchains looking to compete with Ethereum. Avi Felman, co-portfolio manager at BlockTower Capital, said now that Ethereum’s recent network upgrade is done, speculators are turning their attention toward rival blockchains and their tokens.

Meanwhile, the U.S. equity markets seem to post records daily. Meme stocks are going bonkers too. Jason Urban, co-head of Galaxy Digital Trading, said when the market’s in a such a risk-on mood, crypto can only benefit.

In the four years ending in 2019, correlations between and daily returns for the S&P 500 were generally small, according to Wei Liang at DBS in Singapore. But starting last year, that changed. Amid the pandemic, Bitcoin and U.S. stocks have fallen and rebounded jointly, he said.

“Lately, you see people are concerned about inflation, people are concerned about money supply -- because of that, historically, people always said buy stocks as a hedge against inflation,” Urban said. Now, he added, it’s crypto as well.","('https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2021-08/31/full/1630353924-4152.jpg',)",none
2021-08-30,CNBC,Cryptocurrency investing has a big gender problem,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/cryptocurrency-has-a-big-gender-problem.html,"Cryptocurrency is a 21st century financial instrument with a very 20th century problem: not enough women. Twice as many men as women invest in cryptocurrency (16% of men vs. 7% of women), according to CNBC and Acorn's Invest in You: Next Gen Investor survey, conducted in partnership with Momentive. Women are lagging behind men in their rates of cryptocurrency investing, just as they have historically struggled to keep pace with men in more traditional investment verticals. In fact, in the new survey data, the gender disparity in crypto matches or exceeds the gender gaps in ownership of exchange-traded funds (14% of men vs. 7% of women), individual stocks (40% of men vs. 24% of women), mutual funds (30% of men vs. 20% of women), real estate (36% of men vs. 30% of women), and bonds (14% of men vs. 11% of women).

The survey was conducted for CNBC and Acorns by Momentive, the company formerly known as SurveyMonkey, from August 4-9, 2021, among more than 5,530 adults in the U.S., 2,980 of whom have investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, or cryptocurrency.

'Democratizing' investing and gender

Gender disparities have dogged the financial services industry for decades, but cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum, and dogecoin have been promoted as a way to democratize a traditionally walled-off field, welcoming new and more diverse investors into the fold. Only about one in 10 people in the U.S. (11%) currently invest in cryptocurrencies, but so far the industry has not been able to make inroads among the key demographic group of women. That's especially confounding because in other significant ways, cryptocurrency is really living up to its hype in leveling the playing field. Crypto is the only financial vertical that has a higher participation rate among younger adults than older adults: 15% of those 18 to 34 years old own cryptocurrencies, compared with 11% of those ages 35 to 64 and 4% of those 65 and older.

Even more interesting is that people of all races are about equally likely to own cryptocurrency: 11% of whites, 11% of Blacks, 10% of Hispanics, 14% of Asians, and 13% of people of another race all have crypto investments. Even though cryptocurrency has broken down barriers in investing by race, it hasn't managed to do the same by gender.

Black women face the highest investing barriers

Personal investing, and the world of finance in general, is notorious for its historic exclusion of women and people of color. For decades, women could not take out a loan, sign a mortgage, or even own a credit card without having a male co-signer. People of color, too, faced discrimination and systemic barriers to investing. The legacy of these discriminatory practices continues even through today. In the new survey results, Black women are about half as likely as Black men, one third as likely as white women, and one-fourth as likely as white men to own real estate. Similarly, just 51% of Black women say they have a traditional checking account, compared with 63% of Black men, 71% of white women and 78% of white men.

At the same time, Black women have by far the highest rates of student debt: 30% of Black women but just 17% of Black men, 16% of white women, and 13% of white men have student debt. As a still-nascent industry, cryptocurrency is well-positioned to avoid many of the discriminatory pitfalls the traditional investing world has inculcated over the years. Today's would-be investors have more accessible resources — social media channels, online trainings, and targeted marketing — that can get them involved in new or more traditional forms of investing.

Demographics as financial destiny

Without access to these more traditional financial instruments, Black women may feel shut out of the investing world altogether. Women of all races are equally likely to say nobody ever taught them about investing (28% among all women), but Black and Hispanic women still have lower rates of investing relative to white women.

2021-08-30,New Scientist,Will PayPal's adoption of bitcoin make cryptocurrency more mainstream?,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2288039-will-paypals-adoption-of-bitcoin-make-cryptocurrency-more-mainstream/,"Will the cryptocurrency be more widely used now that PayPal accepts it in the UK? mundissima / Alamy

PayPal has two decades of experience in online payments and manages 403 million user accounts. So, it caused ripples when it announced on 23 August it would allow UK customers to buy and sell four cryptocurrencies: bitcoin prices rose to a three-month high. But will this – and last October’s roll-out in the US – push cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, or is it just another blip in the short but volatile history of decentralised money?

Customers in the US who have bought cryptocurrencies through Paypal log in twice as often as those who haven’t, says Jose Fernandez da Ponte at PayPal. “We expect digital currencies to play an important role in consumer payments over the longer term,” he says.

Public interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is certainly growing, but only a minority have bought in. A YouGov survey revealed that by August 2019, just 3 per cent of people in the UK owned any cryptocurrencies. By July 2021 that had risen to 8 per cent.

Giving millions of existing PayPal customers the ability to buy at the click of a button has enormous potential for increasing those numbers, but access to the currency isn’t the only limiting factor. People need a way to spend it.

A handful of large companies, such as Microsoft, have begun accepting bitcoin as payment, and others such as electric car company Tesla have done so at times too. And while several other retailers, including grocery stores, coffee shops and hardware stores, have systems to accept cryptocurrency in some countries, using only this form of payment day-to-day would be no easy task.

PayPal users in the UK won’t be able to use cryptocurrency to buy goods or services – they can only buy, hold and sell the currency. But in the US, the company offers the ability to use balances for payments anywhere that accepts PayPal. This effectively allows hundreds of thousands of retailers to accept cryptocurrencies without having to make any changes or accept any risk, and receive US dollars from PayPal as normal.

This is vital, as the risk for businesses is high, says Carol Alexander at the University of Sussex, UK. Cryptocurrencies are “dominated by huge speculation and rampant manipulation”, she says.

Organised groups are able to cause swings in cryptocurrency values with coordinated buying or selling and, unlike the traditional financial services sector, there is little regulation to stop it. So, if you take bitcoin as payment directly, it may plummet in value before you convert it.

“I can’t see this as the moment crypto goes mainstream. The widespread market abuse needs addressing first,” says Alexander.

Cryptocurrencies are decentralised systems with no official oversight, so regulation is difficult. Registered companies that deal in them are finding themselves under increasing scrutiny. In June, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority ruled that Binance Markets Limited, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, had to cease regulated trading in the UK.

There are still hurdles to overcome before cryptocurrency can truly break into the mainstream, including its exorbitant energy use, volatility and complexity.

But some are still confident that the technology offers enough benefits, such as protection from inflation, a degree of anonymity and low fees for large payments, that widespread adoption is inevitable.

Nigel Green at financial services firm deVere Group is confident that cryptocurrencies will replace traditional money and, although that moment is still some way off, he says PayPal’s announcement is “yet another example that exposes cryptocurrency deniers as being on the wrong side of history”.

“This is a major step forward towards the mass adoption of digital currencies,” he says. “More and more payment companies will naturally follow their lead.”","('https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/27230900/PRI_196572705.jpg',)",none
2021-08-30,Euronews,Bitcoin ban: These are the countries where crypto is restricted or illegal,https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/30/bitcoin-ban-these-are-the-countries-where-crypto-is-restricted-or-illegal2,"Bitcoin has been controversial since its beginning in 2009, as have the subsequent cryptocurrencies that followed in its wake.

While widely criticised for its volatility, its use in nefarious transactions and for the exorbitant use of electricity to mine it, Bitcoin is being seen by some, particularly in the developing world, as a safe harbour during economic storms.

But as more people turn to cryptos as either an investment or a lifeline, these issues have manifested in an array of restrictions on their usage.

The legal status of Bitcoin and other altcoins (alternative coins to Bitcoin) varies substantially from country to country, while in some, the relationship remains to be properly defined or is constantly changing.

Whereas the majority of countries don’t make using Bitcoin itself illegal, its status as a means of payment or as a commodity varies with differing regulatory implications.

Some countries have placed limitations on the way Bitcoin can be used, with banks banning its customers from making cryptocurrency transactions. Other countries have banned the use of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies outright with heavy penalties in place for anyone making crypto transactions.

These are the countries that have a particularly fraught relationship with Bitcoin and other altcoins.

Algeria

Algeria currently prohibits the use of cryptocurrency following the passing of a financial law in 2018 that made it illegal to buy, sell, use or hold virtual currencies.

Bolivia

There is a complete ban in place on the usage of Bitcoin in Bolivia since 2014. The Bolivian Central Bank issued a resolution banning it and any other currency not regulated by a country or economic zone.

China

China has cracked down on cryptocurrencies with increasing intensity throughout 2021. Chinese officials have repeatedly issued warnings to its people to stay clear of the digital asset market and have clamped down hard on mining in the country as well as currency exchanges in China and overseas.

On August 27, Yin Youping, the Deputy Director of the Financial Consumer Rights Protection Bureau of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), referred to cryptos as speculative assets and warned people to “protect their pockets”.

Efforts to undermine Bitcoin - a decentralised currency outside the control of governments and institutions - are largely seen as an attempt by the Chinese authorities to float their own e-currency.

The PBoC is looking to be one of the first major central banks in the world to launch its own digital currency, and in doing so would be able to more closely monitor the transactions of its people.

Colombia

In Colombia, financial institutions are not allowed to facilitate Bitcoin transactions. The Superintendencia Financiera warned financial institutions in 2014 that they may not ""protect, invest, broker, or manage virtual money operations”.

Egypt

Egypt’s Dar al-Ifta, the country’s primary Islamic advisory body, issued a religious decree in 2018, classifying Bitcoin transactions as “haram,” something prohibited under Islamic law. While not binding, Egypt’s banking laws were tightened in September 2020 to prevent trading or promoting cryptos without a Central Bank licence.

Indonesia

Bank Indonesia, the country's central bank, issued new regulations banning the use of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, as a means of payment from 1 January 2018.

Iran

Bitcoin has a complex relationship with the Iranian regime. In order to evade the worst impact of crippling economic sanctions, Iran has instead turned to the lucrative practice of Bitcoin mining in order to finance imports.

While the Central Bank prohibits the trading of cryptocurrencies mined overseas, it has encouraged Bitcoin mining in the country with incentives.

Around 4.5 per cent of the world’s Bitcoin mining takes place in Iran, which, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, could account for revenues of over $1 billion (€843 million).

In order for the crypto industry to flourish, Iran has offered licenced miners cheap energy but requires all mined cryptos to be sold to the Central Bank.

However, unlicensed mining drains more than 2GW from the national grid every day, causing power shortages.

To this end, Iranian authorities issued a four-month ban on Bitcoin mining until September 22.

Nepal

The Nepal Rastra Bank declared Bitcoin illegal as of August 2017.

North Macedonia

North Macedonia is the only European country so far to have an official ban on cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, in place.

Russia

While cryptocurrency isn’t outlawed in Russia, there is an ongoing conflict being waged against its use.

Russia passed its first laws to regulate cryptos in July 2020, which for the first time designated cryptocurrency as property liable to taxation.

The law, which came into force in January this year, also bans Russian civil servants from owning any crypto assets.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly linked cryptocurrency with criminal activity, calling for closer attention to cross-border crypto transactions in particular.

In July, the prosecutor general announced new proposed legislation which would allow police to confiscate cryptos deemed to be illegally obtained citing its use in bribery.

Turkey

Many in Turkey turned to cryptocurrency as the Turkish lira plummeted in value. With some of the highest levels of use anywhere in the world, the arrival of regulations was swift this year as inflation peaked in April.

On 16 April 2021, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey issued a regulation banning the use of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, directly or indirectly, to pay for goods and services. The following day, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan went further and issued a decree that crypto exchanges to a list of firms subject to anti-money laundering and terrorism financing rules.

Vietnam

The State Bank of Vietnam has declared that the issuance, supply, and use of Bitcoin and other cryptos are illegal as a means of payment and are subject to punishment of fines ranging from 150 million VND (€5,600) to 200 million VND (€7,445).

However, the government doesn't ban Bitcoin trading or holding them as assets.","('https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/01/62/64/1000x563_cmsv2_855a8ddc-6bb7-5a3b-82f1-ca707e2a07ff-6016264.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrencies, despite being considered among the market's hot commodities, have drawn sharp criticism from billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson who described it as a ""bubble"" that would prove to be ""worthless"".

Paulson, while speaking at an episode of 'Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein' aired on August 30, said there is no intrinsic value attached with cryptocurrencies except for a ""limited amount"".

The segment is ""too volatile"", he said, pointing out that Bitcoin went from US$5,000 to US$45,000 within a short period.

""Cryptocurrencies, regardless of where they’re trading today, will eventually prove to be worthless. Once the exuberance wears off, or liquidity dries up, they will go to zero. I wouldn’t recommend anyone invest in cryptocurrencies,"" said Paulson, who earned a mark for betting against the US housing market more than a decade ago.

""I would say that cryptocurrencies are a bubble. I would describe them as a limited supply of nothing,"" he further said, adding that the prices would go up only to the extent where the demand is more than the limited supply.

Notably, cryptocurrencies, which are yet to be considered legal tender in any major economy, have garnered massive interest over the past couple of years. In the recent period, the buzz over cryptos was fuelled by Elon Musk, the founder of electric vehicle maker Tesla.

Musk's company had boosted Bitcoin's value by announcing in March that it would accept payment in form of the cryptocurrency. However, Tesla ended up disappointing the crypto enthusiasts by reversing its decision in May.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/08/John-Paulson-770x433.jpg',)",none

The Fed chief indicated a gradual easing of support, and markets will be closely watching some big data due this week that could weigh into how fast or slow the central bank proceeds. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing report is due at midweek, followed by nonfarm payrolls on Friday.

Energy is in the spotlight, as well, for Monday, in the wake of one of the biggest hurricanes to ever hit the U.S. mainland.

On to our call of the day, from a billionaire investor who believes investors shouldn’t waste money or time on one increasingly popular asset class that he views as a “bubble.”

“Cryptocurrencies, regardless of where they’re trading today, will eventually prove to be worthless. Once the exuberance wears off, or liquidity dries up, they will go to zero. I wouldn’t recommend anyone invest in cryptocurrencies,” John Paulson, president and portfolio manager of U.S. investment firm Paulson & Co., told Bloomberg Wealth in an interview that published on Monday.

Paulson said it wasn’t even worth shorting bitcoin given its extreme volatility, and instead suggested investors sock money into bullion, due to “a very limited amount of investible gold.” Paulson sees investors pulling money out of fixed income and cash as inflation rises, then heading toward the only logical destination — that is, gold.

For those not familiar with the Paulson name, the former hedge-fund manager made a killing betting against the U.S. housing market before it collapsed.

Bitcoin pushed to $50,000 early last week but then struggled to keep that level, even as Powell comments on Friday weighed on the dollar and gave cryptocurrencies a lift. Bitcoin was trading around $47,000 early Monday.

Paulson had another piece of advice for those who just happen to have $100,000 laying around: Use it to buy your own home. Read the full interview here.

Ida rips across the south

The digging out from one of the worst storms to ever hit the U.S. is set to begin. Hurricane Ida cut power to New Orleans, tearing off rooftops and sent the Mississippi River’s flow in the opposite direction. One death has been reported so far, and rescuers have begun to look for those stranded.

Affirm Holdings shares AFRM, +34.37% are soaring after the buy-now-pay-later fintech group announced late Friday that it has partnered with Amazon AMZN, -0.43% . Elsewhere, Baxter International BAX, -0.98% is reportedly in advanced talks to buy medical-equipment maker Hill-Rom Holdings HRC, -0.44% for around $10 billion.

A Tesla TSLA, -2.46% using its autopilot feature crashed into a Florida Highway Patrol cruiser Saturday, narrowly missing the driver. The U.S. government opened a formal investigation into the electric-car maker’s autonomous-navigation system earlier this month.

The European Union may announce on Monday a recommendation to halt nonessential travel from the U.S., where the COVID-19 infection rate is now above that of the common-currency region. That’s as hospitalizations have been hovering above 100,000 and some southern states are running out of oxygen for patients.

Carnival CCL, -2.28% , meanwhile, is facing a lawsuit that claims the cruise ship failed to protect those taking its cruises from the coronavirus causing COVID-19.

The markets

Stock futures ES00, +0.52% YM00, +0.53% NQ00, +0.48% are barely budging, in line with European equities SXXP, +0.67% . Oil prices CL00, +0.47% CLV21, +0.47% are slipping after rallying ahead of Hurricane Ida, while gasoline prices RBU21 are falling. The storm has knocked out 95% of energy production in the Gulf of Mexico.

At the moment, trends in the broader crypto market remain mixed as trading momentum remains weak.

Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, fell marginally today after rebounding during the weekend. Bitcoin was trading at $47,958, up over 1.17 per cent from its price 24 hours ago at 1:35 pm.

The market capitalisation of the cryptocurrency remains above $900 billion. However, the trading volume has remained weak at $616 million. At the same time, volatility remains high.

Ether, which is the second-most popular cryptocurrency, has also fallen over the past 24 hours. It is trading at $3,179 or nearly per cent lower than its price a day ago.

The market capitalisation of Ether has also fallen to $372.59 billion. Like Bitcoin, the trading volumes for Ether have remained low in the past 24 hours.

Popular altcoins such as XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Stellar, Polkadot, Uniswap, Chainlink, Polygon and Litecoin also remained weaker than their valuation 24 hours ago.

Lower trading activity seems to be the main reason why the cryptocurrency market slightly lost momentum today. However, the momentum may rise today due to some positive developments including Cuba’s intention to regulate cryptocurrency use.

Cuba said it would authorise and regulate the use of cryptocurrency for “reasons of socioeconomic interest”.

Meanwhile, the first cryptocurrency ATM has been opened in Honduras as Bitcoin backers sought to spur demand for virtual assets after neighbouring El Salvador became the first country to establish Bitcoin as legal tender.

Here are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:

The Bloomberg report pointed out that Paulson is a big believer—and buyer-- of gold despite digital assets outperforming the metal.

Digital currencies, like Bitcoin, have been left largely unregulated by major governments up to this point.

The Wall Street Journal reported in July that Paulson announced that he will convert his hedge fund into a private investment firm after experiencing some declines. The Bloomberg report called his results after the famous short ""mixed.""

NEW DELHI: Cuba’s Central Bank has officially recognised cryptocurrencies that are operating within their politico-economic jurisdiction. The Cuba Standard report on the subject quoted resolution number 215 published in the country’s Gaceta oficial (official Gazette).Resolution 215 has set norms on how the central bank will regulate cyber currencies. Cuban crypto investors are now happy, as regulation of cryptocurrency also means that they are now officially accepted as virtual assets.The resolution also states that Banco Central de Cuba (BCC) -- Cuba’s central bank -- will license commercial providers in due course.Cuba Standard quotes Eduardo Sanchez, a Blockchain expert, as saying: “It will be important for the government to regulate and maintain sovereignty over the financial system. The Cuban context shares the same risk with any other crypto markets in the world — the volatility, security, capital flight, financing for criminal activities.”This announcement by BCC has opened another route which was closed for Cuba after the US government had shut down most legal channels for US-Cuba remittances in late 2019.Cuba has jumped on to the crypto bandwagon only after Havana University and BCC had set up a study group in 2019 that examined if the country could introduce its own cryptocurrency, just like Venezuela.In a disclaimer, the resolution clarifies that “the individual must assume the risks and responsibilities of operating with virtual assets and service providers that function at the margins of the banking and financial system, even if virtual-asset transactions between said persons are not prohibited.”Cuban state banks will have to take prior approval from the BCC for using cryptocurrencies. Many young Cubans have already started dealing with cryptocurrencies following a boom in mobile data usage and improvements in the telecom infrastructure in the country. They are known to have used cryptocurrencies even to get paid through jobs.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85760057,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-301994,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

2021-08-30,Global News,Cryptocurrency could become an Edmonton election issue - Edmonton,https://globalnews.ca/news/8149690/edmonton-election-cryptocurrency/,"Send this page to someone via email

From potholes to taxes, there are issues Edmontonians expect to be raised every municipal election.

As the 2021 municipal race gets closer, cryptocurrency is becoming a talking point in at least one ward.

Lana Palmer is running for a council seat in Ward Dene.

As she knocks on doors, she’s promising voters to make Edmonton a cryptocurrency-friendly city.

“I think most people are interested in that discussion,” Palmer told Global News.

“They want to know more about it, especially if it doesn’t cost us anything.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""They want to know more about it, especially if it doesn't cost us anything.""

Palmer’s first step would see the city declare itself as a municipality that embraces the high-tech currency.

Adam O’Brien believes that would go a long way in boosting the industry in Edmonton.

O’Brien is the founder and CEO of Bitcoin Well. The Edmonton-based company is the world’s first publicly traded Bitcoin ATM machine.

He thinks having a city publicly support the industry would break down some of the stigmas around it.

“We call them FUD in the industry. Fear, uncertainty and doubt. I think there’s a lot of FUD around Bitcoin,” O’Brien said.

Edmonton would not be the first in Canada to do so.

In 2019, Innisfil in Ontario became the first municipality in the country to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment for property taxes.

O’Brien explained that could save the city the processing and transaction fees it currently pays every time a citizen submits a credit card payment online.

He believes Edmonton could benefit by using Bitcoin to pay for projects.

“The provinces and the federal governments don’t quite get hit with inflation as hard because they’re the ones who print money. They can go into a surplus if they want, but local communities can’t,” he said.

El Salvador has gone further, voting to make Bitcoin a legal tender. Similar to bilingualism, stores and businesses will have to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.

In April, governor of the Bank of Canada Tiff Macklem told reporters the pandemic has accelerated the digital economy and “the case for a digital currency becomes more compelling.”

Palmer agrees. She said cryptocurrency is already quickly gaining popularity around the world and Edmonton should jump in as soon as possible.

“I think it is volatile, but at the same time, we don’t need to make any radical investments. We don’t need to go all in,” she said.

Edmonton does have interest if Bitcoin Well is any indication.

The company, which started in 2014, is about to go through a major expansion, going from an estimated 60 employees to about 200.

It has 160 Bitcoin ATMs across the country and is getting into the United Kingdom.

Whether that sort of success will translate to the election will be determined when Edmontonians go to the polls on Oct. 18.","('https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1042134152-e1621488171450.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1',)",none
2021-08-30,The Guardian,Scepticism grows in El Salvador over pioneering Bitcoin gamble,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/30/scepticism-grows-in-el-salvador-over-pioneering-bitcoin-gamble,"Litha María de Los Angeles slaps two cheese-filled pupusas – the El Salvadoran cornmeal flatbread – on the griddle. With a camera click on the QR code, she receives her payment: four hundred-thousandths of a Bitcoin. Then, as the rain pelts the corrugated iron roof and a gust of wind lifts the blue plastic table cloths, the power cuts out.

A tumultuous few weeks awaits El Salvador as it prepares to become the first country to adopt Bitcoin, the world’s most popular decentralised digital currency, as legal tender on 7 September. With that deadline looming, a host of challenges – technological, financial and criminal – threaten to sink the plan of the president, Nayib Bukele, to ride the Central American economy out of its current choppy waters on the back of a cryptocurrency wave.

El Zonte, a surf town with about 3,000 residents and a black sand, pebble-strewn beach, is an unlikely location for a global financial revolution. But since 2018 the town’s Bitcoin Beach project has been a petri dish for cryptocurrency adoption. Backed by Californian donors, the project gave $50 (£36) in Bitcoin to each local family, encouraged the cryptocurrency’s adoption by local vendors, and paid dozens of social projects with it, from lifeguarding to rubbish collecting.

“Now you can buy groceries, pupusas, or pay for your internet with Bitcoin,” says José Roman Martínez, 30, one of the founders of Bitcoin Beach. “For many people, this is the first time they’ve received a digital payment.”

Interest in the project from crypto-savvy tourists has given a new lease of life to El Zonte and led to a real-estate boom in the town, according to Martínez. “When I was a kid, the only thing Salvadorans wanted to do was to cross the border and head to the US. Now the kids here are dreaming of better things.”

Can a circular-economy experiment backed by a handful of foreign crypto-evangelists replicate itself at the national level? Salvadorans have had no say in the matter so far, but they are about to find out.

Bukele announced his plan to elevate Bitcoin to legal tender in June (a month before his 40th birthday) with his customary millennial elan: via video link to a Miami cryptocurrency conference. Since then, like Elon Musk with a presidential mandate, he has prolifically pumped out Bitcoin memes and promises on his Twitter account.

Just five days after the announcement, lawmakers passed the bill by a large majority. A national digital wallet called Chivo – local slang for “cool” – is in development with $30 worth of Bitcoin uploaded to each one as an initial balance. Transactions in Bitcoin will be exempt from capital gains tax, and foreigners investing three Bitcoins in the country (about $120,000) will be granted residency.

In August a research note by Bank of America enthused about the new law’s ability to reduce the cost of cross-border transactions (remittances account for 20% of El Salvador’s GDP), increase digital penetration in a country where 70% of people still do not use banks, and attract foreign investment as a first mover in cryptocurrency adoption.

Since then, however, the verdict from international financial organisations – and El Salvadorans themselves – has turned decidedly pessimistic.

“The law was adopted extremely quickly, without a technical study or a public debate,” says Ricardo Castaneda, a local economist. “I don’t think the president has fully understood the implications of the law, its potential to cause serious macroeconomic problems and convert the country into a haven for money laundering.”

The regulatory framework for adoption has yet to be published and there are rumours of delays to the Chivo app. Bankers in the capital say they have received calls from anxious clients threatening to withdraw their deposits rather than risk exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency markets.

This is Yolo investing elevated to the national level Daniel Munevar, Colombian economist

The ratings agency Moody’s downgraded El Salvadoran debt over fears of “weakened governance” evidenced by the new law, and the IMF – with which the government is negotiating a $1bn loan – published a blogpost highlighting the risks of adopting crypto as national currency.

“The shift from euphoria to scepticism has been very fast,” says Castaneda.

The potential benefits identified by the Bank of America are probably overstated. A paper by Johns Hopkins University says the cost of remittances via Bitcoin will be higher than traditional methods, and a July survey found that nearly two-thirds of El Salvadorans would not be open to accepting payment in Bitcoin.

Eric Grill, CEO of Chainbytes, which produces Bitcoin ATMs, told the Guardian that his plan to relocate manufacturing to El Salvador had faced serious challenges in sourcing parts. Local geothermal energy experts say Bukele’s plan to power energy-intensive Bitcoin mining activities from the country’s volcanoes are wildly optimistic.

The government insists that El Salvadorans will be free to exchange their Bitcoin for US dollars, which the country adopted as national currency in 2001, and has proposed a $150m fund to ensure convertibility. Given popular scepticism, however, critics say this is unlikely to be sufficient. It would also open the door for illegal actors to convert Bitcoin – which rose to prominence on Silk Road, an online black market, and prides itself on the anonymity of transactions – to dollars via a national bank and thereby launder their gains.

Perhaps the biggest concern, however, is that it exposes a population with little financial education – for the most part, without an economic safety net – to the fate of the highly volatile cryptocurrency markets.

“The Bitcoin law essentially gambles with two public purses, that of the El Salvador government and of the IMF,” says Daniel Munevar, a Colombian economist focused on debt justice. “It’s one thing for an American to bet his stimulus cheque on cryptocurrency in the hope of big returns, but this is Yolo [you only live once] investing elevated to the national level.”

In El Zonte, locals are developing their own common-sense investment strategies. Dominga Peña sells minutas – cups of shaved ice flavoured with fruit syrups – on the beach.

She says one in 10 customers pay with Bitcoin and she keeps most of that as an emergency spending fund for small purchases. “The people from Bitcoin Beach explained the benefits and disadvantages [of receiving crypto-payments],” she said. “It changed my mentality to investing, but I wouldn’t keep too much money in Bitcoin. The price has gone up and down a lot recently.”","('https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9e7263ab02a68b93cac09c1d7e02bd82adecbd0/0_40_6006_3603/master/6006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e01a3b749919971be7b68e169b1d9f53',)",none

2021-08-30,NDTV Gadgets 360,Should You Invest in Cryptocurrency?,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/opinion/should-you-invest-in-cryptocurrency-2520661,"Everybody wants to invest in crypto. Including my house help's 14-year old son. True story. I am always asked how to invest in crypto. But I think the most important question people should ask me is, ""Should I invest in crypto?"". Crypto is a new, small, highly immature, and extremely volatile market.

Don't invest in cryptocurrency because you think it's ""cool"". A fixed deposit with a boring bank might not sound cool but may be a better investment for many people. Let's start with six questions that you must answer honestly:

Can you afford to lose your entire crypto investment? Are you tech-savvy and ready to learn how to keep your crypto safe? Are you ready to spend a good amount of time every single day researching cryptos and monitoring your portfolio? Can you wrap your head around the fact that crypto prices depend more on tweets by (evil?) billionaires like Elon Musk and less on logic and economics? Are you ready to understand the meaning of stuff like this? — ""Sharpe Ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility. Volatility measures the price fluctuations of a cryptocurrency and is usually calculated using variance and standard deviation."" Are you ready to spend time looking at graphs like this?

Photo Credit: Rohas Nagpal

If you can honestly answer ""yes"" to all these questions, then let's talk about some recent crypto disasters:

A cryptocurrency called Internet Computer (ICP) started off in the top 10 cryptos of the world. And then crashed more than 90% in a month — from a price of $737.20 to $20.08.

A cryptocurrency called TITAN went from $52.46 to $0.00000003 in 10 days! One of its most famous investors was the non-evil billionaire Mark Cuban. Yes, even super-smart billionaires make bad crypto mistakes.

A cryptocurrency called SafeDollar suddenly went to 0. And this was a stablecoin — its price was supposed to be ""stable""!

If you are still sure that you want to invest in crypto, then let's get started. Over the next few weeks I will talk about:

How to trade and hold crypto

How to pick good cryptos

How to keep your crypto safe

Crypto metrics that every investor must know

Crypto indexes and stacks

How to profit from crypto staking and lending

And I have some homework for you - figure out which of the 3 types of crypto investors you are. For this, read about 3 cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), and decide which one you like the best.

The popularity and growth of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin , Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether, Dogecoin have compelled investors and sceptics to take a second look. Around 15 million Indians are said to have invested in private crypto assets. Young investors like Priya are excited about the prospects of strong returns. She is planning to open a crypto trading account. However, she would like to understand each and every aspect of the crypto market before she starts investing in earnest.A cryptocurrency (or crypto) is a non-physical, digital and decentralized currency that is issued by private systems and remains out of the purview of the government. It is a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Priya will need to store her cryptocurrency in a digital wallet . There were over 4,000 different cryptocurrencies in circulation worldwide, including the market giants Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Much of the interest in these unregulated currencies is to trade for profit, with investors/speculators at times driving prices skyward.Cryptocurrencies work using blockchain technology, a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security. Transactions cannot be altered or deleted and are hard for hackers to tamper with. In addition, transactions require a two-factor authentication process. The investor can add more and more digital transactions and the blockchain gets updated automatically.In order to trade in cryptocurrencies, Priya must open a crypto trading account on a cryptocurrency exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange, such as Coinbase , helps in the trading of cryptocurrencies in various currencies and also provides wallet services. It acts as a broker and facilitates transactions between the buyers and sellers, while their main sources of revenue are transaction fees and commissions. Once the account is opened and KYC formalities are completed, Priya can deposit money in the cryptocurrency exchange via card transactions or direct bank transfers to purchase cryptocurrencies, against a fee.While crypto trading is the current rage and may even yield potentially high returns, Priya must understand that cryptocurrency is an incredibly speculative and a volatile buy. The market is still in its infancy. Investing in something that’s new comes with challenges, so she must be prepared for ups and downs, including some dramatic swings. If her investment portfolio or risk appetite can’t handle that, cryptocurrency might not be a wise choice for her.(Content on this page is courtesy Centre for Investment Education and Learning (CIEL).

In response to the speech, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell, the S&P 500 index rose to a new all-time high, and Bitcoin (BTC) surged about $1,500 in under an hour. This showed that market participants viewed the speech as “dovish.”

Bitcoin’s uncertainty near the $50,000 mark has analysts divided about its short-term directional move. Analyst Ryan Clark believes the current consolidation in Bitcoin is similar to the one seen below $24,000 before the breakout in December 2020, but TraderXO believes that BTC may correct to the $39,000 to $42,000 zone in September.

Will Bitcoin’s consolidation below $50,000 attract buying in altcoins? Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the next few days.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin bounced off the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), calculated at $46,823, on Aug. 27, but the bulls have not been able to push the price above the overhead resistance zone at $50,000 to $50,500. This suggests that bears have not thrown in the towel yet.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price turns down from the current level and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the short-term traders are booking profits. That may pull the price down to $43,927 and then to $42,451.

If the price rebounds off this support, the BTC/USDT pair may remain range-bound between $42,451 and $50,500 for a few more days.

Alternatively, if the price turns up from the current level or bounces off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the overhead zone. If they manage to do that, the pair may start its journey toward $60,000.

The moving averages on the four-hour chart have flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is close to the midpoint, indicating a range-bound action in the near term. The price may remain stuck between $46,200 and $49,500 for some time.

If bulls drive the price above $49,500, the pair may challenge the $50,500 resistance. A breakout and close above this level could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. On the contrary, if bears sink the price below $46,200, the pair may drop to $44,000.

ADA/USDT

Cardano (ADA) is currently consolidating between $2.97 and $2.47. The price had dropped to the breakout level at $2.47 on Aug. 26, but the sharp rebound off it on Aug. 27 shows that bulls have flipped the level into support.

A consolidation near the all-time high is a positive sign as it shows that traders continue to buy on dips. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If buyers drive and sustain the price above the psychological barrier at $3, the ADA/USDT pair could resume its uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $3.50.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the $2.97-to-$3 resistance zone, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. A break and close below $2.47 will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened.

The RSI on the four-hour chart has formed a negative divergence, indicating that the upward momentum may be slowing down. If bears pull and sustain the price below the 50-day simple moving average, the pair may drop to $2.47.

A strong bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $2.47 and $2.97 for some time. The bears will have to sink the price below the $2.47-to-$2.31 support zone to gain the upper hand. Alternatively, the uptrend may resume if bulls drive and sustain the price above $2.97.

LUNA/USDT

Terra protocol’s LUNA token is in a strong uptrend. After a few days of consolidation, the price rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($26.42) on Aug. 27, indicating that the sentiment remains positive.

LUNA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that bulls have the upper hand. The first target objective on the upside is a move to $43 and, if that level is crossed, the LUNA/USDT pair may rally to $50.

However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests that bears are defending the overhead resistance aggressively. If bears pull the price below $32, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA.

This is an important level for the bulls to defend. A strong bounce off it will suggest that the uptrend remains intact, but a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate that the bullish momentum has weakened.

The four-hour chart shows a broadening triangle formation, which indicates an increase in volatility. The buyers had pushed the price above the triangle but they could not sustain the breakout, suggesting aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels.

If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again make one more attempt to clear the overhead hurdle. If bulls sustain the price above the triangle, it may signal the resumption of the up-move. The pattern target of this setup is $46.95.

Alternatively, if the price breaks below the moving averages, the pair could drop to the support line of the triangle. A break and close below this support will signal that bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair may then drop to the $22.40-to-$20.81 support zone.

VET/USDT

After the sharp recovery from its recent lows at $0.05 on July 21, VeChain (VET) has formed a pennant. This setup will complete after the price breaks above or below the formation.

VET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.11) has flattened out and the RSI has dropped close to the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. A breakout and close above the resistance line of the pennant will suggest the resumption of the up-move.

The first target objective on the upside is a move to $0.16 and, if this level is crossed, the VET/USDT pair may rally to $0.19.

Conversely, if the price breaks below the support line of the pennant, the bullish view will be negated. The pair could then decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.09).

The four-hour chart shows the price is getting squeezed inside the triangle. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

The rebound off the support line is facing stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA. If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to sink the pair below the support line. If they succeed, the pair may drop to $0.082.

On the other hand, if bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair could challenge the resistance line. A breakout and close above this resistance could signal the resumption of the up-move.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) completed a rounding-bottom pattern when the price broke and closed above the overhead resistance at $4.47. This suggests the start of a new uptrend that has a pattern target at $6.85.

XTZ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Usually, after the price breaks out of a setup, it retests the breakout level. In this case, the XTZ/USDT pair could drop to $4.47. If bulls flip this level into support, it will suggest the start of a new uptrend. The rising 20-day EMA ($4.25) and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate advantage to buyers.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could trap several aggressive bulls and result in a decline to the 50-day SMA ($3.31).

The four-hour chart shows that the pair picked up momentum after it rose above the $4.47 resistance. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand.

The pair could rally to the overhead resistance zone at $6.31 to $6.50, where bears may mount a stiff resistance. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. That could open the doors for a decline to the breakout level at $4.47.

The native asset of the Cardano blockchain, ADA, hit a new high on Monday as investors pinned their hopes on an impending smart contracts feature that is expected to accelerate the cryptocurrency's adoption.

Cosmos (ATOM)

The widely anticipated distribution of the London hard fork on the Ethereum (ETH) network has done little to solve the network's high transaction fees and delayed confirmations, therefore momentum for the top layer-one protocols has been on the rise throughout August.

Ethereum NFT CryptoPunks

According to NFT aggregation site, CryptoPunks, a 10,000-strong collection of Ethereum-based NFTs, has already topped $1 billion in sales.

NFT enthusiasts and crypto aficionados were euphoric this week thanks to a flurry of announcements by behemoths like Visa and Facebook.Visa’s entry into metaverse with the purchase of CryptoPunk was soon followed by Facebook’s decision to incorporate NFT features in the Novi wallet. Novi with NFT capabilities will give a big boost to Facebook’s metaverse (a connected virtual universe) goals.NFTs have become a cynosure of all eyes. Artists, singers and even sportspersons are moving into this space. Football legend Messi has jumped on to the NFT bandwagon by launching NFT crypto art collection – ‘Messiverse’.Let’s go by the numbers. OpenSea, a leading NFT marketplace, has reported $1 billion in payment volume for August. According to DappRadar, a platform which tracks cross-platform sales, trading volumes in the first half of this year stood slightly less than $2.5 billion. NFTs are gaining traction. With the payment giants and big techs moving into this space, new opportunities and revenue streams can be unlocked in the realm of the metaverse.NFTs are unique digital-native tokens ,which are used to represent ownership of a digital goods like image, video, text or song. The ownership and trading of these digital goods can be tracked on public blockchains. Blockchain brings in the necessary provenance and authenticity. Unlike popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , non-fungible tokens are unique and cannot be interchanged.The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a loss of $18 billion of global sports revenue. Sports businesses, therefore, are focusing on new technologies to diversify revenue. Leagues and teams are utilising NFTs to connect with fans and drive engagement. Sporting clubs are monetising their unique assets and generating new revenue streams by moving into the crypto-based online games. This has helped the NFT space to evolve. The sports industry should position itself for long-term opportunities to ensure fan loyalty by offering them decision-making rights in teams and maximize revenue through potential growth synergies.The ‘Creator Earnings, Benchmark Report 2021”, published by influencermarketing.com, revealed that around 43% of all creators make $50,000 a year. In 2020, the creator economy –the industry of influencers, bloggers, videographers and anyone on social media monetising their online fanbases — clocked $800 million yearly growth. The size of the entire creator economy is estimated to be $104 billion. It is gradually giving traditional entertainment media a run for money.According to Statista, mobile viewership surpassed 50% of all global traffic in Q3 of 2020, reaching 54% by Q1 of 2021. With the emergence of new token-agnostic protocols, users can deposit any ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) tokens into any NFT. Interest-bearing NFTs, also known as DeFi NFTs, can unlock new revenue streams for content creators.NFTs will play a pivotal role in growing the passion economy and fostering a win-win situation for both curators and collectors . NFTs are known for their composability and can be clubbed with event tickets. The traceability and provenance of such tickets can bring in royalties in the event of secondary sales. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has launched an NFT marketplace for copyright trading. The marketplace will permit trademark or patent holders to trade NFTs representing intellectual property rights. As the NFT ecosystem grows, new use cases will come to the fore, and innovations in crypto and NFT will continue to shape the future of commerce.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85733424,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-15769,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-30,The Economic Times,What happens to the cryptocurrency you buy if India decides to ban it,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/what-happens-to-the-cryptocurrency-you-buy-if-india-decides-to-ban-it/articleshow/85732191.cms,"Well, it is not the first time that the Indian government has pondered over banning cryptocurrencies. Initially, in 2013, when bitcoin was launched, the first few years went in hush-hush. The technology was new. This was something that was a store of value with no central authority.Not only the government but also, enthusiastic investors were speculating how bitcoin will turn out to be. When after the end of 2016, this revolutionary financial asset made noise, the Indian government came to action.Any government of the world is about authority, power and regulation. And bitcoin, or rather say, cryptocurrency , took that power from the government. There was no bank, no RBI or no scrutiny around your money. You held an asset and you did your investment, you used the money gained and you made sure your investment strategy works for you. There was no advisory, no policymakers, no brainwashing whatsoever. The bitcoin investment grew so much in 2017, that the Indian government had to come into action.When wheels came, bicycles were invented. We all thought this is going to stay. Then came the motors and we thought the motor vehicles were going to stay. Then came the Wright brothers, who told us that we also could fly. But when the finite supply of automobile fuel would be exhausted, none of these would matter.On the same lines, we thought writing letters is the best way to reach farther places. Then boom. The 2000s came and the internet was all over. The communication could be done in milliseconds.So now let us talk about what we cannot do when there is a ban. When we say the ban, we mean that the transactions between the bank and your crypto exchanges will be stopped. This means that you will not be able to convert your local currency into buying any kind of cryptocurrency. This also means that you will not be able to liquidate your HODLed cryptos and get them encashed. This means, your HODLed cryptocurrency will be on *HODL* for some time more until the ban is uplifted.But what if you send your cryptos to someone who is not an Indian resident and belongs to a country where crypto is legal. Well, in that case, you can always send your acquired crypto, and get the equivalent INR in your bank. However, this procedure of exit would come at a cost. The foreign exchange cost and penalties would cost you more than the actual exchange fees, had there been no ban in your own country.But, you still need to identify the catch here. By the above method, we see that the transactions that involve crypto are still possible. No government can ever tame the internet. The government tried to ban PUBG. The gaming community in India identified VPNs that would still make PUBG accessible to them. The government tried banning porn, but anything that is accessible to everyone, or is made available on the cloud, can never be fully tamed. The same goes with the decentralised and open source-based cryptocurrencies as well. Unocoin is one such platform that lets its user buy, sell and trade 40+ cryptocurrencies. The transactional fees are very nominal as compared to the features that it provides. Unocoin has always respected and abided by the laws set by the government of India and RBI. But it also makes sure it creates a space where the crypto exchanges are smooth. Hence, Unocoin collaborated with Airtm for a cross-platform transaction. With this Unocoin - Airtm collab, any Unocoin user can buy any crypto from either platform in exchange for his/her local fiat currency and via the pairing coin USTether ( USDT ), can convert his/her acquired cryptos into another crypto/fiat currency from the other platform.It is like entering a bridge, walking on the bridge and reaching the other side of the river. With the USDT acting as a pairing coin or the bridge, the walk from one end to the other and back to the first end is possible.While there are speculations on the cryptocurrency, the virtual currency enthusiasts know for sure, that these are only the ups and downs that come in their investment plan. India would eventually be a country where there will be no inhibitions over cryptocurrencies, sooner or later.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85732188,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56088,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrency Symbol Last Traded Price( Aug 29) Market Cap Ethereum ETH $3,180.98 $373,546,693,409 Chainlink LINK $25.50 $11,438,608,047 Uniswap UNI $26.28 $16,103,393,192 Polkadot DOT $25.54 $25,260,127,975 Aave AAVE $358.44 $4,712,444,011

Ethereum

Ethereum is a smart contracts platform that hosts the majority of today's significant decentralized apps (DApps). Although Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, Ethereum is the blockchain that collects and maintains data as well as housing a variety of apps.

So, why do we predict Ethereum to skyrocket this year? Let's see what happens. Its London Hard Fork update arrived this month, complete with its five EIPs. The update, which promised decreased transaction costs and a deflationary mechanism, was met with a tremendous bull run by ETH. Not only that, but the excitement surrounding Ethereum 2.0 is also driving up the price. Who knows how much ETH will rise once the transfer is complete.

Chainlink (LINK)

Chainlink is an Ethereum-based decentralized blockchain oracle network. The network is designed to make it easier to move tamper-proof data from off-chain sources to smart contracts on the blockchain.

The LINK token from Chainlink is an ERC677 token, which is an extension of the ERC20 standard. Tokens serve as data payloads, delivering essential data from off-chain sources to smart contracts, which subsequently operate in accordance with the token's contents. [5] [a better source is required] The trade value created from these tokens, according to Chainlink, is used to pay node operators for accessing data from smart contracts, as well as deposits made by node operators as requested by contract designers. Because the ERC677 token keeps all of the functionality of an ERC20 token, it may be stored in any ERC20 wallet.

Uniswap (UNI)

The Uniswap decentralized cryptocurrency exchange's governance token is Uniswap. To grasp how it works and whether the token is worthwhile to purchase, we must first comprehend decentralized exchanges, or DEXs.

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on Ethereum that primarily trades cryptocurrencies and other tokens. DEXs are the next big thing in cryptocurrency trading, especially in light of the recent problems surrounding centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance. Decentralized solutions are becoming increasingly popular among users as a method to bypass the middleman and take control of their own affairs.

Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot, a relative newcomer to the crypto industry, has already astonished crypto traders all around the world. Polkadot launched in August 2020 and quickly rose to the top 5 cryptocurrencies, where it has remained since.

Polkadot's primary goal is to enable cross-chain transfers. It allows a range of assets, not just crypto, to be shared between multiple blockchains in this way. As certain as we are that cryptocurrencies will be a part of the future, we are equally certain that multi-chain will be the next big thing in blockchain technology.

Aave (AAVE)

Aave is a decentralized financial system that enables people to lend and borrow digital assets.

Decentralized lending, as you might expect, has a higher interest rate than centralized lending. It also provides more privacy and security. Depositing digital assets into properly designed liquidity pools allows lenders to earn interest. Borrowers can then use this liquidity to take out flash loans using their bitcoin as collateral.

AAVE is the network's governance token and offers its holders discounted platform costs. With the shift to decentralized finance and digital banking, this appears to have a lot of potentials.

Meanwhile, Cuba's government said it would recognise and regulate cryptocurrencies for payments on the island.

A resolution published in the Official Gazette said the Central Bank will set rules for such currencies and determine how to license providers of related services within Cuba.

The popularity of such currencies has grown among a technologically savvy group in Cuba as it has become harder to use dollars, in part because of toughened embargo rules imposed under former president Donald Trump.

The machine, locally dubbed ""la bitcoinera,"" allows users to acquire Bitcoin and Ethereum using the local lempira currency and was installed in an office tower in the capital of Tegucigalpa by Honduran firm TGU Consulting Group.

Juan Mayen, 28, chief executive of TGU, led the effort to bring the ATM to Honduras in hopes of educating people about virtual assets through first-hand experience.

Until now, there was no automated way to buy crypto-currencies, he said.

""You had to do it peer-to-peer, look for someone who ... was willing to do it, meet in person and carry X amount of cash, which is very inconvenient and dangerous given the environment in Honduras,"" he said.

On Friday, one Ethereum was trading at $3,237 (roughly Rs. 2.37 lakhs), and Bitcoin; $48,140 (roughly Rs. 35.38 lakhs). If the service is popular, Mayen said he hoped to install more units.

To make a purchase, users have to scan official identification and input personal data such as a phone number.

Many software developers in Honduras are already paid in cryptocurrencies, Mayen said, adding that it will also be a cheaper option to send remittances.

In 2020, Hondurans living abroad - mainly the United States - sent $5.7 billion (roughly Rs. 41,893 crores), about 20 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), in remittances.

The Congress of El Salvador approved in June a proposal by President Nayib Bukele to make the country the first in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.

Elsewhere in the region, lawmakers presented draft bills in Panama that regulate the use of Bitcoin and its status as a legal tender.

Bitcoin price in India was around Rs. 37.74 lakhs and price of Ethereum was around Rs. 2.5 lakhs on August 28.

These Cryptocurrencies are doing potentially well in the market

The bitcoin price has failed to find footing over $50,000 per bitcoin, dropping back towards $45,000. The second-largest cryptocurrency by value, ethereum, which has outperformed bitcoin over the last year, has also struggled—dropping back toward $3,000 per ether token this week.

With crypto traders and investors desperately looking for direction, the chief executive of financial advisory group deVere has said he expects ethereum to continue to outpace bitcoin this year and has given cardano's ADA token a September price target of $3, up 16% from its current price.

""Cardano is now just behind the major headline grabbers bitcoin and ethereum,"" deVere's CEO Nigel Green said in emailed comments this week. ""I believe that the price of cardano will reach all-time highs in the next month, hitting more than $3.""

Green points to ""three main drivers"" pushing the cardano price higher, including the ""broader crypto market rally,"" a closely-watched September upgrade that will give cardano smart contract functionality similar to ethereum, and cardano's green energy credentials compared to bitcoin and other similar energy-intensive cryptocurrencies.

Earlier this month, Green said he expects ethereum, worth a combined $365 billion, to eventually eclipse the market capitalization of bitcoin, currently worth more than twice as much at almost $900 billion.

Green pointed to ethereum's ""higher level of real-use potential"" and ""investor enthusiasm for the game-changing transition to ETH 2.0."" The long-awaited ethereum upgrade, designed to make its blockchain more scalable, sustainable and secure, was begun late last year and isn't expected to be completed until well into 2022.

""Ethereum is more useful than bitcoin and has tech advantages over its better-known rival. Ultimately, this will mean that its value will exceed that of bitcoin—probably within five years.""

Elsewhere, bitcoin and crypto market watchers are feeling upbeat about the bitcoin price due to a number of recent positive developments.

""From the lows of July, when the price briefly dipped below $30,000, the rate is up 72%, peaking at the start of the week, so a corrective pullback offsets some of the short-term overheating,"" Alex Kuptsikevch, senior financial analyst at FxPro, said in emailed comments and pointing to a recovery in bitcoin's computing power after China's latest crackdown and banking giant Citigroup C eyeing regulatory approval to launch bitcoin futures trading on the CME.

""Further declines down to $42,000-$44,000 are not beyond the market's usual pullbacks, but a deeper dive would bring back a more negative scenario.""","('https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F1214132428%2F0x0.jpg',)",none

Magnetic Managing Director Megan Kaspar, who called ether's tripling to top $3,000 back when it was still closer to $1,000 in January, told Yahoo Finance Friday that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could still hit her $8,000 to $10,000 price target in 2021.

""Investors are still using crypto as a favorite tool to hedge against inflation,"" she said, adding that two new upgrades are likely to catapult the ethereum network when completed. Those proposals will initiate the ""burn"" or elimination of the fractions of ether that had previously been paid to miners in transactions.

""Towards the end of the year, beginning of next year, we'll have about a million worth of ethereum coming out of supply. So that will initiate it becoming a deflationary asset,"" Kaspar said.

At the same time, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, transacting on the ethereum network have been attracting a lot more attention lately. This week, the cartoon image of a rock, offered through the EtherRock NFT collection, was sold for more than $1.7 million. Overall, monthly NFT sales hit a record high near $900 million during August, according to industry tracker NonFungible.

That spike in attention is continuing to bring people into ethereum, since many of the NFT sales on sites like OpenSea and others price NFT auctions in ether.

""I think we'll continue to see this as the younger generation feels comfortable buying and owning assets that are not physical, and that, again, is sort of the tech trend that we're moving towards in dematerialization,"" Kaspar said.

2021-08-30,CNBC,Cuba's central bank now recognizes cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/cubas-central-bank-now-recognizes-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin.html,"Thousands of Cubans take part in rare protests against the communist government, marching through a town chanting ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""We want liberty"" in Havana, on July 11, 2021.

Cuba will now recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, citing ""reasons of socioeconomic interest.""

Resolution 215, which was published Thursday in the state-run Official Gazette, says the central bank will set new rules for how to deal with digital currencies. Commercial providers of related services will now need a license from the central bank to continue operations.

The American embargo on the communist state has turned Cuba into a pariah in the global economy. Cuba's decision to join El Salvador in embracing decentralized virtual cash could help the country to circumvent the U.S. sanctions regime, which was dialed up under former President Donald Trump and has been extended under President Joe Biden.

""It's historic that they are embracing it,"" said Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst, who spent four years working in crypto in Cuba.

""This is a conservative government still set in traditional Marxist ways. In fact, the communist Cuban central bank was founded by Che Guevara. The fact that they are cautiously regulating shows they are interested in what it can bring them,"" Boaz said.

Sending and receiving money between the U.S. and Cuba became extremely difficult under the Trump administration, according to Dr. Mrinalini Tankha, a professor of anthropology at Portland State University, who has been doing research on Cuba for 10 years.

In 2020, Western Union, a particularly significant channel for remittances that had been operating in Cuba for more than 20 years, shuttered all of its 400-plus locations, amid increasingly aggressive Trump-era sanctions.

The process of getting money into and out of the country was made even more complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Before the Covid outbreak, Tankha said, some Cubans would turn to underground and somewhat semi-formalized courier services called mulas, where agencies would carry cash to Cuba and distribute it to people on the island. But as the pandemic grounded flights around the world, even this path to cash became much more difficult, she said.

It was this desperate need of cash — against a backdrop of a global pandemic and blocked access to the world economy — that helped foment a rise in crypto adoption in Cuba, experts say.

""There is a kind of niche sector of people who have turned to cryptocurrency,"" said Tankha.

She credits the burgeoning crypto community for the rise of the internet in Cuba, as well as the fact that there are so many more people who have smartphones and 3G connectivity. A weak local currency is also a factor likely contributing to the appeal of bitcoin.

The use case for crypto in Cuba transcends the cross-border transfer of money. It's also about Cubans looking to open up their income-generating potential.

""If you're a software developer, or if you're an NFT artist, you could actually get paid through cryptocurrency for your labor, and I think that's where the potential actually is,"" said Tankha. ""It opens up a whole new economy for Cubans to participate in.""

Photographer Gabriel Guerra Bianchini is doing just that. Havana-based Bianchini was one of the first artists in Cuba to break into the world of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.

""My first work sold in six days for 1.6 ethereum,"" said Bianchini. ""This is bigger than just making money. This is really freedom.""

However, receiving funds, even via crypto channels, requires some creativity, because many of the exchanges require know-your-customer compliance.

""The minute that Cubans participate in this ecosystem, they face a lot of risks, even if they're operating with a VPN where they're able to hide their location,"" said Tankha.

Tankha told CNBC that many exchanges, including those not based in the U.S., continue to geo-block Cubans.

Experts told CNBC that it is still a long road ahead for mass adoption of crypto in Cuba.

The resolution itself — while a promising sign for Cubans keen to participate in the world economy via bitcoin rails — is hardly a warm embrace of all things crypto. The text includes a healthy dose of skepticism, such as a disclaimer warning citizens about the risks of virtual assets and the ancillary service providers, which the government says operate at the ""margins of the banking and financial system.""

But Sobrado is optimistic that any sort of regulatory attention with respect to crypto is a good thing.

""Regulators around the world, from communist Cuba's central bank to the SEC, are trying to come to grips with the cryptocurrency industry. This implies that crypto is a global phenomenon and regulators have decided that it's here to stay and worth engaging with,"" said Sobrado.

""Strangely enough it's bringing some sort of legitimacy to the space. It's gotten too big to ignore,"" he said.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106910035-1626177480909-gettyimages-1233929408-AFP_9ER3N8.jpeg?v=1627050044',)",none
2021-08-30,Cointelegraph,Cuba set to recognize and regulate cryptocurrency,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cuba-set-to-recognize-and-regulate-cryptocurrency,"The Cuban government is reportedly planning to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies for payments.

According to Aljazeera, the Caribbean nation’s central bank will establish rules for mainstreaming cryptocurrency transactions. Cuban authorities are also expected to distribute relevant licenses to businesses based on the crypto-related services they provide.

Some sources claim that the move to allow cryptocurrency as a legal tender has been well received by Cuba’s tech-savvy population as the country had to temporarily stop accepting cash bank deposits in United States dollars, given tighter restrictions set by former U.S. President Donald Trump.

Struggling economies, such as El Salvador, have also started mainstreaming Bitcoin (BTC) adoption. On Monday, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele announced the construction of country-wide infrastructure to support the adoption of Bitcoin.

El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption policy can reduce overall remittance costs and potentially transform the remittance landscape across Central America, according to the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI).

Dante Mossi, executive president of CABEI, believes that El Salvador’s “out of this world experiment” could result in greater financial inclusion, and thus, it is in CABEI’s best interest to help El Salvador create a technical framework for Bitcoin adoption.","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDgvZThlYzNhNTgtMjljOC00OGFjLThkMDktMTU2ZGM3YzIzY2U2LmpwZw==.jpg',)",none
2021-08-30,Al Jazeera,"Cuba to recognise, regulate cryptocurrency",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/27/cuba-to-recognise-regulate-cryptocurrency-govt-resolution,"Popularity of the digital currency has grown in Cuba, in part because of restrictions on remittances from the US.

Cuba has said it will recognise – and regulate – cryptocurrencies for payments on the island in a move that could help to circumvent American sanctions.

A resolution published in the Official Gazette on Thursday said the central bank will set rules on cryptocurrencies and determine how to license providers of related services within the communist state.

The announcement comes as the popularity of cryptocurrency has grown in Cuba among some technologically savvy groups, as it has become increasingly difficult to send and use US dollars on the island, in part because of toughened embargo rules imposed under former United States President Donald Trump.

While some expected President Joe Biden to seek to normalise relations, as former President Barack Obama did, he has instead taken a harder line, imposing further sanctions against Cuban officials following crackdowns on rare protests in the country.





Cuba’s move comes after El Salvador recently announced it would recognise the use of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as a way to encourage remittances from its citizens living abroad.

The currencies, which can shift wildly in value, are usually independent of any central bank and use widely distributed blockchain computer codes to keep track of transfers.

Because they can be used for long-distance transactions that are supposedly anonymous, they are often popular with people attempting to evade government regulations, which could include circumventing US restrictions on sending money to Cuba.





The resolution said the central bank can authorise use of cryptocurrencies “for reasons of socioeconomic interest” but with the state assuring operations are controlled.

It also explicitly noted that operations could not involve illegal activities.

A local cryptocurrency expert, programmer Erich García, told The Associated Press some Cubans are already using such devices, often via gift cards, for online purchases.","('https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AP21089552118817.jpg?resize=1200%2C630',)",none

The noted economist said cryptocurrencies have a “potential future” if they are regulated well.

The 58-year-old noted economist also seemed optimistic about well-regulated stable coins, which are digital currencies linked to an underlying asset like currency or gold. He, however, called for appropriate regulations for such assets, as per the Reuters report.

Rajan, who is a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told the news agency that the fundamentals driving the valuations of cryptocurrencies remain unclear.

“Right now, in this heady environment with asset prices really picking up, many cryptos are also being valued — not so much as a means of payments — but as assets in their own right,” he said.

He went on to say that cryptocurrencies have not reached a position when they will be “your last resort” in a doomsday scenario, adding that he would be confident about the values of virtual coins one they find proper use cases.

“I think the value of cryptos has to be seen more in terms of are they going to be useful in the system going forward. Yes, some of them have value because they have value, and maybe that will persist. I'm not going to say that bitcoin is going to implode tomorrow. But I will say that I would be much more confident about the value of these cryptos once they find proper use cases, and the technology is evolving to make that happen,"" Rajan said.

“Cross border payments are one area which is wide open, because of the huge transaction costs of making cross border payments,"" Rajan was quoted as saying by the news agency.

Raghuram Rajan’s statement on cryptocurrencies comes at a time when the popularity of virtual coin has witnessed a sharp rise in India. Over 1.5 crore Indians have purchased cryptocurrency assets and investments in virtual coins have increased sharply despite uncertainty.

Cryptocurrencies have exploded in popularity over the last several months. Of course, the most popular remains bitcoin.

But some other smaller cryptos are gaining serious steam as well, as the concept of digital currencies continues to seep into the public consciousness.

However, it can be difficult to know which cryptocurrencies to invest in, or whether you should in the first place. There are currently thousands of different types of coins on the market. And some - like dogecoin, which was founded as a joke - don't appear to be serious. Others, like some built on the Ethereum blockchain, appear to have better use cases.

On the other hand, Ether, the rival currency of Bitcoin was trading at $3,124 or down 2.81 per cent at the time of this article. It was trading down 3.46 per cent over the last week. The market cap for Ether stood at $366.28.72 billion.

According to ZebPay’s trade desk, Ethereum faces a stiff resistance at $3,335, which it hasn’t been able to beat, which means that bears are defending aggressively. Signs of weakness might emerge, if the asset turns close to $3,000. Another important event to watch out for is the ETH options expiry due tomorrow, which might impact the spot prices too.

“Ether made a ‘Double Bottom pattern or a ‘W’ pattern at $1,721. It completed the pattern at $2,400 giving a breakout above the neckline with good volumes and the asset witnessed a sharp rally surging almost by 96.8% making the high of $3,380. Post this move, the asset has faced stiff resistance around the $3,400 mark and the prices are consolidating and trading in a broad range from $3,350 to $2,975. Breakouts on either side will further decide the trend for the asset. Ether resistance 1: $3,400, resistance 2: $3,800, support 1 $2,950, support 2 $2,650, Zebpay’s trade desk said.

The third spot was occupied by Cardano, which was trading at $2.59, down 4.52 per cent at the time of this article. The Cardano was trading up 6.89 per cent over the last week. Binance Coin stood at $483.83, up 5.09 per cent over the past 24 hours. The Binance Coin was trading up 12.13 per cent over the last week. The market cap for Binance Coin stood at $81.3 billion.

The global crypto market cap is $2.02 trillion, a 3.46 per cent decrease over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $111.24 billion, which makes a 1.42 per cent decrease.

The volume of all stable coins is now $88.0 billion, which is 79.13 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per Coinmarketcap.com.

“The Altcoin markets have formed similar charts like Bitcoin. It is trading around the buy zone. Markets always give opportunity for the new Investors to start their journey. One needs to approach the markets with proper risk assessment and diversify. Buying on support has most of the times proven to be a good strategy with a long term view, some of the disciplined. Investors even do SIP’s buying the dips. The Key levels for Altcoin markets-Resistance - $1.4 trillion, Support - $1 trillion,” Siddharth Menon, COO WazirX.

A resolution published in the Official Gazette said the Central Bank will set rules for such currencies and determine how to license providers of related services within Cuba.

The popularity of such currencies has grown among a technologically savvy group in Cuba as it has become harder to use dollars, in part because of toughened embargo rules imposed under former President Donald Trump.

The Central American nation of El Salvador recently announced it would recognise use of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as a way to encourage remittances from its citizens living abroad. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.88 lakhs as of 11am IST on August 27.

The currencies, which can wobbly wildly up and down in value, are usually independent of any central bank and use widely distributed blockchain computer codes to keep track of transfers.

Because they can be used for long-distance transactions that are supposedly anonymous, they are often popular with people attempting to evade government regulations — presumably including US restrictions on sending money to places such as Cuba.

The resolution says the Central Bank can authorise use of cryptocurrencies “for reasons of socioeconomic interest” but with the state assuring that their operations are controlled. It also explicitly noted that operations could not involve illegal activities.

A local cryptocurrency expert, programmer Erich García, said some Cubans are already using such devices, often via gift cards, for online purchases.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_disco_reuters_1622203490843.jpg',)",none

2021-08-30,NDTV,"Are Cryptocurrencies Interconvertible? Yes, But Beware Of Volatility",https://www.ndtv.com/business/are-cryptocurrencies-interconvertible-have-a-look-2516860,"In India, crypto finance is a grey zone and most businesses prefer cash or e-commerce

Cryptocurrency is getting more and more popular with every passing day. From young entrepreneurs to global business magnates, all have been dazed by this new disruption in the global economic setup. But a few investors or potential investors are still questioning certain features of the crypto coins. In India, crypto finance remains a grey zone and most businesses prefer cash or e-commerce transactions. The scenario may change in the future but for now, inter convertibility of cryptocurrency can save us from that.

Many wonder whether or not it is possible to convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency or cash. The answer is yes. Cryptocurrency is interconvertible to fiat currency. You should remember that crypto money is not the same as money earned in games or such platforms but it is real money though you can't touch it or see it.

Convertible virtual or digital currency

Cryptocurrencies, unlike virtual currencies earned in video games, are exchangeable for real currency and are called convertible virtual currency. It refers to such currency that can be used as a substitute for real and legally recognised currency though it may not have a legal tender. These conversions can be easily made through currency exchange services or peer-to-peer networks. Bitcoin, Ether and Ripple are some examples of interconvertible crypto. However, Bitcoin remains the most popular in the game.

How to convert cryptocurrency into cash?

Let us focus on two main ways in which this can be done:

1) One way is to convert the crypto money through a currency exchange system or a broker. Experts call this method safe and secure but it is also time-consuming. You request a broker to take your crypto deposit and transfer the cash to your account. Due to certain restrictions, the withdrawal has to be made through the same account through which the deposit was carried out. The transfer of the amount may take a few days.

2) Another method involves appealing to peer-to-peer platforms. You simply need to sell your digital currency in return for cash. This is a quick and anonymous method. However, beware of fraudulent users.

Are you having second thoughts before converting crypto?

Cryptocurrency is highly volatile. Its value fluctuates very often and may rise or dip suddenly. Any decision to convert them requires a good judgement of the future prospects of the crypto.

Turning digital currency into cash may also subject it to taxation. Digital currency in India is yet not under any regulation. However, once converted into fiat currency, there's a high probability that it will be counted under taxable assets.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/s9ng9nc_cryptocurrrency-generic650_625x300_11_August_21.jpg',)",none

The most popular virtual token broke above $50,000 level earlier this week for the first time since mid-May. Bitcoin is up 63% this year (year-to-date), though, far away from its record just below $65,000 in April.

As per CoinDesk, Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, plunged to $3,129.7, trading with cuts of nearly 3%. Dogecoin, on the other hand, declined 6% to $0.27. Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also plummeted over the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrency funds saw their first inflows in seven weeks as investors poured money into altcoins such as ether, cardano, and Solana last week, according to a report by digital-asset manager CoinShares.

Digital asset funds saw net inflows of $21 million last week. However, during the six-week period, the longest losing streak since January 2018, digital asset investment products saw total redemption of $115 million.

However, bitcoin saw its seventh straight week of outflows, as investors took out $2.8 million from funds based on the world’s biggest cryptocurrency during last week. Ether saw minor inflows totalling $3.2 million last week along with other altcoins such as cardano, litecoin and polkadot, which saw inflows of $6.4 million, $1.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Later, supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped the Bitcoin rally.

The industry’s second-largest asset has enjoyed a fruitful month of price action, rallying from $1,700 in July to a monthly high in August of $3,390.

However, the tide appears to have turned in the short-term, with Ethereum failing to close a daily candle above $3,320 following a string of stubborn attempts.

Key levels of support remain at $3,000 and $2,880, although it must be noted that if Ethereum can muster some strength from its current region, it could well have enough fuel to break the monthly high given the number of short positions that can be squeezed.

Much of it will depend on the trajectory of Bitcoin, which is trading at $47,000 after another miserable stab at the psychological level of resistance at $50,000.

If Bitcoin can break $50,000 on convincing volume it would indicate a clear change in behaviour, which would reinforce the theory that a “double bubble” scenario may come into play like in 2013.

This pattern was established in 2013 when the Bitcoin bull market formed two major tops before entering an inevitable bear market.

About Ethereum

Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.

Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn’t get buy-in to his proposal.

However, many financial experts would advise against going all in on one investment, especially within the crypto space. Cryptocurrency can be a very risky investment in general, and experts say altcoins can be even more so.

""Risk can be measured in a variety of different ways,"" Meltem Demirors, CoinShares chief strategy officer, previously told CNBC Make It. But ""many of these assets are much more risky than bitcoin and ethereum.""

It's possible to lose your entire investment regardless of how careful you are.

Nonetheless, Contessoto is still bullish on both dogecoin and Cardano.

Since Contessoto didn't buy ether, the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain, early on, he views Cardano as the ""next best bet,"" he says. Supporters of Cardano, like Contessoto, see it as a competitor to Ethereum since its creator, Charles Hoskinson, is also a co-founder of Ethereum.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106872490-1624459859222-106872490-1619110744500-image0_1.jpg?v=1626795879',)",none

The U.S. authorities have trained over 50 Nigerian investigators and prosecutors to tackle cryptocurrency-enabled organised crimes.

This was contained in a tweet posted via the verified Twitter account of the U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday.

The training, which was held virtually, focused on enhancing the capacity of Nigerian investigators to investigate cryptocurrency.

The webinar was a collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the U.S. Embassy in Kenya Addis Ababa, the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and the U.S. government on policies and programmes to combat international narcotics and crimes.

“@TheJusticeDept’s #OPDAT @StateINL funded ICHIPs in @USEmbassyAddis and @USinNigeria and @FBI and @US_AU provided cryptocurrency basics webinar to more than 50 investigators and prosecutors in Nigeria to enhance Nigerians’ ability to investigate cryptocurrency,” the Tweet read.

Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and others, that can be used to buy goods and services.

They are also traded for profit.

Being unregulated and requiring no physical bank vaults, they provide a relatively safe haven for criminals to launder proceeds of corruption, fraud, drug trafficking, and other heinous crimes.

There are also concerns about their security with many sophisticated fraudsters able to hack into the digital vaults to steal them from their owners.

A study by Whitestream, an Israeli-based blockchain analytics firm, regarded Nigeria’s commercial hub as the ‘Focal Point’ for Africa’s crypto scams.

The research indicated that many scammers create a persona of luxurious life achieved from the wealth created with cryptocurrency investments into attract unsuspecting victims.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had barred commercial banks and other financial institutions from transacting with cryptocurrency in fear of the risks it poses to investments and the economy at large.

In justifying the essence of the ban, Osita Nwanisobi, CBN Acting Director of Communications, in a statement in February, explained that cryptocurrencies transaction was devoid of proper regulation and prone to financial crimes in the country.

The apex bank said the its decision is based on “significant risks that transacting in cryptocurrencies portend – risks of loss of investments, money laundering, terrorism financing, illicit fund flows and criminal activities.”","('https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/08/U.S.-flag.jpg',)",none
2021-08-30,NDTV.com,''Cryptos Won't Be Your Last Resort In A Doomsday Scenario'': Raghuram Rajan,https://www.ndtv.com/business/cryptos-wont-be-your-last-resort-in-a-doomsday-scenario-raghuram-rajan-on-rising-cryptocurrency-transactions-2519675,"Raghuram Rajan is a professor of finance at University of Chicago Booth School of Business

While discussing the financial stability of green investments and cyber security threats, Raghuram Rajan, Former Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that cryptocurrency will not be the last resort in a doomsday scenario. ''I would be much more confident about the value of these cryptos once they find proper use cases, such as an effective means of payment, especially in cross-border transactions,'' said Mr Rajan in an interview with news agency Reuters.

The comments from the top economist come at a time when leading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum have recently witnessed a rebound against the US dollar, after months of registering an incessant decline in prices. The recent surge in crypto prices has strengthened investor sentiment as people have recovered losses in digital currencies after several months.

Mr Rajan, who earlier served as the Chief Economist and Director of Research at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that central banks should now focus on the financial stability of green investments, and other ''threats'' such as crypto currencies and cyber security. (Also Read: Central Banks Should Not Mandate 'Green' Investments: Raghuram Rajan )

However, the former RBI Governor remained optimistic on the prospects of digital currency, claiming that crypto currencies have a ""potential future,"" particularly well-regulated stablecoins. ''But it wasn't clear what fundamentals were backing their valuations other than a ""heady environment,"" with easy monetary policy fuelling all asset prices,'' added Mr Rajan.

Mr Rajan, who is a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said that central banks should not mandate green investments and should steer clear of politically driven unlegislated areas.

On Thursday, August 26, the world's most popular and largest cryptocurrency by market cap - bitcoin was last trading 2.59 per cent lower at $47,187.4 against the US dollar.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2018-12/hl94j36o_raghuram-rajan-reuters-650_625x300_14_December_18.jpg',)",none

The former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was more positive on well-regulated stablecoins. At the same time, he called for quick appropriate regulations for stablecoins.

A stablecoin is a digital currency that is linked to an underlying asset, such as a national currency like the US dollar or a precious metal like gold.

According to the Reuters report, Rajan was, however, not clear on the fundamentals that were driving the valuations of cryptocurrencies.

“Right now, in this heady environment with asset prices really picking up, many cryptos are also being valued — not so much as a means of payments — but as assets in their own right,"" Rajan, who is professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told Reuters.

Even in India, crypto currency exchanges are urging the government to define cryptocurrencies as digital assets and not as currency. As per industry experts, this would help the government address all its legitimate concerns with regards to financial risks associated with crypto.

Meanwhile, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the legislation on cryptocurrencies is awaiting Cabinet approval.

Rajan in his interaction with Reuters opined that some cryptocurrencies might find a way to become an effective means of payment despite their fluctuating values.

“Cross border payments are one area which is wide open, because of the huge transaction costs of making cross border payments,"" he said.

In India, growth-wise, the crypto industry has grown from four-five million people in 2018 to 15-20 million investors now with more than $1.5 billion invested. This has in part been driven by the superlative returns given by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether and dogecoin over the past three years.

Rajan believes that for cryptocurrency prices to keep on rising, these digital assets will need to find a proper use case.

“I think the value of cryptos has to be seen more in terms of are they going to be useful in the system going forward. Yes, some of them have value because they have value, and maybe that will persist. I'm not going to say that bitcoin is going to implode tomorrow. But I will say that I would be much more confident about the value of these cryptos once they find proper use cases, and the technology is evolving to make that happen,"" he said.

2021-08-30,Cointelegraph,Will Polkadot save decentralized finance from Ethereum’s scaling problems?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-polkadot-save-decentralized-finance-from-ethereum-s-scaling-problems,"Web 3.0, interoperability and layer zero are all terms tossed around when describing Polkadot. But what do they mean, and how will they impact the internet and cryptocurrency market? Cointelegraph Research’s new report explores how Polkadot is tackling distributed ledger scalability and centralization of the web simultaneously.

For starters, imagine a world where Facebook is replaced by a decentralized social media application built on Polkadot. This is what projects like Subsocial are building in their platforms, which let users determine what data to keep private and what to share. Users can leverage their data by monetizing it on Ocean Market, retaining full control at all times, while AI researchers and data scientists can access that data without exposing it, keeping it secure from breaches.

Not happy about the bank charging overdraft fees when your account balance reaches below $0.00? Well, one Polkadot-based project called Acala has built an on-chain automatic scheduler that is similar to a decentralized version of Stripe. This enables users to automatically transfer staking rewards to their wallet address, which can be linked to a physical credit card. This means that a person can be paid for helping to secure a decentralized money and banking system and that the money they earn can be sent to a credit card and used to buy a coffee at Starbucks. Instead of spending their staking rewards, validators could trade them for other assets on decentralized exchanges like Polkadex or create collateralized debt positions on Centrifuge in order to buy tangible assets like a house.

This report covers:

How Polkadot allows blockchains with different structures to co-exist in an interoperable environment with shared security.

How the system of slot auctions allows projects to compete for the right to remain connected to the network.

How the ecosystem around Polkadot gave rise to a wide variety of decentralized products, from social networks to cloud computation and prediction markets.

Does Polkadot deliver what Ethereum promised?

Ethereum’s consensus mechanism forces all nodes to validate all transactions. In contrast, the Polkadot blockchain breaks up batches of new transactions into many shards and processes them in parallel. The blockchains plugging into the network can have very different rules of operation, transaction processing and capabilities, giving the whole system much more flexibility.

Polkadot is trying to achieve scalability without decreasing the network’s security. This famous problem, known as the “blockchain trilemma,” was elucidated by one of Ethereum’s co-founders, Vitalik Buterin himself.

In contrast with Ethereum’s single blockchain design, Polkadot has many different blockchains, called parachains, that plug into one main blockchain, which is also referred to as the Relay Chain or layer zero. Similar to the hub-and-spoke model commonly used in airport design, connecting disparate blockchains via the central Relay Chain establishes a way to send messages and transactions across multiple blockchains without slowing down traffic on the transaction highway. Layer zero refers to the concept that layer-one protocols, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, could be spokes and Polkadot could be the hub. For example, the nonfungible token project Bit.Country is a Substrate-based blockchain that uses a bridge with Ethereum. This enables assets to flow between Ethereum and metaverses built on Bit.Country’s TEWAI blockchain.

No smart contracts on Polkadot

Since Polkadot’s Relay Chain does not have smart contracts, it’s up to the blockchains plugged into Polkadot to enable smart contracts. For example, one parachain called Moonbeam has full compatibility with Ethereum contracts. Moonbeam’s developers have created a way to interact with digital currencies built on Polkadot via MetaMask, the popular web browser wallet for decentralized finance. This means that tokens built on Polkadot’s Substrate, which is a blockchain development tool, can be seamlessly sent to Ethereum wallets and smart contract addresses.

The next layer of the Polkadot ecosystem includes projects building on top of the blockchains that are built on top of the Relay Chain. For example, Ocean Protocol is in the process of deploying its smart contracts onto the Moonbeam blockchain. By building on top of Moonbeam, the OCEAN token will be compatible with both Polkadot and Ethereum blockchain applications.

Rebuilding Ethereum’s network on Polkadot

The improved scalability of Polkadot enables many projects to overcome Etheruem’s high transaction fees and the low number of transactions per second. Similar to Ethereum’s decentralized data storage projects such as Filecoin, Sia or Storj, Crust Network is building a similar solution on top of Polkadot. Unlike Ethereum-based projects, Crust Network isn’t constrained by Ethereum’s scalability problems. Many of the applications we have come to love on Ethereum are being rebuilt on the Polkadot network or integrated via chain-agnostic gateways.

The Polkadot ecosystem is brimming with projects ranging from decentralized cloud computing with Phala Network to cross-chain custodial wallets such as the browser-based MathWallet. The hardware-based virtual private network project Deeper Network has already sold over 10,000 physical devices on Indiegogo, Amazon and BestBuy. Deeper’s blockchain solution coordinates all devices and routing in a privacy-preserving way, holds the device registry (in the form of public-key infrastructure), and manages staking and reputation subsystems.","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDgvMmE4NmU1OTUtYmMxYy00YmVhLTg2ZjAtZTgxMzg2NzMyYjg0LmpwZw==.jpg',)",none

Arbitrage involves trading one cryptocurrency for another, or trading the same cryptocurrency on different exchanges. This method is preferred by people who are accustomed to day trading, and have an even higher appetite for risk than those who are simply day trading.

Being a hands-on trader reveals many imbalances in the market, and thus opportunities for profit each day.

For example, let’s assume XYZ coin is priced at ₹10 on one exchange and at ₹11 on the second. A person could then buy ten XYZ coins on the first exchange at ₹100, transfer the coin to the second exchange, and then sell the cryptocurrency for ₹110.

The absolute gain would seem to be ₹10. However, transaction costs could eat away as much as ₹8 and leave investors with a profit of only ₹2.

This is similar to how investors play fiat currencies against each other in traditional currency markets.

There could be more complex routes, such as transferring value between three currencies on the same exchange, to end up with a larger quantity of the first currency. This is usually done when the value of newer cryptocurrencies rises or falls considerably within minutes.

In other instances, ‘stablecoins’ whose value remains ‘tethered’ to specific national currencies – like Tether (USDT) which will remain at 1 USD – may be useful to benefit from imbalanced prices.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/85653413/Cryptocurrency-isnt-for-everyone-but-heres-how-some-are-using-digital-tokens-to-make-money.jpg',)",none

While only 14% of U.S. adults own crypto, according to a 2021 report from crypto exchange Gemini, around 63% of Americans classify themselves as ""crypto curious.""

While prices took a tumble earlier this year, many cryptocurrencies are gaining steam, once again. Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), for example, is inching closer to $50,000 per token, its highest price since May.

Now that crypto prices are rebounding, is it time to invest? Here's what you need to know.

How safe is cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency falls into the ""high risk, high reward"" category of investments. It's riskier than investing in stocks because it's still highly speculative at this point.

Stocks have a long history of growth over time, while cryptocurrency is still relatively new. While it could become mainstream and have real uses in society, nobody knows for certain whether that will happen.

That doesn't necessarily mean cryptocurrency is a bad investment or that you shouldn't buy it. If it does find real-life utility, it could potentially change the world -- and those who invested early on could make a lot of money. But it's important to consider your tolerance for risk before you buy.

If you're a risk-averse investor and are worried about losing money on your investments, cryptocurrency may not be the best fit for you. There's a chance that it may not succeed over time, and if that happens, you could lose all the money you invest.

Similarly, cryptocurrency is famous for its volatility. Bitcoin has lost roughly 80% of its value in the past, and Ethereum once lost nearly 95% of its value over the span of a year. If you know you'd lose sleep if your investments plummeted, crypto may not be for you.

On the other hand, if you're willing to take on a fair amount of risk for the potential to earn lucrative rewards, you may be a strong candidate for this type of investment. But if you do choose to buy, there are a few things to consider first.

How to invest safely

If you do decide to invest in cryptocurrency, it's important to be strategic about it. First, only invest money you can realistically afford to lose. There are never any guarantees when it comes to investing, but because crypto carries more risk than the average stock, it's especially important to avoid investing more than you can afford.

Also, make sure you have at least three to six months' worth of savings set aside in an emergency fund. Because crypto is so volatile, there's a chance prices could fall again after you invest. If you face an unexpected expense and have to cash out your investments, the last thing you want is to sell your cryptocurrency when prices are at rock bottom. When you have a healthy stash of savings, you can keep your money invested until prices recover.

Finally, do your research when deciding which cryptocurrency to buy. Not all of them are created equal, and some are riskier than others. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the biggest names in the crypto space, but there are countless others.

The best investments are the ones that will continue growing over time, so be sure you're keeping a long-term outlook as you're researching -- not looking for cryptocurrencies that will help you ""get rich quick.""

Cryptocurrency is risky, but that doesn't mean it's a bad investment. Before you buy, make sure you can afford to invest and are relatively comfortable with volatility and risk. Crypto isn't right for everyone, but it could potentially be the right investment for you.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640552/bitcoin-token-with-stock-market-crash-behind-it.jpg',)",none

These cryptocurrencies are great for surprise gifts!

Cryptocurrencies make for good long-term investments. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Dogecoin investments are expected to give great returns and those profits can be put to good use. So, why not look at cryptocurrencies as a gift option? With more than 7,000 coins in the crypto market, here are some of the most affordable and exceptional cryptocurrencies to give away as a gift.

1. Dogecoin

Affordable and with great potential, Dogecoin is one of the most viable cryptocurrencies to invest in. Thanks to the celebrity hype started by Elon Musk, Dogecoin has a fluctuating price value that, according to experts, will grow to a new level by the end of 2021.

2. Ethereum

If you want to give a crypto coin to someone close to you, Ethereum is the silver of the cryptocurrency market. Crypto analysts also believe that Ethereum is worth the investment as Ethereum’s blockchain has seen massive success in transforming the DeFi industry with smart contracts.

3. VeChain

VeChain is an underrated cryptocurrency that is a good option for the long term. The VeChain coin works on the VeChain Thor Blockchain that is specially designed for handling supply chain management and various business processes by using distributed ledgers.

4. XRP

XRP came under the spotlight in 2017 and since then, the coin grew to become one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. It’s the favorite cryptocurrency of the global banking industry with utilities that can transform bank transfers and payments. An ace cryptocurrency investment, Ripple has already been adopted by several banks which leverages its value in the market.

5. Cardano

Cardano is the third most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cardano is a coin to look out for as its long-term plans include eliminating the current challenges of decentralized finance. Since last year, Cardano saw an incredible growth of 1750%.

6. Stellar Lumen

Stellar Lumen aims to provide a cheap platform for transactions in emerging markets. The blockchain enables easy asset-building as investors can launch their own tokens and create crypto exchanges. This affordable cryptocurrency will make up for a wise gift.

7. EOS

EOS has one of the best blockchain networks that support the development of distributed apps. This blockchain can eliminate transaction fees and can allow transactions from Visa and MasterCard networks. Experts predict that by the end of 2023, EOS will reach the US$80 mark.

8. Polygon

Various blockchains come with their own utilities and Polygon aims to unite them. This Ethereum-compatible blockchain has high ambitions which, when succeeded, will create a boom in the crypto market.

9. Monero

Monero enhances the privacy of the users. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Monero ensures the user’s crypto wallet address is never made public on the blockchain. As many investors are looking for a more secure crypto option, Monero will lead the pack at the right time.

10. NEO

NEO is a Chinese cryptocurrency that wants to compete with Ethereum. It supports smart contracts for a wide variety of users and shows the potential to become one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in 2021.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Top-cryptocurrencies-to-give-away-as-gift-.jpg',)",none
2021-08-30,India Today,"Cryptocurrency prices today: Bitcoin falls as weakness continues, other virtual coins follow",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/cryptocurrency-prices-on-august-26-update-bitcoin-dogecoin-ether-cardano-value-1845537-2021-08-26,"Prices of all popular cryptocureencies prices fell sharply on Thursday.

Cryptocurrency prices continue to fall as high volatility prevailed in the virtual coin market over the past 24 hours.

Crypto prices started falling after Monday’s trading session due to heavy profit-booking, and have remained weak since then. Experts believe volatility in crypto trade is also a result of monthly options expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, is trading slightly below $47,000, down 2.95 per cent at 12:07 pm. The virtual coin’s market capitalisation has fallen sharply to $882 billion.

It may be noted that Bitcoin had touched a high of $50,000 on Monday and its market capitalisation has inched closer to $950 billion.

Ether’s (ETH) value has also eroded sharply over the past 24 hours. It was trading at $3,109, down over 3 per cent compared to its value 24 hours ago. Ether’s market capitalisation has fallen to $363 billion.

All other altcoins also lost ground, trading 3-8 per cent lower due to the selloff observed over the past 24 hours.

Commenting on the cryptocurrency market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The crypto markets were highly volatile over the past 24 hours. Such volatility is often encountered before the monthly options expiry.”

“The spot trading volume for Bitcoin was low, indicating that the markets are not directional at the moment. Despite a minor selloff in Ether, the largest Altcoin still appears to have a strong support,” he added.

“Most other Altcoins would be replicating the movement in BTC and ETH.”

Here are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:

It has ramped up security on its border with Iran - but some Afghans are still getting through.Sheltering in a drainage tunnel outside the Tatvan district of Turkey's eastern Bitlis province, Ali, a young man in his 20s from Afghanistan's Khost province, said he was waiting for transport west and wanted to go on to Europe. Around 50 others were sheltering with him.Ali said he had studied computer science and taught web and graphic design in Afghanistan. He said he had a YouTube channel where he posted videos on topics including how to make money online.""I was planning a bitcoin or ethereum mining business ... Suddenly everything changed and the Taliban took over all of Afghanistan,"" he said.""There is no internet. If there is no internet, I cannot do my job there. If we had smart phones that had a camera, the Taliban wouldn't allow it.""After trekking for weeks through Iran, migrants who enter Turkey's eastern province of Van make their way by foot, bus or boat to the town of Tatvan on the western shores of Lake Van.On their way they try to evade police checkpoints, raids on their hideouts and coast guard vessels which patrol the huge lake, where a boat carrying around 60 migrants sank last year, killing them all.Wais Muhammad Shehrzad , 30, said he left Afghanistan a month ago, paying $1,000 to traffickers and walking up to 50 hours at a time with little sustenance on the way.""Our feet are blistered, we have no clothes, no food,"" he said, taking off his shoes to show a bruised ankle, and telling others in the group to sit down to avoid being seen.Shehrzad said he was from Kabul and had worked as a shoe maker and previously as an English teacher. He wanted to get to Istanbul, find work, and send money back to his family.In recent weeks Turkish police have detained thousands of Afghan migrants among an estimated 300,000 in the country. Those caught in Bitlis are sent to a repatriation centre in Van, although Afghans are currently not sent back to their country because of the turmoil there.A day after he spoke to Reuters, Ali sent a text message. ""We are arrested by police,"" it said.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85647373,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-75964,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none

Similarly, the total crypto market volume declined about 3 per cent to $113.77 billion. Cardano blockchain has just surpassed other top altcoins to become the third largest virtual currency worldwide as network developers aim to capitalize on the surge in decentralized finance that has swept the world.Siddharth Menon, COO of WazirX , said there are positive indications on institutional demand for Bitcoin, which is roughly 24 per cent away from it's all-time high.Micheal Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, just announced that the company bought 3,907 Bitcoins between July 1 and August 23, which is roughly around $177 million. The recent purchase brings the company's total holdings to 108,992 coins.""Since the Bitcoin ban in China earlier this year, the hashrate for the Bitcoin network has made a remarkable recovery. Over the six weeks or so that followed, it slumped by more than 65 per cent due to the China ban. The hashrate is approaching early June levels and could hit a new all-time high within the next couple of months,"" Menon added.The world's biggest crypto exchange Binance is not capable of being supervised properly and poses a significant risk to consumers, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in a document.According to ZebPay's Trade Desk, Ethereum network seems to have become its own worst enemy, as the increasing adoption has contributed significantly to the rise in competitors' decentralized finance applications, and growth.

This comes after a double bounce around the $0.005 support level.KEY is making a wedge on the 4-hour time frame which is neutral. Hence, a breakout confirmation will signal ‘buy’ to investors. KEY showed signs of strong recovery after the May slump. It is likely to overcome resistance at $0.0113 to maintain this uptrend.Since KEY has a relatively lower market cap and is gaining in volumes, volatility is to be expected.

2021-08-30,NDTV.com,5 Different Types Of Cryptocurrencies And Their Importance,https://www.ndtv.com/business/5-cryptocurrencies-and-their-importance-2518509,"Blockchains are advanced computer networks that are created using mathematics and coding

Cryptocurrency has become a common point of discussion in most finance-related conversations. The digital currency has slowly begun to gain acceptance in global markets as an alternate mode of payment to fiat currency. For the unversed, cryptocurrency is a type of electronic money that is managed using blockchain technology. Blockchains are advanced computer networks that are created using mathematics and coding. Unlike fiat currencies that are issued by governments and regulated by banking authorities, cryptocurrency is completely decentralised and is not issued or regulated by any government or authority.

Cryptocurrencies are divided into coins and tokens. Coins operate on their own blockchain and hold value as they are used as money for transactions. Tokens, on the other hand, are built on an existing blockchain.

Here is a list of the 5 popular cryptocurrencies. For live prices of cryptocurrencies, click here.

1) Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency in the world. It was created in 2009. It is the first decentralised cryptocurrency that facilitated transactions using its own blockchain technology. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was priced at roughly Rs. 37.34 lakhs.

2) Ethereum

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency network that uses blockchain technology to facilitate smart contracts. It is a decentralised software that allows smart contracts to be built on its network and run on it without any control or fear of fraud by a third party. Ether is the token used to enable transactions on the Ethereum network. Ethereum is currently priced at roughly Rs. 2.46 lakhs.

3) Dogecoin

This cryptocurrency was created using a popular meme that features a Shiba Inu dog as its icon. The meme was immensely popular as is the cryptocurrency whose price skyrocketed after receiving backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Musk managed to shake up the already volatile crypto market by backing the meme coin. Dogecoin, unlike Bitcoin, has no limit on the number of coins that can be mined. It's is currently priced at Rs. 22.49.

4) Cardano

Cardano was created through a research-based approach by a team of mathematicians, engineers, and cryptographers. In the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies, Cardano claims to be a more sustainable and balanced coin when compared to the other cryptocurrencies. It is currently priced at Rs. 210.78.

5) Litecoin (LTC)

It was created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, a graduate from MIT and an engineer at Google. It was one of the first few cryptocurrencies that followed the same technology as Bitcoin. Despite being modeled on Bitcoin, Litecoin generates blocks at a faster rate, and, hence, offers a faster transaction time. It is currently priced at Rs. 13,631.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-02/kq34jumk_cryptocurrency-bitcoin-reuters_625x300_11_February_21.jpg',)",none

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization broke above $50,000 level earlier this week for the first time since mid-May. Bitcoin is up 68% this year (year-to-date), though, far away from its record just below $65,000 in April.

As per CoinDesk, Bitcoin prices were trading higher at $49,020, up more than 2%. Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, surged to $3,224, up 1%. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was trading with gains of 0.5% at $0.29. Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also gained over the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrency funds saw their first inflows in seven weeks as investors poured money into altcoins such as ether, cardano, and Solana last week, according to a report by digital-asset manager CoinShares.

Digital asset funds saw net inflows of $21 million last week. However, during the six-week period, the longest losing streak since January 2018, digital asset investment products saw total redemption of $115 million.

However, bitcoin saw its seventh straight week of outflows, as investors took out $2.8 million from funds based on the world’s biggest cryptocurrency during last week. Ether saw minor inflows totalling $3.2 million last week along with other altcoins such as cardano, litecoin and polkadot, which saw inflows of $6.4 million, $1.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Later, supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped the Bitcoin rally.

During the previous run-up, the TVL reaching an all-time high coincided with the surging prices of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), both of which reached their all-time highs around the same time.

This time around, Bitcoin and Ether are more than 24% below their all-time highs, yet the TVL in DeFi has surpassed its previous record.

This suggests that popular DeFi-related tokens with a multi-faceted utility within the crypto and DeFi ecosystem have attracted investors' attention. Typically, Uniswap (UNI) and SushiSwap (SUSHI) lead among DeFi tokens, but a few other strong gainers this week include a 22% increase for Convex Finance and a 17.84% increase from PancakeSwap.

New protocols attract attention

The past three months have also seen the arrival of popular new DeFi protocols like DinoSwap and the rise of Ethereum-network competitors, like Avalanche (AVAX), that have brought fresh energy and funds to the DeFi ecosystem.

The @DinoSwapHQ team is working hard everyday to continue expanding and providing the best farming experience. Onwards! pic.twitter.com/4h4hrSPKN4 — DinoSwap (@DinoSwapHQ) July 31, 2021

DinoSwap and Avalanche have benefited from users fleeing the high fees on the Ethereum network due to the reduced transaction costs and faster processing times through their cross-chain bridges.

Avalanche launched its ‘Avalanche Rush’ DeFi incentive program on Aug. 18, which has brought a flurry of activity to the protocols involved, including Aave, Curve and SushiSwap. This liquidity mining event has proven quite popular and has helped to lift its native AVAX token back above $50 for the first time since February.

In the first half of the year, DeFi tokens rallied early and were followed by a surge in the price of NFTs and NFT-related assets. As summer draws to a close and NFTs notch new eye-watering record sales and volumes each day, it's possible that a sector rotation could occur soon and the DeFi sector may be warming up for a run of its own.

2021-08-30,The Hill,Cryptocurrency makes the climate crisis worse,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/569395-cryptocurrency-makes-the-climate-crisis-worse,"Cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin in particular, is always in the news nowadays and is becoming a significant factor in modern financial markets. Unsurprisingly, the subject of regulating cryptocurrency in one form or another has become an important concern. China is already restricting its use. Central banks around the world are looking at decentralized cryptocurrencies to assess their potential impact on financial stability, or to even issue their own digital currencies. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler Gary GenslerOn The Money — The Democratic divide on taxes Coinbase says SEC investigating its crypto lending product Climate hawks pressure Biden to replace Fed chair MORE described crypto trading as the “Wild West” recently calling for Congress to create a protection regime for crypto investors. A major impasse for the critical infrastructure bill was the issue of taxing crypto transactions. Others have proposed that “stablecoins” be regulated like banks.

Unsurprisingly, the crypto industry has developed a formidable lobbying force to ward off further regulation. Regulation is totally antithetical to the very idea of decentralized cryptocurrency.

Yet, little focus has gone to the environmental dangers of cryptocurrency. Yes, Elon Musk Elon Reeve MuskElon Musk's SpaceX vs. the environmentalists Biden seeks to build Democratic support among unions Russia's space chief jealous of Musk and Bezos: 'Our millionaires prefer to invest more in yachts' MORE attracted the usual hype when he first announced that Tesla would accept Bitcoin — and then stated (rather belatedly given the science) that since he learned of the environmental damage inflicted by cryptocurrencies he would reverse that decision.

Cryptocurrency’s impact on the environment is indeed very serious — possibly the single most important policy factor against its growth.

Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum in particular, are so damaging to the environment that they threaten to reverse any gains achieved through the transition to electric vehicles and the reduction in fossil fuels use. Much of this consumption and output derives from the energy and processing intensive “mining” of Bitcoin and “proofs of work.” Even now the total Bitcoin carbon footprint exceeds the total emission reductions of electric vehicles. According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Bitcoin already consumes more energy than the whole of Argentina (pop. 45 million).

Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates that Bitcoin and Ethereum together consume the same amount of power as Ukraine and Israel, totaling 52 million people. The carbon footprint of a single Bitcoin transactions equates to nearly 2 million Visa transactions, or 135,229 hours of watching YouTube! A single Ethereum transaction consumes the equivalent power used by an average U.S. household over 4.55 days. Furthermore, the energy and carbon footprints of both these and other cryptocurrencies are projected to grow exponentially in volume as speculation, hype and criminality continue to drive volume. Already, total crypto energy consumption “is roughly comparable to the carbon emissions produced by the metropolitan area of London,” according to The Gaurdian.

Apart from these staggering energy consumption statistics, crypto is also intensifying competition for chips, for which there is already a global shortage impeding the manufacture of alternative energy devices, including EVs. Crypto has already grown exponentially. Further growth will only broaden its carbon footprint.

Given the daunting targets for carbon reduction that we face in the U.S. and globally, this development should concern everyone. If there were offsetting gains with crypto, one might justify it on a cost-benefit basis, as we do with EVs (which inflict some damage but less overall than combustion engines). Yet, there are no real gains.

There are many classes of crypto adventurers: libertarian idealists who dream of freedom from sovereign monetary control; hardware and software players “mining” the stuff for reward; traders who derive revenue from crypto transactions; speculators who ride the wild volatility of crypto; crypto “wallet” raiders; and criminals who exploit the relative degree of anonymity crypto offers as ransomware. Despite grand statements about reducing transaction costs and liberation from “fiat” money, none of the legitimate players have made a case for crypto contributions to general welfare. Beyond rhetoric they have not even seriously attempted to. Instead, they have relied on the naivete of lawmakers, regulators and journalists.

Well-informed commentators have described crypto as a “giant bubble.” Yet, regulators continue to display timidity in addressing the subject. While the Biden administration urges the auto industry to transition to 50 percent EVs by 2030, we recklessly allow crypto to escalate at huge current and potential cost to our carbon footprint.

China has at least taken one step in the direction of connecting crypto to climate change concerns: It has banned crypto mining. This activity will only move elsewhere. Legislators and policymakers should inform themselves now and act soon to stop the counterproductive growth of this industry, no matter how potent their lobbying forces have become. If they do not, even as the threat posed by global warming enters “code red” according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change we will find ourselves in yet another situation where an entrenched industry prevents us from advancing the common good and tackling climate change.

2021-08-30,Cointelegraph,Ethereum supply shock: Exchange ETH reserves continue to fall after a 26% drop in 2021,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-supply-shock-exchange-eth-reserves-continue-to-fall-after-a-26-drop-in-2021,"The amount of Ether (ETH) held by all cryptocurrency exchanges has declined dramatically in the previous 12 months.

Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant reported that Ethereum reserves on trading platforms dropped 26.29 million ETH to 19.22 million ETH year-on-year (YoY), indicating that traders' preference to hold their tokens increased.

At least the Ether price performance in the same period indicates the same. Between August 25, 2020, and press time, the ETH/USD exchange rate exploded by a little over 730%— from $407 to $3,190, signaling an erratic inverse correlation between the Ethereum token prices and its reserves across all exchanges.

In detail, traders typically prefer to keep their crypto assets on exchange wallets when they wish to trade them in the near term. Otherwise, they move those assets to private wallets to control their own keys, a strategy that stems from the fears of losing funds to hacks and similar security breaches at crypto exchanges.

Ether deposits plunge

Another on-chain indicator, built by CoinMetrics to track the total number of Ether deposits to exchanges, also alerted holding sentiment among Ethereum traders. It noted that traders' ETH deposits across all the trading platforms had plunged 21.11% YoY, from 413,772 ETH to 326,408.

But in the last 30 days, the ETH deposits have dropped dramatically by 47.81%, signaling that many investors are expecting higher prices in the long term.

Meanwhile, the sum count of unique addresses holding any amount of Ether in the last 30 days has jumped 1.67%, coinciding with a 42% ETH/USD rally in the same period. On a YoY timeframe, the unique address count has jumped 30.87%.

Supply Squeeze

The Ether holding sentiment has picked momentum in days leading up to and after a landmark Ethereum network upgrade on August 5, 2021. Dubbed as the London Hard Fork, the software update implemented a proposal called EIP-1559 that enabled gas fee burning on the Ethereum network.

This has added deflationary pressure as a result. In the first 20 days after EIP-1559 went live, the network has burned almost 92,595 ETH worth around $295.85 million, according to WatchTheBurn.com.

More Ether went out of active supply as Ethereum invited participants to deposit 32 ETH to become validator on its upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain. Beacon Chain reports that the so-called Ethereum 2.0 smart contract has attracted a little over 6.9 million ETH worth around $22 billion.

Additionally, demand for Ether continues to grow owing to Ethereum's expanding ecosystem, containing projects from the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible token sectors.

Last week, Lyn Alden, the founder Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, called the London upgrade a ""tactically bullish"" event, noting that it could easily push ETH/USD rates to over $5,000.

A man holding a phone walks past a sign of Chinese company ByteDance's app TikTok, known locally as Douyin, at the International Artificial Products Expo in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China October 18, 2019. Reuters

If Lucas Dimos gets one more video removed from TikTok, he suspects he'll get kicked off the platform forever. In the last month, at least 10 of his videos have been taken down for promoting illegal activities and regulated goods. But Dimos, who posts content on a TikTok account called theblockchainboy, says he hasn't done anything wrong. ""It's left my account on such a razor's edge,"" said Dimos. ""We're dying out here. We're floundering. We've tried to build a community and guide this whole movement in the right direction."" TikTok cryptocurrency content creators like Dimos, who claim they are just trying to educate consumers about the emerging market, say they have been hard hit by rapid changes at the social media company. In July, TikTok implemented a system that can automatically block videos violating its policies, and the company recently updated its branded content policy, barring the promotion of financial services including cryptocurrencies, unless users disclose it through a branded content option in the app. CNBC spoke with 11 cryptocurrency creators for this story who say they have posted educational crypto videos, yet their content is getting flagged or taken down permanently with little explanation from TikTok. Some said their accounts are also getting temporarily banned more frequently. Most of the influencers CNBC spoke with said they haven't been paid to promote any crypto content on TikTok in the last few weeks, and that video views and new followers have dwindled since July.

TikTok declined to comment on the reports from creators. Instead, a spokesperson pointed CNBC to the company's community guidelines page. The spokesperson would not specify which guidelines crypto creators were violating. When videos are pulled from TikTok, the creators say they get a notification that they violated community guidelines. Sometimes it notes that they posted content related to 'illegal activities and regulated goods.' The guidelines haven't been updated since December, though TikTok rolled out its new detection feature a little over a month ago, when creators say the takedowns ramped up. Some of the creators CNBC spoke with are considering shifting to platforms like Google-owned YouTube, Twitter, Facebook's Instagram and the chatting app Discord, where they say they have more freedom to share content. ""The real issue isn't the advertisements,"" said a cryptocurrency influencer who goes by Wendy O. ""It's the fact that TikTok is shadow banning and censoring crypto content creators and a lot of us are posting great educational pieces.""

Navigating unknown terrain

The creators CNBC spoke with say the recent updates are warranted to crackdown on spam accounts or fraudulent money-making schemes like ""rug pulls,"" where individuals entice users to buy into a crypto, prop up the price and pull out. But they say the system is overcompensating and affecting those who are just trying to educate their audiences about crypto. ""It was almost like a knee-jerk reaction from TikTok against all of these scams that were going on,"" said Dimos, who has over 314,000 followers on the platform. ""While they may have blocked the scam posts, all of us creators are unable to post any of our content."" In recent weeks, creators say they can't use words like ""Binance,"" ""decentralized finance,"" or specific coins like bitcoin or ethereum in a video without it getting removed. The consensus among creators is that those words alert the algorithm, leading to an automatic takedown or review. Chart analysis and forecasting also flag the system, according to creators like Timothy, who goes by cryptoweatherman on TikTok. Under its community guidelines, TikTok says it will remove content ""including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, and text"" in violation, and that it uses a ""mix of technology and human moderation"" to enforce its guidelines before content is even reported. If a video is removed, the user is typically notified that the post violates a community guideline or relates to ""illegal activities and regulated goods."" But the message doesn't offer specifics, the creators said. The creators CNBC spoke with said if they get two videos taken down, they are banned from posting content for at least 24 hours. Bans can last anywhere from a day to a week, the creators who CNBC spoke with said. TikTok's guidelines say that users are notified when content is removed and that they can appeal the takedown if they ""believe no violation has occurred."" The company also says it will suspend or ban accounts that are repeatedly ""involved in severe or repeated violations"" and that they take into account ""information available on other platforms and offline in these decisions."" When the creators reach out to TikTok about an account ban or pulled video, most say they have been ignored or sent an automated response. There's no phone number to call, no representative to email, yet, some creators say when they appeal the takedown TikTok reinstates many videos. Joshua Thillens, who goes by Joshua Jake on TikTok, says he's had at least eight videos taken down. When CNBC spoke with Mason Versluis, a creator with nearly 430,000 followers on an account called cryptomasun, he was experiencing a 48-hour ban, which prevented him from posting. Prior to the guideline change, Versluis had one video taken down showing a car crash. In the last few weeks, he said between 30 and 35 of his videos have been taken down. Most were reinstated after he submitted an appeal. ""I'm not claiming to be a financial wizard or a financial advisor or even a trader,"" Versluis said. ""I'm simply someone who's been in crypto for four years. I've studied this in-depth and the information I bring and the opinions should speak for themselves.""

Views and followers reach a bottleneck

Many creators also say views and followers have slowed in recent weeks and followers say the creators aren't showing up on their ""For You"" pages. TikTok's community guidelines say the company may limit a post's visibility in search results and other feeds. Mack Lorden, who has over 102,000 followers on TikTok, says he quickly built his following when he launched his platform in January. But he ""reached a bottleneck"" last month, a change he attributes to both the guideline change and the price drop in the crypto market. Smaller creators like Miguel Morales, who has a little over 5,200 followers on his account called blockchaincrusader, are also feeling the pinch. Morales says views have dropped on good videos from almost 100,000 to 10,000. On a good day, he's lucky to get over 1,000 views. Nick Dye, who has over 14,400 followers on his account called the_cryptokeeper, says he was getting 300 to 400 followers a day consistently within the first few months of launching his account and after posting a viral video. He said new followers went from hundreds to maybe three or six per day after the policy change. His first 12,000 followers he says he got in just 25 days. The last couple thousand has taken double the time. ""No one knows what they can and can't say,"" Dye said. ""It discourages the newer creators like myself that have the knowledge and experience that they can offer. We're scared to share things for fear of getting banned.""

Getting creative with crypto content

In the weeks since the changes, creators say they are getting creative with the content they post. Wendy O. recently posted a series of videos referring to cryptocurrencies as ketos. Dye calls ethereum his ""girlfriend."" Carla Nasui and Walker Van Dixhorn, who are known as The Crypto Couple, have always used comedy to discuss crypto, a setup they say has kept them from getting banned. Morales has cut back from making three videos a day to just two. Some creators CNBC spoke with have done sponsored content in the past and say they can make anywhere from $300 to $20,000, depending on their following. That payment is occasionally made in cryptocurrencies. Versluis has partnered with DAO Maker, a crowdfunding platform that also serves as a launchpad for some cryptos, and IOI, one of the cryptocurrencies launched through it. Wendy O. created content for a platform involved in crypto-lending called Celsius. Some also make money through paid Discord subscriptions and one-on-one investing sessions. But all of the creators CNBC interviewed said they make most of their content for fun or to educate the masses and they never explicitly tell users to buy into a coin.

The tech giant noted that the malicious apps were misleading users by making fake claims.

Users were reportedly lured to install the apps on their phones in hope of turning rich in a snap by using cloud mining services that the apps claimed to be offering. But in reality, it was nothing more than a scam, as not even a single app had any crypto mining operations.

However, once a user installed the malicious app, he or she were charged anywhere between $14.99 to $18.99 as an additional fee that was falsely said to be boosting the income of users. Some of the apps, with absolutely no mining features, falsely claimed that the additional fee will improve their mining abilities.

Complete list of apps banned by Google Play Store:



1. BitFunds – Crypto Cloud Mining

2. Bitcoin Miner – Cloud Mining

3. Bitcoin (BTC) – Pool Mining Cloud Wallet

4. Crypto Holic – Bitcoin Cloud Mining

5. Daily Bitcoin Rewards – Cloud Based Mining System

6. Bitcoin 2021

So what

Earlier this month, new Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler sparked a minor freakout among cryptocurrency investors when he linked cryptocurrency trading with ""fraud"" in an interview with Bloomberg, and urged Congress to establish a ""robust oversight regime"" for the cryptocurrency market. Today, the woman Gensler replaced as head of the SEC -- now-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen -- was quoted by The Washington Post echoing Gensler's concerns.

Cryptocurrency ""is often [used] for illicit finance,"" said Yellen, adding that ""it's an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions,"" a ""highly speculative asset"" -- oh, and ""the amount of energy that's consumed in processing those transactions is staggering,"" to boot!

To put the icing on the cake, Yellen has also apparently advocated creating a ""central bank digital currency"" to compete with Bitcoin and other independently developed cryptocurrencies -- an idea China has also floated.

Now what

Add it all up, and the Post observes that a lot of cryptocurrency fans now fear that ""Yellen wants to annihilate the industry"" -- perhaps to make way for a national digital currency of the government's own making. Personally, I think that sounds a bit ambitious, and I'm not convinced the government could pull it off even if it wanted to. Still, when combined with previous comments from elsewhere in government -- specifically, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank president Neel Kashkari's accusation that non-governmental cryptocurrencies are ""95% fraud, hype, noise and confusion"" -- there's mounting evidence that momentum is building for some serious regulatory efforts to rein in cryptocurrency trading in the U.S.

Until we get a better idea of what, specifically, the government plans to do, I'd buckle up for more volatility in the crypto market in the weeks ahead.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640657/bitcoin-symbol-pinned-to-a-dartboard.jpg',)",none

1) Centralised exchanges (CEX) -

2) Decentralised Exchanges

Limitations:

NEW DELHI: The quintessentially decentralised nature of cryptocurrency compared to a well regulated stock exchange is a major incentive for investors: they can operate free of regulatory norms that is the hallmark of stock exchanges.But is crypto trading always decentralised ? How do they work? We zoom in on some of the key features of crypto exchanges.A cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform where people exchange their fiat money (government-issued currency) into cryptocurrencies and vice versa.Depending on the customer's ease, competitive pricing and government regulation, cryptocurrency exchanges can be of three types :Centralised exchanges are the most highly accepted and used form in the world.Recently, demands of institutional investors for a centrally cleared and secure environment for trading led Eurex, an international exchange, to launch its first regulated Bitcoin derivatives market in Europe.Centralised exchanges are fully regulated and controlled by a central authority, as the name suggests. A centralised exchange is just like the stock exchange. They are governed by a company that offers crypto trading for fiat to crypto or crypto to crypto.* In CEX, the exchange acts as an intermediary or investor’s custodian, which holds the investors' money like a bank.* The trading in CEXs is done on the exchange’s database, like Coinbase or Binance ’s database, so they are more susceptible to cyber attacks.* CEXs don't give private keys to access wallets and require KYC regulations and verification.* They have high liquidity and enable faster transactions.* Some CEXs that offer fiat/crypto pairings are Coinbase, Bitterex and Kraken.* Some CEXs that offer crypto/crypto pairings are Binance, Huobi and KuCoin.or DEXs, on the other hand, are a peer-to-peer marketplace that directly connects buyers and sellers or the investors for carrying out transactions without any intermediary.DEXs work on the core principle that cryptocurrencies were designed for: no controls and regulations from the authorities.Here, the trading is done on blockchain which offers some advantages:* They can't be hacked or shut down by the government easily.* Provide investors security, transparency and greater control over trading and allow privacy to the users.* They have an automated process that controls all the transactions and doesn’t depend on a company to control the assets of an investor.Due to their limited functionality and absence of government controls, they are less popular and thus have lower trading volumes, lower liquidity and slower transactions.* Due to the absence of regulation, the funds sent to a wrong wallet cannot be cancelled or retrieved.They only offer crypto-to-crypto trading.* IDEX is the most-user friendly decentralised exchange for trading Ethereum tokens and Waves DEX is another one for trading Bitcoin and Litecoin.3) The third category is the Hybrid Exchange . This is said to be the next generation crypto trading marketplace as it bridges the limitation of both forms of exchanges by merging the privacy and security of DEXs and high liquidity, fast transaction and regulated framework of CEXs.Some of the benefits of hybrid exchanges are :* They incorporate solutions on blockchain technology.* Investors’ funds are stored in cold wallets, making them less prone to cyber thefts.* They provide real time access and ensure compliance to digital laws.* They allow users custody of their funds even if a third party is involved in the trading.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85625306,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-238610,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

(Photo: AP)

Some Afghans are relying on their cryptocurrency holdings amid the economic crisis triggered by the Taliban’s hostile takeover. Crypto assets won’t help citizens purchase anything immediately, but are a guarantee that their wealth will be safe amid economic instability.

Investing in cryptocurrencies is a fairly new concept in Afghanistan, but the country has seen rapid adoption of digital coins in 2021. The country ranked 20th out of 154 countries in the Chainalysis 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index — a huge improvement from 2020 when it did not even make the list. And upon isolating the country's peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, Afghanistan jumps up to 7th place, as per the report.

Read | How Afghanistan changed economically, and socially, after US invasion

The data suggests that more Afghans started investing in cryptocurrencies this year, probably fearing an economic crisis as the Taliban began its quest to take control of the country.

Explained: The good, bad and ugly of investing in cryptocurrencies

In fact, Google Trends data revealed web searches in Afghanistan for ‘bitcoin’ and ‘crypto’ spiked in July, just weeks before the Taliban coup in Kabul. However, there is no way to determine the exact number of searches as the tool only calculates the measure of interest and does not record actual figures.

While digital coin adoption has increased in the country, there is no way to determine how many people of the total population have actually invested in cryptocurrencies.

AFGHANS WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY HOLDINGS

A 22-year-old Afghan with crypto holdings spoke to CNBC.com and said he has been keeping a close watch on his portfolio on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Farhan Hotak is among the few Afghans who will be protected from the currency onslaught triggered as a result of the Taliban’s takeover. Others like Hotak, who have invested in cryptos, will also be safe from the rapid currency depreciation. It may be noted that Afghanistan’s currency afghani plummeted sharply after the Taliban took control of the country.

Hotak said the scope of investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is very limited in Afghanistan. “I have very, very, very limited resources to do anything. I’m interested in the crypto world, because I have earned a lot, and I see a lot of potential in myself that I can go further,” he told CNBC.com.

Musa Ramin, 27, is another Afghan national who had invested a portion of his net worth into cryptocurrencies days before the Taliban entered Kabul.

Ramin first invested in cryptocurrencies after he lost money due to rapidly depreciating currency. In 2020, he got stuck in Turkey for six months due to the Covid-19 lockdown. He converted all his money to the lira, the Turkish currency. He encountered deep losses after the currency spiralled due to the Covid-induced global economic downturn. “That is when I discovered bitcoin,” he said.

At first, he lost a lot of money but has got a hang of managing digital assets, thanks to Twitter and YouTube tutorials. He still has significant crypto holdings and believes that it is the safest place to park his cash during economic volatility.

While cryptocurrency adoption has witnessed growth in Afghanistan, it is far from levels witnessed in other countries where digital assets have gained popularity. Electricity issues, bad internet, low banking and lack of awareness are some of the basic problems that have hindered large-scale crypto adoption in Afghanistan.

NEW DELHI: The Bitcoin whales are back. ‘Whales’ are those individuals that hold large amounts of bitcoin.Data from Blockchain firm Chainalysis shows that accounts holding bitcoin estimated at over $50 million have continued to buy the cryptocurrency since June end.Between late June and until recently, investors have acquired digital assets close to $10 billion which is somewhat closer to what whales held in February 2021, revealed data from Chainalysis. Bitcoin value started climbing steadily in the beginning of July, hit a new high by the end of the month and the run continued till the first fortnight of August.However, analysts are still very curious to know how and why the price surge is fuelling the buying and not the selling. Could this be the advent of a boom? This is what has caught their imagination.Large investors in Bitcoin who are piloting the pole position are also driving the market to its logical levels.The Bitcoin stacked up at the investors has been assigned to medium level changes happening in the crypto market. The whale activity is being linked to the oncoming surprises or trends. This trend was seen even at the end of February when the prices shot up with whales including Elon Musk, investing in a big way.However, the buoyancy was short-lived and soon the prices fell, but those who had invested in the low-pressure regime made money. According to data from Chainalysis, whale activity had fluctuated based on the volatility of the crypto assets. This was seen evidently in March 2021.The large Bitcoin holders (whales) are likely to hold on to their crypto assets for a longer period. Almost 75 percent of crypto assets are retained by them in every cycle of ups and downs.The value of the entire cryptocurrency market crossed $2.2 trillion which was the second time in a period of 45 days.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85624543,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-80970,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Technology developments and cyberattacks are an inevitable duo, and the latest battle is between cryptocurrency and hackers. As everyone is getting on the cryptocurrency wave, some malicious apps have to come to light that is misleading users.

Google has identified eight such apps on the Play Store and indefinitely banned them. These apps are intended to lure innocent users into installing them on their phones. These apps use the “get rich quick” scheme to attract users into investing money in a “cloud mining service” and repeating profits.

None of those apps are associated with cloud mining operations or have any cryptocurrency mining features. Instead, they charge in-app purchases from users as high as US$14.99 to US$18.99. Despite having no mining features, these apps falsely convince users that they can maximize the mining abilities with an additional fee.

The eight apps banned by Google are:

BitFunds – Crypto Cloud Mining

Bitcoin Miner – Cloud Mining

Bitcoin (BTC) – Pool Mining Cloud Wallet

Crypto Holic – Bitcoin Cloud Mining

Daily Bitcoin Rewards – Cloud Based Mining System

Bitcoin 2021

MineBit Pro – Crypto Cloud Mining & BTC miner

Ethereum (ETH) – Pool Mining Cloud

While there are already speculations about the long-term survival of cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment and currency option, such apps advocate for the case of increased fraudulent activities. Those who are apprehensive about cryptocurrencies have another reason to stay against them. The prolonged existence of such apps will damage the reputation of the cryptocurrency market.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-Cryptocurrency-Apps-Have-Been-Banned-by-Google-for-Fraud.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Forbes,"Bitcoin And Ethereum Losses Headline $125 Billion Cryptocurrency Market Tumble, While NFT Sector Breaks New Records",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/08/25/bitcoin-and-ethereum-losses-headline-125-billion-cryptocurrency-market-tumble-while-nft-sector-breaks-new-records/,"Cryptocurrency prices according to COIN360 COIN360

The global cryptocurrency market endured a $125 billion pullback over the past 24 hours, losing 6.21% of its market capitalization as of the early morning.

The decline is led by bitcoin, which has shed 4.63% and is trading near $47,330 at 5:33 a.m. ET. The top cryptocurrency had briefly climbed above $50,000 for the first time since May following a stream of positive news, including cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announcing a $500 million crypto purchase program and United Wholesale Mortgage, second largest mortgage lender in the U.S., starting to accept bitcoin for payment.

Despite the surge, some analysts stayed cautious. “Medium-term U.S. and China regulatory headwinds remain,” noted Jehan Chu, founder and managing partner of Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, in a message to Forbes. “The world's largest exchange Binance remains under heavy enforcement pressure, and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's ominous comments on regulating DeFi could cut the legs out of any sustained rally. Expect the near-term pump to find sub-$30,000 BTC prices if broader U.S. economic sentiment suddenly turns south,” Chu warned.

Adding to the pressure is the inflow of coins to cryptocurrency exchanges, which means investors could be preparing to sell. 22,803 BTC, or over $1 billion, moved onto exchanges since Friday, according to William Clemente, lead insights analyst of Blockware Solutions.

Second largest cryptocurrency, ether, is also in retraction mode, having declined 6.7% over the past 24 hours to $3,123. Altcoins are following the trend, with XRP, Polkadot and Solana bearing the largest losses among the top 10 in the 9-11% range.

In contrast to cryptocurrencies, the market for non-fungible tokens is hitting new peaks. With the news of payments giant Visa buying its first NFT for $150,000, NFTs have caught on a new wave. Trading volume of NFT collection CryptoPunks, one of which Visa has famously bought, is up by 430% this week, according to DappRadar. One of these algorithmically generated characters sold for $5.33 million overnight. Leading collectibles marketplace OpenSea has set multiple daily records this month, reaching a new high of $209 million in trading volume yesterday, according to data from Dune Analytics.

(Photo: Reuters)

Cryptocurrency adoption has rapidly gained momentum in India despite uncertainty around the future of the unregulated digital asset. Investments in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, has registered a breathtaking rise in India since 2020.

Data from several domestic cryptocurrency exchanges suggest that millions of retail investors have signed up on their portals to invest in cryptocurrencies — an asset class known for notorious volatility and potential to deliver high returns.

At least 1.5 crore Indians have invested in cryptocurrencies, signalling strong cryptocurrency growth in a nation where households are known to invest more frequently in gold and other safer assets. The growing number of crypto adopters also suggests a shift in the investment paradigm, driven mostly by the country's younger population.

Explained: The good, bad and ugly of investing in cryptocurrencies

WHY MORE INDIANS ARE SHIFTING TO CRYPTOCURRENCIES?

More Indians started investing in cryptocurrencies from 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic led to a global economic crisis, resulting in higher volatility and depreciation in traditional assets like currencies, bonds and equities. As a result, more people around the globe started investing in cryptocurrencies.

This resulted in a sharp rise in crypto valuations throughout 2020, led by popular virtual coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

In India, cryptocurrency investments grew from approximately $923 million in April 2020 to a whopping $6.6 billion in May 2021. India ranks 11th out of 154 nations in terms of cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report prepared by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

While investments in gold are considered as an ideal hedge in times of economic downturn, more young Indians seem to have changed their appetite. As the situation stands, digital coin investments form a faction of bullion market holdings but younger Indians — between the age group of 18 and 35 years — find cryptocurrency a better option compared to gold.

The latest World Gold Council data also show that Indian adults, aged 34 or less, have a lower appetite for gold. A number of cryptocurrency experts said the tech-savvy younger population find it easier to invest in cryptocurrency than gold due to the processes involved.

WILL MORE INDIANS JOIN THE CRYPTO RACE?

Many Indians want to invest in cryptocurrencies but are worried about the asset’s uncertain future in the country. But data from domestic cryptocurrency exchanges indicate healthy growth in the number of investors.

Popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the country including WazirX, ZebPay, Unocoin and CoinDCX have seen massive growth in retail investors on their platform since 2020. They have recently seen a sharp rise in investors, days before Bitcoin’s value crossed $50,000 after a period of three months.

It may be noted that cryptocurrencies hit a rough patch earlier this year when China started a regulatory crackdown on virtual coins. The negative momentum dented the crypto market for months, following which virtual coins have recovered again.

Experts tracking the sector and founders of cryptocurrency exchanges believe that rapid fintech advancements and greater adoption will lead to a rise in the number of Indians investing in cryptocurrencies in the near future.

In fact, some of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges have invested in India due to growing virtual coin trade volumes and the rising number of retail participants. While there is uncertainty over the cryptocurrency ecosystem in India, global coin exchanges have found it hard to ignore the potential for growth in a country of 1.3 billion people.

Domestic exchanges are confident that more investors will join the cryptocurrency race in India after Bitcoin’s recent advance. After Bitcoin crossed $50,000 on Monday, cryptocurrency exchanges have seen a jump in their trading volumes and the value of investments.

The recent surge in the cryptocurrency market has not only led to a jump in new investors but also rekindled interest among old traders. Many analysts feel that the recent jump in virtual coin prices is linked to the rise in global cryptocurrency adoption.

LOOKING BEYOND BITCOIN

Experts tracking the cryptocurrencies have observed another positive trend: There is less panic among investors during sudden market dips and high volatility.

Many cryptocurrency exchange owners feel that investors have developed a greater understanding of the virtual coin market, leading to sustained trading rather than just plain buying.

Investors have realised that investing in smaller cryptocurrencies could reap as much profit as Bitcoin or Ether. As Indian investors dive deeper into the world of cryptocurrencies, they have started looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ether, which are expensive compared to altcoins — a term given other popular cryptocurrencies in the virtual coin ecosystem.

FACTBOX — CRYPTOCURRENCY ADOPTION IN INDIA At least 1.5 crore Indians hold cryptocurrencies assets Cryptocurrency investments have grown rapidly in India to $6.6 billion as of May 2021 Indians aged between 18-35 years are primarily driving cryptocurrency investments in the country India ranks 11th out of 154 nations in terms of cryptocurrency adoption Cryptocurrency exchanges feel more Indians want to invest in digital coins but are worried about the future Global cryptocurrency exchanges have invested heavily in India despite uncertainties

Instead of buying expensive cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ether, investors are also putting their money on lower-priced virtual coins such as XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Polkadot, Chainlink, Solana, UniSwap and more.

As mentioned earlier, calculated investments in altcoins could lead to massive gains as well. For instance, Cardano witnessed a sharp surge in valuation over the past few weeks. Therefore, any investment in Cardano over the past week could have led to healthy gains.

There is a notion, however, that Bitcoin’s value is still a driving factor behind the movements of altcoins. While this is true to some extent, there are days when altcoins outperform market leaders like Bitcoin and Ether. This is similar to when stock market madcaps and small caps outperform benchmarks like Sensex and Nifty.

ALL EYES ON THE GOVERNMENT'S CRYPTO BILL

Cryptocurrency trade has witnessed a boom in India over the past couple of years and there is scope for better growth, but there is one major hurdle. Regulatory uncertainty remains at large as the government is yet to come out with its cryptocurrency bill.

All eyes remain on the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which will determine the future of virtual coin trade in the country. The bill is currently awaiting approval from the Union Cabinet, following which it will be introduced in parliament.

While the government had earlier said it would enforce a ban on private cryptocurrencies, there has been a change in its stance, with officials hinting that trading activities could be regulated — a scenario favoured by all major cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country.

Many cryptocurrency exchanges believe that the early adoption of digital coin trade will help India gain an advantage in the rapidly growing global cryptocurrency ecosystem. They also believe that more people will start investing in cryptocurrencies once the government provides some clarity on the subject.","('https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202108/Cryptocurrency_demand_decoded-647x363.png?2E1Rmheloc6oUMCOpIL.mxJiA8dKXWPx',)",none
2021-08-23,News.com.au,Cardano tipped to replace Ethereum as second-largest cryptocurrency,https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/wealth/cardano-tipped-to-overtake-ethereum-as-secondlargest-cryptocurrency/news-story/a5734e7883b9e1781e8b9988cb575d17,"A mostly unknown cryptocurrency is on the right track to take out the number two position and potentially even kick bitcoin out of its prime spot.

A cryptocurrency which seemingly came out of nowhere is on the right track to take out the number two position and potentially even kick bitcoin out of its prime spot.

Confidence is building around cardano, a blockchain invented in 2015, after it overtook binance to come third on the crypto ladder, behind bitcoin and ethereum.

Experts think the coin has set its sights on surpassing ethereum next.

Last week, cardano (known as ADA in the crypto market) surged to a market capitalisation of $111.23 billion, officially overtaking binance which stood at $99.38 billion.

According to cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko, cardano has continued to skyrocket in the past week, rising by 35 per cent to $123.36 billion at time of writing.

Over the past 30 days, the coin has risen to nearly 187 per cent.

It’s believed cardano’s new-found popularity is from of the announcement of a major upgrade to the network called the Alonzo hard fork.

The coin’s more environmentally-friendly processing abilities, and its debut on the Japanese market, are also adding to the fervour.

Cardano is currently selling for $3.85.

Although that’s significantly less than its rival ethereum, which is sitting on $4429.23 per coin, experts have predicted that major gains are on the horizon.

Independent crypto analyst and YouTuber Lark Davis said that if cardano quadruples its value, which is possible given its current gains, it would hit the same market cap as ethereum.

And if it rose by 10 times, then it would have be neck and neck with the largest ever cryptocurrency, bitcoin.

An expert’s prediction on crypto.

What is Cardano?

Perhaps it’s not surprising that cardano is posing a very real threat to ethereum, considering that it was founded by someone who also created the ether token.

Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson created cardano in 2015 and launched it in 2017.

The coin is known as ADA on the crypto market, which is an homage to Augusta “Ada” King, or Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century British countess largely regarded as the first computer programmer.

She was also the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron.

Cardano has just hit the Japanese market.

What is the Alonzo hard fork update?

Last week, cardano announced the Alonzo hard fork which caused interest in the coin to hit an all-time high.

The upgrade allows for smart contracts to happen, which are pieces of computer code that can automatically execute when the right parameters are set.

That means once the Alonzo update is complete, anyone can make their own smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain, paving the way for native decentralised applications (dapps), according to CoinDesk.

Decentralised applications allows people to borrow, lend and trade with each other instantly, without any interference from a third party such as waiting on a bank to make the transaction.

The Alonzo hard fork is the third major update in cardano’s current stage.

The token has five main stages of development, also called “eras” which aim to expand the network and make it run as smoothly as possible.

They are named after famous writers from the Romantic movement of the 1800s: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, Voltaire.

Alonzo is the last major update for the Shelley era and moves the platform towards the Goguen era.

The Alonzo update is expected to begin sometime during the third quarter of this year.

Other reasons for the price spike

Another reason for cardano’s surge is that from Wednesday, the coin will be listed on Japan’s exchange.

Japan’s criteria to enter the market is considered one of the strictest in the world, which is another win for cardano.

Bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin are also on the Japanese market.

Cardano is also hugely popular because its proof of stake blockchain model is considered much more environmentally-friendly than any other mainstream cryptocurrency.

Proof of stake works means coins are randomly allocated to users, cutting down the energy needed for a transaction.

In contrast, bitcoin and ethereum use a proof of work mechanism which sees a global network of computers running simultaneously to facilitate a transaction.

Such a method requires an enormous amount of energy, with Bitcoinenergyconsumption.com estimating that bitcoin generated over 57 million tonnes of CO2 in a year – the same carbon footprint as a small European country.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a751d69b6c9ba78ad577b5b2334101e8',)",none

A little-known digital token tied to the Cardano blockchain has just surpassed other top alt-coins to become the third-largest virtual currency worldwide, as network developers aim to capitalise on the surge in decentralised finance that has swept the world.Currently, the popular alt-coin traded on cryptocurrency exchanges like CoinSwitch Kuber , Cardano's native coin, ADA, defied a major price crash warning to rise to an all-time high, surpassing the previous record. For the very first time on Friday, the ADA/USD rate of exchange surpassed $2.56, marking the culmination of a 154.54% price increase that began on July 20. This was achieved despite renowned trader Peter Brandt's warning of a price fall, which was predicated on a typical bearish pattern known as the head and shoulders pattern.With the price of the ADA coin soaring by about 50% in only the past week, there is growing confidence that new technological advancements will enable payment systems on Cardano earlier than the previously declared date of September 12. This will allow its network to provide profitable services like DeFi, where Ethereum presently holds a dominant position.In anticipation of the planned “Alonzo” upgrade, which is scheduled to be released on September 12, ADA investors are continuing to drive the value of Cardano higher. The Alonzo upgrade will bring smart-contract* functionality to the blockchain, allowing Cardano to establish itself as a legitimate player in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space.ADA is among the most highly sought-after cryptocurrencies for new traders due to its still-relatively low price and excellent marketing as one of the potential ""Ethereum killers."" There is little reason to suspect that Cardano is a favourite of the crypto world, and ADA is among the most highly sought-after cryptocurrencies for new traders due to its still-relatively low price and a promising future.With Cardano's ability to handle smart contracts—self-executing agreements among buyers and sellers—the token has gained consistently while Ethereum, Cardano’s core competitor, continues to dominate the growing $100 billion decentralised finance sector.Recently, the Solana blockchain ecosystem began to take shape with DeFi and NFTs, but despite the fact that Cardano has no actual use cases as of yet, the cryptocurrency's market capitalization is about 4x the size of Sol's market capitalization of $20 billion. Cardano has practically risen from the ashes on the backs of speculators and the promise of a fantastic and extremely transparent development team.Smart contracts, also known as blockchain contracts, are distinguished by the method in which they assure conformity between the two parties involved in the transaction. The immutability of a self-executing contract is one of the most notable characteristics of this type of contract. It implies that once codes, regulations, and even transactions have been written into the blockchain, it is hard to reverse, alter, change, or tamper with them.Smart contracts, similar to the traditional ones, are contracts between two or more parties that do not require the participation of a third party to monitor or enforce the agreement.As part of its operation, the blockchain network preserves a transaction record that is visible, secure, and unchangeable, ensuring that evidence of ownership is established and transferred. Contract discussion and application are made considerably more accessible, and the whole edit record of the deal is made publicly visible to all parties involved.When people use decentralised finance, also known as DeFi, they are transferring financial functions directly onto digital ledgers, allowing them to perform things such as, lend or borrow cash and collect interest in a savings-like account, all without the need for traditional middlemen such as banks. Its growing prevalence is part of a broader trend of rising blockchain usage, which is becoming more widespread.A series of recent rises in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, ADA, and other tokens pushed the cryptocurrency market to surpass $2 trillion in value this weekend, a first since the mid-May crash.With a gain of 1,300% in only one year, ADA is among the top-five best-performing cryptocurrencies, outpacing gains of 1,030% for Binance Coin, 330% for Ether, and 59% for Bitcoin, among other cryptocurrencies. The token, on the other hand, is extremely vulnerable to the enormous volatility of the larger cryptocurrency market.As a result of RBI’s crypto crackdown in 2018, the value of ADA plummeted by roughly 90%, ushering in a years-long bear market for the young sector. However, with the emergence of popular crypto exchanges in India, investments in crypto assets jumped from $200 million in 2019 to $40 billion in 2020. As of today, CoinSwitch Kuber , India’s leading crypto exchange has over 9 million registered users invested in crypto.All eyes will now be on the September 12 “Alonzo” upgrade and how it will tie back to ADA’s current positive run. If things go well, ADA could be seen as a primary competitor to Ethereum, ushering yet another era in the cryptocurrency sector.The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.

2021-08-23,Analytics Insight,6 Strategies to Make Money With Cryptocurrency,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/6-strategies-to-make-money-with-cryptocurrency/,"6 Strategies to Make Money With Cryptocurrency

Let’s unveil smart methods to make profits in the cryptocurrency market.

So, you have heard stories about cryptocurrency millionaires and want to try your hand at it? Originally, cryptocurrency was intended to become a global model of payment but currently, people are investing in cryptocurrencies to make money. This is not as easy as it sounds. A lot of people end up losing money or giving up halfway due to a lack of understanding.

The cryptocurrency industry is still in its early stages and crypto-assets are subject to massive market volatility. When the prices increase, investors are attracted to the industry and with market crashes, they incur heavy losses. But there are certain strategies that experienced investors use to make money with cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency trading is the most popular method to make money but there is a lot of volatility which makes it highly risky. But owing to the market’s immense growth potential, there are other effective strategies to make profits with cryptocurrency.

1. Investing

Investing in cryptocurrencies for the long term is an ideal strategy. Several popular cryptocurrencies are well suited to a buy-and-hold strategy. Coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are volatile for short periods but profitable in the long term.

2. Trading

Trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market is tough but not impossible. To be a successful trader, you should have analytical and technical skills. You will have to analyze technical charts on the performance to make accurate predictions about the price increase and decrease. While trading you can either take a long position or a short position, according to your prediction of rising or fall. This way, you can make profits regardless of whether the market is bearish or bullish.

3. Staking and Lending

Staking is a way of owning cryptocurrency but not spending them. By validating cryptocurrency transactions, you receive rewards in the form of crypto coins. These coins will be locked in the crypto wallet. A Proof-of-stake blockchain network that is used by many cryptocurrencies is ideal for this method. The reward you receive to verify transactions is similar to the interest a bank would pay for a credit balance.

4. Social Media

Since 2011, several blockchain startups have been launched to leverage the new technology. These startups have social media platforms and many of those companies reward people for creating and curating content for them with the native crypto coin of that platform.

5. Mining

Cryptocurrency mining is a crucial component of the proof of work mechanism. If you mind a cryptocurrency, you are rewarded with the new coins. Mining requires technical expertise and computing investment. You need to have a coding background and massively powerful computers in cold environments.

6. Airdrops

Airdrops are free tokens are distributed to raise awareness. Usually done by crypto exchanges, airdrops are done to create a larger user base for a project. With tokens received through airdrops, you can buy more cryptocurrencies and trade with them.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Strategies-to-Make-Money-With-Cryptocurrency.jpg',)",none

The entire cryptocurrency market capitalisation has dropped by 4 per cent in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin, which had crossed $50,000 for the first time since May on Monday, retreated yesterday due to profit-booking by investors, according to a Reuters news report quoting Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.

It may be noted that Bitcoin has gained 82 per cent since hitting a yearly low of $27,700 in January. As of 11:20 am, Bitcoin was trading at $48,372.89, down 2.39 per cent. The popular cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation has dipped to $912.19 billion, signalling weakness in the market.

Ether’s valuation fell to $3,212, down nearly 4 per cent. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation dipped to $376 billion. All other altcoins including XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Stellar, Polkadot, Uniswap, Chainlink and Litecoin saw a sharp fall in valuation.

Commenting on the weakness in the virtual coin market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “Bitcoin seems to be facing strong resistance at the current price. Since its drop below $50,000, the bears have been in a dominating position.”

“The nearest strong support is at $46,750. The selloff across most Altcoins was much higher. Over the past 24 hours, we witnessed the entire market cap drop by almost 4%, with traded volumes going up,” he added.

""It indicates the bearish momentum prevailing in the markets currently.”

The cryptocurrency was trading in the red after hitting a high of above $50,000, which was not seen since May of 2021. Bitcoin was trading at $48,210.85, which was witnessing a trend of 2.12 per cent down over the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap.com. Over the course of the last seven days, however, the coin had been trading at 7.88 per cent up with a market cap of $904.90 billion. Bitcoin had maintained a market dominance of 43.71 per cent with an increase of 0.36 per cent over the course of the day according to the crypto listing website.

Speaking on the recent developments of Bitcoin in the market, Edul Patel, the CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex said, “The past 24 hours were a major profit booking session. We witnessed a selloff across the entire crypto spectrum. Over the past couple of days, Bitcoin consolidated around the $50,000 mark. Bears found the perfect opportunity to bring the markets down after the bulls cooled off, and several investors booked profits. We witnessed a bigger dip across the Altcoins after days of intense rallying. The coming 24 hours could continue to be another bearish session.""

Other major altcoins like Ethereum were trading at $3,202.19 or 3.14 per cent lower at the time of this article. It was trading up at 6.13 per cent over the last week. The market cap for Ether stood at $374.76 billion. The third spot was occupied by Cardano, which was clocking in at $2.78 with a downward trend of 2.94 per cent over the past 24 hours. However, the coin saw an upward trend of 42.56 per cent over the past 7 days. Binance Coin stood at $482.30 as it was trading at 2.93 per cent down over the past 24 hours.

Speaking on the performance of Ether, Siddharth Menon, the COO WazirX said, “Ether continues to maintain its strength against Bitcoin leading the pact of Altcoins. Currently, 7 per cent of total ETH supply is staked for ETH 2.0, this shows the markets are really optimistic about Ether which is a strong indication of a bull run in Altcoins.”

He went on to add, “Projects like Cardano, Binance smartchain and Solana solving one of the critical problems of scaling through smart contracts shows tremendous strength against Bitcoin. One has to factor in the volatility of Altcoins before investing in them.”

The global crypto market cap stood at $2.07 trillion with a downward trend of 3.18 per cent over the last day. The total market volume over the last 24 hours was $117.63 billion which indicated an increase of 0.91 per cent.

“The overall crypto market looks strong as it trades above the 9-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average). The reversal was seen from 20th July 2021 and since then the crypto markets has been taking support on 9-day EMA and successfully trading above it. The chart seems to be forming the right side of the cup pattern, generally this pattern is seen in bull markets during consolidation phase. Once it breaks the previous ATH (All time high) of $2.57 trillion, the crypto markets will go in price discovery mode,” said Menon, while talking about the performance of the overall market.

2021-08-23,NDTV.com,The World Of Cryptocurrency Wallets And Exchanges: A Deep Dive,https://www.ndtv.com/business/cryptocurrency-wallets-and-exchanges-how-do-they-work-2516904,"A cryptocurrency exchange is a platform that helps a user to buy and sell tokens

If the discourse around and about cryptocurrency has encouraged you to venture into the market of digital tokens, it's important that you understand the various components of it. And before you take a deep dive into this ecosystem, make sure you know enough about what makes the world of digital tokens function, where they are stored, and how safe they are. And when we speak of storing cryptocurrency, two significant but different components come to mind. Cryptocurrency wallets and cryptocurrency exchange.

Cryptocurrency wallets

Just as you don't always carry your cash in hand and instead store it in your wallet, a cryptocurrency wallet is similar in many ways. It stores your digital tokens and keeps them safe just as your bank keeps your savings safe. Besides, a crypto wallet also facilitates sending and receiving digital currencies. Since cryptocurrencies are not tangible or in a physical form, these wallets store them and a user or owner of the wallet can make use of them as per his need.

There is another significant aspect of your crypto wallet and they are the keys. Your wallet has private and public keys that help you control as well as make your wallet function. The private keys help you sign a transaction, meaning they are similar to passwords when it comes to spending your digital tokens. And that's why you have to ensure they remain safe. If anyone gets access to your private keys, you might lose all your balance.

The public keys, on the other hand, act similar to your username on a payment app and help you receive crypto tokens from other users.

Cryptocurrency exchanges

As the name itself suggests, a cryptocurrency exchange is a platform that helps a user to buy and sell tokens. The exchange can be accessed on the internet as well as through an app. Not only does it facilitate buying and selling crypto tokens but also allows you to convert your money in fiat currency into digital tokens of your liking. The major difference between a wallet and an exchange is that the purpose of the former is primarily storage while the latter facilitates transactions as well as the conversion of currency into cash and vice-versa.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/jnqec5do_cryptocurrency_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Mint,"Cryptocurrency prices today fall. Check latest rates of Bitcoin, ether, dogecoin, other cryptos",https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-prices-today-fall-check-latest-rates-of-bitcoin-ether-dogecoin-other-cryptos-11629858322093.html,"In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin prices today were trading below $49,000 mark. The world's largest crypto broke above $50,000 level on Monday for the first time since mid-May as crypto prices continued an ongoing recovery from a disorderly rout just three months ago. Bitcoin is up 65% this year, though, far away from its record just below $65,000 in April.

As per CoinDesk, Bitcoin prices fell to $48,230, down nearly 2%. Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, plunged to $3,211, down over 2.5%. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was trading with cuts of 6% at $0.29. Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also declined in the range of 3-7% over the past 24 hours.

A consortium including Coinbase Global Inc. said all the reserves of the second-largest cryptocurrency stable coin will shift into cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries, forgoing riskier investments, reported Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, US crypto exchange Coinbase last week received its board’s approval to buy over $500 million of crypto. Moreover, 10% of the firm’s quarterly net income from now on will go into crypto assets.

Bitcoin enjoyed a blistering run earlier this year but in mid-May it began tumbling on a range of issues, including China's crackdown on cryptocurrencies and Tesla boss Elon Musk's decision to stop accepting it on concerns about the environmental impact of mining.

Market sentiment benefited as PayPal Holdings Inc will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week. The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class.

2021-08-23,Deseret News,What might happen to Shiba Inu coin this winter,https://www.deseret.com/2021/8/24/22639330/shib-coin-shiba-inu-coin-winter-2021-predictions,"Shiba Inu coin might be headed for a dark winter, especially if there isn’t any more social media hype that draws up massive support.

Shiba Inu coin predictions for the winter

Expert Liam Andrew Wright, a writer for crypto news site Benzinga, doesn’t see a great winter ahead for some cryptocurrencies, like Safemoon, Doge and Shiba Inu coin since they rely on social media hype and mentions from prominent figures, like Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

“I am not saying that Doge, Safemoon, or Shiba Inu are baseless projects without any strong fundamentals,” he wrote. “I am saying that these projects have risen due to social media hype and community momentum rather than their fundamentals. The fundamentals of the project are only discussed in hindsight on subreddits for the most part. Doge is the epitome of a hype play, and without Elon Musk, it would unlikely be in the place it is today.”

Wright said meme-based cryptocurrencies might suffer a sharp fall if there are more investments in the near future. People will invest in the crypto tokens but then sell off their earnings, creating another crash. This is similar to what happened after cryptocurrencies peaked in spring 2021, as many have now lost a significant chunk of value.

Is Shiba Inu coin going to rise again?

Shib coin has risen by about 60% in recent weeks after it hit its lowest value ever in July, according to Investing Cube. But the price shows there is still some support for the crypto token, which has seen a jump in movement over 25-day and 50-day periods, as I wrote for the Deseret News.","('https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YOsFpsssouZswDpzq6WOQdAQWEk=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22493918/Dogecoin_1_Purple_Website_Illustration.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,The Motley Fool,Why Cryptocurrencies Are Down Big Today,https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/24/why-cryptocurrencies-are-down-big-today/,"What happened

In another volatile day, cryptocurrencies dropped rapidly on Tuesday, more than reversing Monday's gains. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) has fallen 3%, Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) is down 5%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) has dropped 7.6%. Momentum also appears to be pushing these cryptocurrencies lower, so the fall may not be over yet.

As usual, regular volatility is likely the biggest driver with cryptocurrencies simply selling off as investors take profits. But there are some fundamental concerns that investors are likely worried about as well.

So what

I think the biggest concern is hackers stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks. The $600 million hack of the Poly Network hit the sector a couple of weeks ago, but those funds have now been returned. It's a lower-profile $97 million heist last week that investors may just be hearing about. Theives have reportedly already ""cleaned"" $20 million in cryptocurrencies that may not be recovered and it's possible most of the stolen cryptocurrency is gone. If hacking risk grows, it could be terrible for cryptocurrencies long-term.

The regulatory front is full of risks as well. SEC chair Gary Gensler has said he is in favor of rules that protect investors and consumers without completely killing cryptocurrencies. And for now that means treating them as securities, just like any stock or bond. That comes with a double-edged sword: On one hand, it signals legitimacy that could increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies; on the other hand, it could mean broad tax consequences for traders and investors. And with rules still up in the air, it's not surprising to see a pullback when cryptocurrencies rise like they did yesterday.

On the trading angle, it's not unusual for an asset to pull back after a quick increase in price. In the case of each of these cryptocurrencies, you can see that they jumped over 50% in value over the last month, before today's pullback. Sometimes a correction is just a normal part of investing.

Now what

The battle between cryptocurrency fans and the traditional financial infrastructure continues, and it will be a volatile ride. But I think it's clear that cryptocurrencies are carving out a niche for themselves, whether that's as a store of value or a way to pay for goods and services. But there are still unknowns when it comes to how governments around the world will treat cryptocurrencies.

What's most concerning long-term is the regular hacks that hit cryptocurrency wallets. If investors and consumers can't trust that their cryptocurrency will be safe they may not adopt it as widely as many hope. And that's ultimately what will keep cryptocurrency values from growing.

I would chalk today up as another example of volatility in cryptocurrencies, but watch the hacking and regulatory trends for cryptocurrencies because that's what will likely tell us if this pullback is temporary or the start of a downward trend.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640537/bitcoin-bubble-bursting.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrency accounts holding roughly $50 million or more worth of bitcoin have steadily increased their buying since the end of June, according to new data from blockchain firm Chainalysis. That bullishness continued into late August as prices rebounded above $50,000.

More people are jumping into cryptocurrency, many because of how easy it's become to trade the digital assets, a CNBC/Momentive Invest in You survey found. More than 10% of those surveyed said they're invested in cryptocurrency, ranking the digital coins fourth after real estate, stocks, mutual funds and bonds. Some 65% of those cryptocurrency investors jumped into the asset class in the last year, according to the survey. In the same timeframe, the prices of some of the top cryptocurrencies have displayed trademark volatility. Bitcoin, for example, surged to an all-time high of more than $63,000 in April, slumped afterwards and then recently rallied again to nearly $50,000. Among those who do trade cryptocurrencies, the top reasons cited are that it's easy to make trades, it's exciting to invest in and there's potential for high growth in a short period of time, according to the survey.

""There are a lot of things that make crypto very attractive; the biggest one is the opportunity to make a lot of money,"" said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York. Education is key Of course, there is still risk associated with investing in cryptocurrency, as there is with any other asset. The space may be exciting and cool, said Boneparth, ""but it doesn't change the fact that you're still putting risk on your money."" For people who are interested in jumping in, experts recommend that they first do their research on cryptocurrency to make sure they really understand what they're buying. More from Invest in You:

The worldwide crypto market valuation is now $2.08 trillion, down 2.72 percent from the previous day.

The overall crypto market volume over the last 24 hours has decreased by 0.77 percent to $111.70 billion. The overall volume of all stable coins is now $86.85 billion, accounting for 77.75 percent of the total 24-hour volume of the crypto market. Bitcoin is presently valued at $49,236.56.

El Salvador

El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, who was a driving force behind the country's adoption of Bitcoin (BTC), stated that residents will be able to convert their cryptocurrency to fiat currency as soon as Bitcoin is recognized as legal tender.

Bukele stated 4.5 million individuals in El Salvador would have the option of HODLing their Bitcoin or ""withdraw[ing] it in cash at any of the 200 ATMs"" once the country formally adopted the cryptocurrency as legal tender. According to El Salvador's president, there will be 50 outlets with the ability to withdraw or deposit fiat, allowing residents to hold crypto or liquidate their salaries quickly.

VISA

With a $150,000 purchase of a CryptoPunk, the collection of digital artworks that pioneered the mainstream culture of the sector back in 2017, credit card giant Visa has made a big impression in the nonfungible token (NFT) arena.

Visa bought CryptoPunk 7610, a female figure with a mohawk, clown green eyes, and lipstick, which was claimed on June 23, 2017 and sold a month later for 0.6 Ether (ETH) ($114 at the time).

Ethereum

Geth, Ethereum's most popular software client, has released a hotfix for a critical security flaw in its code.

According to a message on the release page, the patches were kept under wraps ""to give node operators and downstream projects time to update their nodes and software.""

Tether

Tether, the world's largest stablecoin, USDT, has resumed printing after a two-month hiatus that alarmed investors and generated speculation.

Tether has generated at least 2.3 billion USDT since August 1, bringing the token's market cap to $65 billion, according to a Tether spokesman. The USDT is normally traded at $1 and is tied to the US dollar.

For Tanja Vidovic, it was a moment of panic: She had received a series of alerts about someone changing access to her cryptocurrency account. And she realized, as she stared at her computer screen, that nearly all of her $168,000 in holdings was gone — vanished before her eyes. She was stunned. Nearly four months have passed, and it has yet to sink in, she said. Tanja and Jared Vidovic jumped into cryptocurrency investing in 2017 and watched their funds nearly quadruple over four years. The Vidovics used Coinbase, the country's largest cryptocurrency exchange, for their plunge into the virtual currency. On exchanges such as Coinbase, users can deposit U.S. dollars and trade them for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, which the couple purchased. ""I looked into Coinbase, and it seemed like it was one that everybody used and trusted,"" Tanja said. The growing investment was a welcome boon for the Safety Harbor, Florida, couple and their three children. But in late April, Tanja, a firefighter, opened her computer to a barrage of security alerts and password change notifications. ""I signed onto the crypto. And I said, 'It's gone,'"" Tanja said. The Vidovics said they tried to contact Coinbase but they couldn't get anybody on the phone. Interviews with Coinbase customers around the country and a review of thousands of complaints reveal a pattern of account takeovers, where users see money suddenly vanish from their account, followed by poor customer service from Coinbase that made those users feel left hanging and angry. Making the issue even worse, cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reversed, according to the FBI. Experts say once criminals access an account, funds can be drained in minutes. Coinbase, which went public in April, has a market cap of about $65 billion, has more than 68 million users in 100-plus countries, more than 2,100 full-time employees and $223 billion in held assets, according to the company.

""Hopefully, Coinbase going public and having its direct listing is going to be viewed as kind of a landmark moment for the crypto space,"" CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC in April, when the company went public. ""People no longer need to be scared of it like in the early days."" While the cryptocurrency exchange company has grown rapidly, complaints have continued to arise. Since 2016, Coinbase users have filed more than 11,000 complaints against Coinbase with the Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, mostly related to customer service. Former employees told CNBC the company's customer service practices shifted over time, with representatives struggling to keep up with demand.

Money vanished

The Vidovics' account had risen to $168,596 on April 28 when the hacking occurred, according to account statements the Vidovics shared with CNBC. That amount was essentially wiped out, with only a $587.15 balance shown the next day.

Like the Vidovics, Ben, a Virginia resident who asked that his last name be withheld, said he saw thousands of dollars vanish. He logged onto his Coinbase app in March, verifying his identity with two-factor authentication, but over a four-minute stretch almost $35,000 in various coins disappeared from his account, he said. In a response to his frantic email, Coinbase told Ben his computer had been hacked and there wasn't anything the company could do. ""I really am baffled,"" he said. ""It just seems to me that Coinbase did absolutely zero research and just said, 'Hey, yeah, sorry.'"" The CFPB responded to one of Ben's ensuing complaints with an answer from Coinbase's Regulatory Response Team. The email noted that transactions on the blockchain are irrevocable and said Coinbase's insurance policy does not cover theft from individual accounts. ""There is no credible or supportable evidence that the compromise of your login credentials was the fault of Coinbase,"" the message said. ""As a result, Coinbase is unable to reimburse you for your alleged losses."" Eventually, the company sent a $200 credit, telling Ben, ""your Coinbase experience and your wait for a response to your formal complaint was not up to our standards."" Experts say SIM swapping, where fraudsters seize control of a victim's phone number and SIM card through their phone company, is to blame for many of the cryptocurrency thefts. ""The problem with SIM swapping and cryptocurrency is the moment you lose access to your cell phone, professional hackers will steal all of your money in less than 30 minutes,"" said David Silver, an attorney who focuses on cryptocurrency.

Silver, whose firm represents the Vidovics, said the top complaints from potential clients are getting locked out of their cryptocurrency exchange platform account and SIM swaps. ""Most people who contact me would tell you it's poor customer service,"" Silver said. ""They're being almost victimized twice. Because they themselves have almost no ability to contact Coinbase and deal with them directly, they're forced to retain professionals."" Etay Maor, senior director of security strategy for cybersecurity company Cato Networks, said he's seen cybercriminals on the dark web discussing how to break into accounts, including those of Coinbase users. Once hackers break into Coinbase accounts, they put them up for sale on the dark web, according to Maor. He said while credit cards sell for a few dollars, hacked Coinbase accounts can sell for $100 to $150. ""These exchanges have to invest heavily, invest in security if they want to take it seriously, just like the banks have done and have learned the hard way,"" Maor said. Account takeovers are on law enforcement's radar. ""When the attacker withdraws those funds from the exchange, that's not a transaction that you can take back,"" Ali Comolli, a management and program analyst at the FBI, told CNBC.

Comolli said the FBI tries to help victims of account takeovers recover their stolen money. ""It's obviously a huge impact on the victims, which is incredibly difficult for them,"" Comolli said. After a review of Coinbase's complaints, the Better Business Bureau in March determined the company has a ""pattern of complaints from customers who state they are locked out of their accounts, even after providing required information or updates."" The organization has received 1,128 complaints in the past three years, according to its website. BBB said it sent a letter to Coinbase in order to address the customers' complaints and receive feedback from any implemented improvements. The group has ""not heard a response from this business, about the situation, pattern of complaints for the last three years,"" Alma Galvan, a marketing and communication manager with the organization, said in an email to CNBC. Some customers with lost funds turn to social media to seek help from Coinbase or find community with other disgruntled users. Members of a 941-person Facebook group called ""Coinbase Corruption/Scandal Awareness Group"" update the page with their struggles to recoup money and accounts. One poster referred to the group as a ""sad party,"" and several have brainstormed new places to report their complaints and new methods to pressure Coinbase into making them whole. Complaints abound on Reddit and Twitter as well, where the company's support accounts often publicly reply to the messages, sometimes writing that they have ""escalated"" the issue to an appropriate team. The Coinbase Support account on Twitter also posts live updates about changes and temporary errors on the exchange platform.

Struggling to keep pace

As the company has scaled into its massive size, customer service practices have changed, former Coinbase employees told CNBC. In Coinbase's early years, employees spoke with customers through a live help chat. Jason Rose, who worked part-time in customer service at Coinbase from 2014 until 2016, said many customers asked for reassurance about cryptocurrency. ""They need that touch of somebody being there while they're going through this complex transaction,"" he said. When Rose worked at Coinbase, he said live chat acted as a sort of ""release valve"" for complaints, particularly helpful in moments of crypto volatility. As the company grew, Rose said, his role changed. Coinbase started a repository of answers to frequently asked questions in order to automate its customer service. Rose said when he left in 2016 Coinbase was starting to phase out live chat. ""The decision to do that was disastrous because the time that it took to respond back to emails took a lot longer than it would for a live chat. So, we went back to the email box, taking five days to complete a problem that could have been solved in a few minutes,"" he said. Jacques Reulet also fielded customer issues and said it was hard to keep up. ""We were very diligent about making sure that everyone who wrote in got a response, but things were getting a little unresponsive towards the end [of my time there],"" said Reulet, who worked in operations and compliance at Coinbase from 2014 to 2015. ""The sheer scale at which the company was growing was a lot to handle. I didn't see that we were keeping up."" On Jan. 15, Coinbase acknowledged that many new and existing customers are experiencing delays in their response time. ""We recognize this is frustrating. This is not the experience we want for you, our customers,"" said Casper Sorensen, vice president of customer experience, in a blog post. A July blog post announced the company's intent to roll out live chat messaging and phone support this year, as well as to expand its customer support team. The customer service issue also came up on an earnings call earlier this month. ""So proud to report that we are doing much better [with customer service], but there's always more to do,"" said CEO Armstrong. ""We've increased the headcount five times or so since January, beginning of this year, working on support specifically."" Coinbase, which declined repeated requests from CNBC for an on-camera interview, instead said in an email, ""Over the years, we've consistently updated our customer support offerings to help us scale. In early 2020, we moved to email as our primary channel of support. Many of our customer inquiries require our agents to conduct a significant amount of research to resolve the issue. And, to avoid long wait times, communicating asynchronously via email was the preferred method. However, we recognize that customers want real-time support, and that's why we're rolling out phone support for ATOs this month and live messaging for all customers later this year."" Asked about the number of customer service complaints, the company said: ""Over the past several years, our customer base grew exponentially. We grew from 43+ million users at the end of 2020 to 68+ million registered users, as of June 30, 2021. Through all this growth, some of our customers unfortunately experienced challenges and delays reaching our support team, which resulted in a negative impact for some of our customers. Improving our customer experience remains a top priority for Coinbase."" The company would not disclose how many customers' accounts have been taken over by fraudsters or the total amount it has refunded customers as a result of hacks. It added that since customers have a two-factor authentication, at the minimum, to access their accounts, only ""a small number (less than .01%) of our customers have been impacted by account takeovers."" Marci Preble, a California-based marketer, said Coinbase did credit her account the approximate amount of her original investment. But she said that was after months of a nightmare of what seemed like endless emails.

NEW DELHI: Scott Conger, Mayor of Jackson, Tennessee, in the US, is highly optimistic about bitcoins; he has said that the price of bitcoins will continue to rise as the Federal Reserve System continues to print dollars. He believed that bitcoins are definitely the future monetary system.Such is the consistent rise of bitcoins that at the time when the Mayor tweeted, the BTC price was $49,626.81, and it shot up over $50K on 24th August. He said that since bitcoin is an appreciating asset, it can benefit the finances of the city after working out the initial capital and energy costs.Scott is pushing for adopting cryptocurrency as an additional, alternative source of investment for employees and businessmen, which will, in turn, generate revenue for Jackson.The mayor has launched a blockchain task force in the city to find ways to accept bitcoins for making property tax payments. This would allow employees to carry out Dollar Cost Averaging ( DCA) in bitcoins for enhancing their portfolios.Scott had earlier spoken about exploring options for payroll conversions for Jackson city employees. He had also explained about the possibility of getting huge revenue through very low investments with the mining of bitcoins that can appreciate fourfolds within the next year.Ever since Scott became the Mayor of Jackson in June 2021, he has been advocating adopting cryptocurrency in the city government to usher in a new era of industrial revolution with sustainable economies that will help close the wealth gap.Mayor Conger is one of the few mayors in the US who wants to integrate bitcoin in the regulatory framework.There are others such as Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who has pushed for accepting Bitcoin for tax and salary payment and Mayor Jayson Stewart of Cool Valley, Missouri who raised $1000 in BTC for every resident in the city.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85593557,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

NEW DELHI: India ranks 2nd in terms of cryptocurrency adoption is a proof of the growing investor interest around the digital currency. But before you start investing you must know which wallet is the best for storing your cryptocurrency?Read on as we discuss the different types of wallets and their unique features.Interestingly, a crypto wallet is in the form of a device or software that does not store currency, but stores keys for doing transactions, besides helping in encrypting, and signing information. They store the information that keeps your funds safe. Very importantly, Bitcoins and altcoins are not stored in wallets, but in an online ledger called blockchain.The two main kinds of crypto wallets based on internet connectivity and vulnerability are Hot wallets and Cold wallets.* Hot wallets have internet connectivity and help users receive and send tokens, facilitating basic transactions across the internet.* However, they are also most prone to cyberattacks and thefts because of being in online mode.* A more prudent way to use these wallets is by storing a small portion of your crypto holdings in them that you need for immediate investment, and keep the rest in cold wallets.* They exist in offline mode so their security cannot be compromised.* It stores the user's address and private keys and works in conjunction with compatible software in the computer.* They can also be called hardware wallets or offline wallets.Now, Hot wallets can be of three types, depending on the software they use:* These are online services that can be accessed by web browsers on any device. Using them is as easy as signing up for an email account.* Due to open access, it is highly prone to malware, counterparty risks and thefts.* They are good for small transactions and quick investments.Coinbase, MetaChain are some of the web wallets.* A desktop wallet is a software installed on one’s laptop or desktop and provides the user full control over one’s wallet and key.* They are easy to use, give privacy and maintain anonymity.* They need regular clean up and anti-virus checks to ensure security.* When using this wallet, one should try to export a copy of this and store it somewhere else for backup in case of accidental loss of data.* Popular ones are Exodus, Bitcoin core, Armory, Electrum etc.* They work in the same manner as desktop wallets and wallet app can be downloaded on iOS or Android mobile.* They have QR codes for trading in crypto.* They are very convenient to use. Mycelium, Bitcoin wallet are some examples.You also have Hardware wallets that are recommended for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency securely. They can be connected to any device with a USB cable and work like a flash drive. They store keys on physical devices rather than software.While using, a hardware wallet asks for transaction details and validates the data itself. Trezor and Ledger Nano S are some hardware ledgers available in the market. It costs a lot more than a software wallet.Then there are also paper wallets, that as the name suggests exist in the form of paper. They have keys and QR codes like mobile wallets to facilitate crypto transactions. However, they run the risk of being lost or damaged .","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85593013,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35076,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

A 'maximalist' vision of bitcoin means every company will be a crypto company.

Oh what a difference a summer makes.

Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) slow but steady rebound from its spring lows saw the crypto unit top $50,000 on Monday, with the latest move greased by PayPal’s (PYPL) announcement that it would let U.K.-based customers trade in crypto, something U.S. clients had already been offered since October.

It seems like just yesterday (May, to be exact) when Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s off-the-cuff remarks ricocheted across the crypto market, lighting the fuse on a sell-off that eventually dragged bitcoin to its 2021 nadir below $30,000.

At the time, Paul Donovan, UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief economist, declared that the episode served as a “reminder that if one person can dramatically alter spending power, the ‘stable store of value' criteria of a currency is not met.”

Indeed, skeptics have resorted to a slew of aphorisms and adjectives to describe bitcoin (billionaire investor Warren Buffett prefers “rat poison,” for example). “Stable” certainly isn’t among them, with the digital coin prone to dramatic, occasionally double-digit daily price swings that belie its aspirations of becoming a reliable store of value to rival the U.S. dollar.

The latest move punctuates a particularly busy period for the digital currency, and crystallizes something that even its biggest critics have to acknowledge. Cryptocurrency in general, and bitcoin in particular, has been gaining major currency (pun intended) across sectors.

PayPal’s decision is “a sign that every company will eventually be a crypto company — they just don’t know it yet,” Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview on Monday. “And I think this trend is just getting started.”

Story continues

She was only half joking. In addition to the PayPal move, Wall Street is making crypto increasingly available to its clientele, while Facebook (FB) is also making its own ripples in the sector (albeit with a scaled-back version of its original grand design). Separately, trading platforms are clearly reaping the benefits of transacting in crypto (looking at you, Robinhood (HOOD)).

“Crypto’s not a fad. There are elements of this, certainly, that feel a little speculative and bubbly… but if we zoom out and look at the secular 10-, 20-year trend… we view crypto as a fundamental enabling component of this new digital world,” Demirors added.

It cuts to the heart of what noted bitcoin evangelist and crypto investor Anthony Pompliano wrote in a letter to subscribers on Monday. Waxing poetic about how digital currencies were ushering in a “monetary revolution,” Pompliano laid out a vision in which maximizing the use of crypto (i.e. “maximalism”) will eventually make prices far less whipsaw.

“The crazy part is that if monetary maximalism ends up playing out how I believe it will, bitcoin will eventually be incredibly stable in value. The price of goods and services will be denominated in bitcoin and the average bitcoin holder won’t see any level of volatility,” Pompliano wrote.

“When this occurs, people will have a choice to simply spend less than they make in an effort to save bitcoin. Or they will be available to invest in other assets to acquire more bitcoin than what they would simply be allowed to save,” he added.

To be certain, bitcoin’s frothy price and lack of convertibility in the most quotidian transactions (think paying rent, buying coffee and dining out, for example), leaves a lot to be desired for the average citizen. And polling suggests they are still not true believing acolytes like Pompliano and Demirors.

Yet the digital coin’s resilience is nothing to sneeze at. With all due respect to the Oracle of Omaha, its growing credibility among large and small investors is a sign of its maturation, according to Chris Kline, COO and co-founder of Bitcoin IRA.

“The widespread adoption of crypto ranges from governments to major corporations, further legitimizing the seriousness of digital assets,” Kline told Yahoo Finance in an email.

“Make no mistake about it, the world wants crypto to stay. In addition, you’re seeing the adoption of crypto for use in payments, real estate, and art, which are contributing to the rising value of digital assets,” he added.

This marked the first time it exceeded that point in three months. The boost came in light of investors piling onto the crypto coin in a bargain-buying spree. At its peak, the popular cryptocurrency hit a high of $50,152.24, which was up 2.5 per cent since mid-May. Speaking on the recent gains that Bitcoin saw this week, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex said, “If there is an increase in trading volumes and bulls manage to gain momentum, we might see a dash towards $61,000 this week. We are only at the beginning of the week, and things are already looking exciting for the week ahead.""

Cryptocurrency is the new rage for many reasons. It is untraceable, it is secure and it is a good way to make a great deal of money via investments. However, digital currency does come with its own set of drawbacks such as high market volatility, unpredictability and lack of regulation which does not do much to inspire confidence in first-time investors. So, before you dive into the crypto pool, there are a few things you should know.

Trading on Crypto Exchanges: What You Need to Know

Much like buying and selling shared on the stock exchanges, cryptocurrency trading is done primarily through crypto exchanges. These exchanges aid you as the investor to trade cryptocurrencies based on their current market value. This value is determined by demand, supply and the overall condition of the market. There are several layers of fees that you need to be aware of before attempting this.

Exchange Fees

The first level is the exchange fees. This is the amount charged by the exchange to complete a buy or sell order. Most of the exchanges in India have a fixed fee model but the end cost depends on the platform that you opt for. This fee is the primary mode of revenue for these exchanges so keep that in mind when choosing. The fee that these exchanges charge is generally between 0.1 per cent to 1 per cent or more for each trade. This means if you invest around $1,000 in the trade, the commission to the exchange would be around $100 or so.

Network Fees

The essential premise of cryptocurrencies is that they need to be mined using a lot of computer hardware. This network fee goes to the miners who dedicate their time and effort to doing so. It also helps you verify and validate each and every transaction to make sure your crypto coins have not been used before. This fee, however, is not controlled by the exchange and is set in place by the miners and is based entirely on demand. The more traffic on the network, i.e., the higher the demand, the more the fees may increase.

Wallet Fees

A crypto wallet is like an online bank account for your digital coins. It helps keep your cryptocurrency safe. Additionally, it also allows the holder to send and receive coins. Think of it like a Paytm wallet. Most of these wallets do not charge you any fees, but if you opt for a crypto wallet that comes in-built with most exchanges, then you could face an additional wallet handling charge. One would use the wallet to store the cryptocurrency amidst trading. The fees come into play whenever you send crypto coins to someone else. It basically comes in as a form of network fees.

miners to resume their endeavours from September 22. The country had announced restrictive measures in May amid an increasing power deficit causing blackouts in many parts of the country.

China, on the other hand, is decisively cracking down on mining and has no intention of rolling back its cryptocurrency ban.

While Iran is endorsing Bitcoin for self-preservation, China is against decentralised systems to retain maximum control and exert dominance.

Regulations around cryptocurrency saw a lot of upheaval over the past one year world over. While China continues to maintain its strict anti-cryptocurrency stance, other countries — like Iran — are softening their stance.According to Iran's state-owned company for power generation and distribution — Iran Power Generation, Distribution, and Transmission Company (Tavanir) — the ban on cryptocurrency mining will be lifted come September 22.The Financial Tribune reports that the utility will start resupplying electricity to mining farms in a bid to collect what's touted as the world's newest financial assets Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.But, on the other side of the world, in China, the government has warned its local electricity manufacturers to keep from selling its spare capacity to Bitcoin miners, local or otherwise. The companies, located in the provinces where mining has been banned, have till August 24 to completely dismantle mining farms and move any leftover mining equipment out of the area.The county’s Ministry of Industries, Mining, and Trade is expected to give out an official diktat soon, reversing the restrictions applied on all miners in May . Simply put, Iran's national grid will again be fully available for mining cryptocurrencies , a unique initiative to reduce the country's dependence on the globalised US dollar and other fiat currencies.Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, the spokesman of the nationalised energy company, explained that power consumption in the Islamic Republic is expected to decline in the coming months as the summer has ended.The country was forced to take regressive steps like a blanket ban since its power deficit was acutely high in the hot month of May. This led to blackouts and load sheddings in multiple parts of the country. Sincemining is an energy-intensive process, Iran was forced to ration its electricity and crackdown on miners.China is confident it wants nothing to do with cryptocurrencies. At one point, Chinese mines powered nearly 80% of the global trade in cryptocurrencies despite a domestic trading ban since 2017. But all of it came to an abrupt end in May when Beijing swiftly asked provincial governments, regulators, and energy companies to stop supplying energy to mining farms. Miners had little option but to comply and find an alternative plan to keep their business going.Gradually, all miners started migrating out of the country and found a new home in many parts of the US, Kazakhstan, Canada, and even Russia. A recent ruling by a northern Shandong province's high court said that the Chinese law does not protect cryptocurrencies, and the assets never had legal status. The verdict is a final nail in the coffin for cryptocurrencies in the country, and there's little hope of taking a step back.Iran faces severe sanctions from the US and is restricted from directly transacting in the international market. This limits its exposure to the US dollar, which is often considered the de facto globalised currency for trade. Foreign exchange against other fiat currencies is significantly tricky, making it a challenging task to get imports, in turn limiting the scope of growth. This, in turn, makes cryptocurrency an attractive alternative for the country.According to an Elliptic report, Iran contributes 4.5% of all total Bitcoin mining, raking in revenues of nearly $1 billion each year.For China, the ambition is very different. It has always focused on a centrally backed digital currency (CBDC), and its e-yuan experiment is slowly expanding to more and more citizens. At the same time, the government has cracked down on private players in the payments industry, intending to gradually phase out closed ecosystems and creating a centrally controlled digital currency that can be leveraged at an international scale.With its industrial influence rising in south-east Asia, Africa, and other developing markets, China aims to establish a dollar-equivalent at a global scale. Its idea is to dominate the global economy by getting the early-adopter advantage. At the same time, a central system gives it full authority over censorship, surveillance, and even the country's monetary policy.The two countries are in an entirely different scenario and trying to leverage the crypto boom in their favour.

Aussies made more than $10,000 in profit from their cryptocurrency investments in the past 12 months — the equivalent to nearly two months of the average Australian salary.

More than three quarters of Aussies made a profit from their crypto investments over the last year too, according to research from YouGov, with the average profit adding up to $10,662.

But more than one in five Aussie cryptocurrency holders said they made a massive amount of profits worth over $30,000, the survey found.

Interestingly, Aussie parents with children under 18 at home were the most likely to make money from their cryptocurrency trading, with 86 per cent reporting a profit that added up on average to $12,428.

The crypto market ran hot over the last year, said Swyftx head of strategic partnerships, Tommy Honan, an Australian cryptocurrency exchange with more than 320,000 customers, which commissioned the survey.

“So even though we’ve just come out of a dip in the market we’re still seeing a lot of Aussies reporting profits on their trades over the last 12 months,” he noted.

“Aussie millennials and Gen Xers saw especially big returns, with around one in five saying they made more than $20,000 over the last year from cryptocurrency. Aussie mums and dads appear to have been especially successful, as well as men in general and crypto users who report a strong or some understanding of the market.”

Men achieved an average $11,357 profit on their crypto over the last 12 months, while women achieved an average of $9,176, the survey revealed.

In terms of location, crypto users in Brisbane were the most likely to report a profit with 83 per cent making money, followed by Sydney and Melbourne at 76 per cent and then Perth.

Mr Honan said he expected to see further improvements in the market this year following a market fall in May and June.

“Experienced investors have been buying the dip in the expectation that Bitcoin could hit the US $100,000 price by the end of the year,” he said.

But if you’re new to crypto, Mr Honan said it’s best to do your research before buying.

“The group who were least likely to report a profit on their crypto holdings over the last year were people who said they had little or no understanding of the market,” he said.

“At the moment, this is a relatively small proportion of crypto users in the country, just 16 per cent report having little or no understanding. But for this group and anyone who wants to grow their confidence, it really is essential to do your research.”

“Pro tips are to research the team behind any digital assets you are thinking of buying, and also look at indicators like the size of a coin’s market and its liquidity.”

Financial regulators around the world have begun to scrutinise cryptocurrency as they investigate implementing regulations.

In the UK, the financial watchdog has warned that people should be prepared to lose all their money if investing in cryptocurrency, while it also banned trading exchange Binance.

Poly Network, a platform in the decentralized finance or ""DeFi"" space, was hit by a major attack this month which saw the hacker, or hackers, steal more than $600 million worth of digital tokens. The thief exploited a vulnerability in Poly Network's code which allowed them to transfer the funds to their own accounts.

In a strange twist, the Poly Network hacker didn't run off with the haul. Instead, they opened a dialogue with the organization that was targeted, promising to return all the funds. And, sure enough, the hacker gave back nearly all of the money — with the exception of $33 million of tether, or USDT, which was frozen by its issuers.

There was a catch, however. More than $200 million of assets was trapped in an account that required passwords from both Poly Network and the hacker. For some time, the hacker refused to hand over their password, simply saying they would only do so once ""everyone is ready.""

Poly Network pleaded with the hacker, which it is calling ""Mr. White Hat,"" to return the remaining funds. The platform promised to grant the unidentified person a $500,000 bounty for helping it identify a flaw in its systems, and even offered them a job as ""chief security advisor.""

Now, the hacker has finally given Poly Network access to the final tranche of stolen funds. In a blog post Monday, the firm said Mr. White Hat shared the so-called private key needed to regain control of the remaining assets.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929924-1629309517996-gettyimages-959428194-bs_4561.jpeg?v=1629309551',)",none
2021-08-23,Gadgets 360,Google Play Store Removes 8 Fake Cryptocurrency Mining Apps for Tricking Users: Trend Micro,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-fake-app-google-play-store-remove-btc-eth-wallet-cloud-mining-trend-micro-how-to-determine-2517245,"Cryptocurrency is a trending topic, and now, Google Play has removed eight deceptive cryptocurrency apps after they were discovered to be fake and tricking users to watch advertisements, as per security firm Trend Micro. These apps masqueraded as cryptocurrency cloud mining apps where users can earn cryptocurrency by investing money into a cloud-mining operation. Trend Micro reports that these eight malicious apps tricked victims into watching ads, paying for subscription services that have an average monthly fee of $15 (roughly Rs. 1,100) and paying for increased mining capabilities without getting anything in return.

Trend Micro reports that the eight fake cryptocurrency apps were: BitFunds – Crypto Cloud Mining, Bitcoin Miner – Cloud Mining, Bitcoin (BTC) – Pool Mining Cloud Wallet, Crypto Holic – Bitcoin Cloud Mining, Daily Bitcoin Rewards – Cloud Based Mining System, Bitcoin 2021, MineBit Pro - Crypto Cloud Mining & btc miner, and Ethereum (ETH) - Pool Mining Cloud. The firm says that two of these malicious apps were even paid; meaning users had to purchase them on installation. This strategy was used to gain trust of the user. Trend Micro says Crypto Holic – Bitcoin Cloud Mining costed $12.99 (roughly Rs. 960) to download, while Daily Bitcoin Rewards – Cloud Based Mining System costed $5.99 (roughly Rs. 450).

The firm says that these fake apps had no cryptocurrency-mining behaviour. They are said to have carried out bogus mining activity via a local mining simulation module that included a counter and some random functions. These apps lured users to pay for increased cryptocurrency-mining capabilities via the apps' in-app billing systems that range from $14.99 (roughly Rs. 1,111) to as high as $189.99 (roughly Rs. 14,000), as per Trend Micro.

Trend Micro says that one of the apps, MineBit Pro, also revealed in its terms of use that it is merely an “educational simulation/game developed to better teach people about crypto money ecosystem.” The terms clarify that return of money for any virtual goods purchased was not guaranteed. In addition, these apps are said to be flooded with ads of different kinds with false promises like increase mining speed, promises to start mining after viewing video ads, and more.

Google is said to have already removed these apps from Google Play, but Trend Micro says that when it searched keywords like ‘cloud mining' on Google Play it found many concerning apps of the same type. Few of these apps have even been downloaded more than 100,000 times, as per the security firm.

Trend Micro advises that in order to determine whether an app is phony, users can carefully read the app's reviews and pay more attention to the 1-star review. Also, try entering a wrong cryptocurrency wallet address. If the app accepts it and is able to perform follow-up operations, then it is likely to be fraudulent. Recheck if there is a withdrawal fee. The transfer of cryptocurrency requires a handling fee, which is relatively high compared to what is typically made from cloud mining. Hence, free-of-cost withdrawals should be considered very suspicious.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/crypto_apps_trend_micro_1629783918725.jpg',)",none

PayPal launches crypto buying and selling in the UK



PayPal Holdings Inc will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week, the company said on Monday. The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class. With over 403 million active accounts globally, the company is one of the largest mainstream financial companies to offer consumers access to cryptocurrencies. It launched crypto buying and selling in the US in early 2021 and enabled customers to use their digital coin holdings to shop at the millions of merchants on its network. Read details here.

""We uncovered several findings that illustrate a seismic shift in financial services resulting from the evolution of blockchain-based digital assets,"" consultants led by Linda Pawczuk at the accountancy company Deloitte wrote alongside a report that found 76% of finance professionals think bitcoin and crypto could serve as an alternative to or replacement for fiat currencies in the next five to 10 years.

A strong majority (81%) of the almost 1,300 executives questioned think blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, is broadly scalable and has already achieved mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, 73% think their company should adopt crypto and blockchain or risk losing competitive advantage.

""The foundation of banking has been fundamentally outlived and financial services industry players must redefine themselves and find innovative ways to create economic growth in the future of money,"" Pawczuk, who heads up Deloitte's global blockchain and digital assets practice, said in a statement alongside the report.

This year, Wall Street banks from Goldman Sachs GS to JPMorgan JPM have begun rolling out bitcoin and crypto services to their clients as central banks around the world experiment with blockchain-based central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

The cryptocurrency traded at roughly $49,400 by the afternoon session, still shy of its all-time high above $64,000 set in April.

The space has seen a boost in the past week on increasing adoption. PayPal said Monday it would open its platform in the U.K. to crypto buying and selling, and Coinbase said last week that it would buy $500 million in cryptocurrency on its balance sheet.

Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Capital, is a bitcoin bull but remains wary of jumping in right here.

""I think it needs to be in your portfolio, but is $50,000 the place to be buying it? I wouldn't chase it,"" Baruch told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Monday.

Bitcoin fell below $30,000 during a summer sell-off. Weakness in recent months was largely tied to a regulatory crackdown in China wherein some mining operations were forced to close. Since a June low of $28,600, it has rallied 73%.

In a separate email to CNBC, Baruch said he owns bitcoin but began to trim his holdings once it bounced back to $45,000 — roughly the same level as its 200-day moving average and a 50% retracement level measured from its April peak and its June low. He said that level could prove a good entry point if bitcoin falls back to it.

""Again, I think it's a great space to be in, but don't chase it just because you see $50,000 in the headlines. Pick your spots and stick to your game plan,"" he said.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106898939-16239476502021-06-17t162640z_286660568_rc2g2o9bp75h_rtrmadp_0_cryto-currency-usa-politics.jpeg?v=1629754707',)",none

The Japanese Liquid exchange reported the unfolding events in a series of tweets.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

The company revealed the wallet addresses which were used by the hacker to steal the funds, and temporarily froze all activity on the exchange while assessing the extent of the hack’s impact.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX) and Ripple (XRP) were the main assets targeted in the theft.

Coin mixers that randomly pool and clean cryptocurrencies in a non-custodial fashion have been used by the hackers to get away with almost half the stolen assets. According to chain data, 6,000 Ethereum (ETH) worth a staggering $20m has already been cycled through mixers into new anonymous wallets.

Uniswap was the decentralised platform used to swap ERC20 tokens stolen in the heist for more liquid Ether.

Authorities are working to recover the remaining 9,600 ETH which the hacker is yet to move from their wallet. The Japanese exchange remains hopeful the Ether valued at $32m can be recovered.

Progress was made over the weekend according to updates from Liquid on its corporate blog, the company further announced that it had already significantly ramped up network security to ensure protections against future robberies by crypto gangsters.

A wake up call for the industry

Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technical Officer at the Bitfinex derivatives exchange, pointed to the latest hack as a wake up call for the industry. Using the event as an opportunity to suggest a more unified approach with exchanges and trading platforms working together to increase security measures in crypto.

“Today’s hack at the Liquid exchange is the latest security breach in the digital token space,” he said.

Story continues

“This is another warning, if one were needed, to everyone.

“The ingenuity of bad actors seeking to breach the security systems of exchanges and trading platforms will not abate. It is therefore imperative that we work together as an industry with all exchanges remaining in a perpetual state of vigilance against such threats.

“While the safeguarding of customer funds is of course an exchange’s number one priority, holders of cryptocurrencies should take all steps necessary to ensure that their funds are safe.

“These include ensuring that they have a cold wallet, two factor authentication, notification messages when funds are withdrawn, and avoiding public WiFi.”

It's been a good few days for bitcoin investors. The digital token is trading at nearly $50,000, its highest point in months. And many people who've stayed on the sidelines are probably wondering yet again: Is it time to buy the cryptocurrency? Before you put your money into the still highly volatile asset, however, there are three helpful things to consider, according to financial and behavioral experts.

1. Suspecting it's a bubble won't save you

Many investors know what a bubble is: It's what happens when an asset's price far exceeds its real value. And many smart people have expressed concern that bitcoin is a bubble. Still, many have invested in the currency with little caution despite their suspicions that its price is unmoored from its value.

It's common for people to buy assets even when they know they're overvalued, ""because they expect prices to go even higher,"" said Bruce Mizrach, an economics professor at Rutgers University's Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences. And, he said, ""they all believe that they can exit before the bubble crashes."" Just remember: That's what everyone else is thinking. ""By the time most individual investors get into a rising investment, it's often too late,"" said Kent Baker, a finance professor at American University.

2. FOMO often backfires

Stories of crypto-millionaires. People buying houses, thanks to bitcoin. How could you not be experiencing a fear of missing out? Investors often fall prey to the social bias of ""herding,"" Baker said. They do what the crowd does, believing that everyone else must know more than they do and that there's safety in numbers. We can't all lose our all money, they may think.

""Generally, such investors are wrong on both counts,"" Baker said. In reality, the other people ""in the crowd,"" are similarly swayed by the same illusions.

3. There's just still so much we don't know","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106931701-1629727861382-gettyimages-1324486089-60cb1c2a22ab9023d36d30a4_1624174305.jpeg?v=1629727952',)",none

The peer-to-peer system, born in the midst of the global financial crisis, solved problems that troubled cryptographers since 1992.Fast forward to 2021. Today, more people see cryptocurrencies as a tool for investment rather than a currency. In fact, the view that a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin could become a widely accepted currency is now confined to just Bitcoin maximalists.In India, where cryptocurrency adoption is rising fast, businesses involved in the space are breaking away from the ideas of Satoshi Nakamoto — the pseudonym of the person who developed Bitcoin — to paint cryptocurrencies as an asset class. They are trying to convince the government and the monetary authority against banning this form of digital cash.“There is a big misunderstanding… you can’t have Bitcoin (a deflationary asset) compete with the rupee (an inflationary monetary system),” crypto exchange WazirX’s CEO Nischal Shetty had said in February at the ETMarkets Conclave. “You can’t use Bitcoin for everyday transactions because of its high cost.”But does a cryptocurrency even have the attributes to be a “good” asset class?“Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West. This asset class is rife with fraud, scams and abuse in certain applications. There is a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced and complete information,” US Securities Exchange Commission head Gary Gensler said at a recent event.An asset class is defined as a group of instruments that have similar characteristics and are governed by the same regulations.According to Chakri Lokapriya of TCG Asset Management, a good asset class should have liquidity, stability, value and a low transaction cost. “An asset class that can display stability in most of those characteristics can be termed as a ‘good asset class!’” Lokapriya told ETMarkets.com.Even the most ardent supporters of cryptocurrencies have found it hard to deal with the inherent volatility of these instruments. Cryptocurrencies are often prone to flash crashes that could be due to a number of factors, such as a sudden exit of one large investor or systemic failures at cryptocurrency exchanges.While Bitcoin’s liquidity has improved markedly due to the introduction of bite-size coins called Satoshis, others remain vulnerable to sudden bouts of liquidity drying up. A major concern among cryptocurrency investors has been the large holdings among so-called whale investors, whose exit can create market crashes. Market risk, therefore, is one of the biggest vulnerabilities of owning cryptocurrencies.High transaction costs of trading in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is another factor that works against the asset class. Back in April, the average fee of transacting in Bitcoin was at an all-time high of $59 after China’s crackdown on the country's Bitcoin miners. High transaction fee is also one of the major arguments used by traditional investors to discard cryptocurrencies’ utility as a medium of exchange.Bitcoin’s high transaction fee also emits from the high cost of energy that miners face to keep their mining farms running 24 hours a day. According to some reports, the amount of power used to mine Bitcoin is more than the electricity consumption of Argentina.As for cryptocurrencies’ role as a store of value, the jury is still out. While a Bitcoin today is worth Rs. 36 lakh, many still doubt its ability to act as a stable store of value because of the high volatility associated with it. Bitcoin has been equated with digital gold given that its supply is scarce by design.Sceptics such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb say the true value of Bitcoin is zero. The author and risk analyst said in June that Bitcoin can neither be a short-term or long-term store of value, cannot operate as a reliable hedge against inflation, and “worst of all, does not constitute, not even remotely, a tail protection vehicle for catastrophic episodes”.Yet, many institutional investors and Fortune 500 companies are adopting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a hedge against their expectations of high future inflation as well as black swan events like the Covid-19 pandemic. Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy have already converted part or all of their balance sheet cash into Bitcoin. Recently, a Texas-based biotech company converted its cash into Bitcoin to avoid “overreach from banks”.Technical factors aside, one of the biggest hurdles in accepting cryptocurrencies as a good asset class is because of the regulatory uncertainty. The US SEC has already demanded powers from the Congress to regulate both crypto tokens and the entire decentralised finance framework. In India, crypto investors and crypto entrepreneurs want the government to regulate the industry so as to allow innovation to thrive and address misgivings about the asset’s role in money laundering, fraud and terrorism financing.Wealth managers and advisors speak of high networth investors willing to invest in cryptocurrencies through the right channels but unable to do so out of fear of prosecution.In some countries, regulators have shown a willingness to regulate cryptocurrencies as an asset class and allow asset management companies to launch instruments such as exchange-traded funds, crypto-backed bonds and the likes that provide access to common investors in a risk-controlled environment.Perhaps, among the many problems that cryptocurrencies have to tackle to be acknowledged as a good and viable asset class, regulation could be the first step in the journey.With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman suggesting a more calibrated approach to cryptocurrencies in the proposed cryptocurrency law, investors will hope the death of a utopian-style currency will give birth to the foundation of a stable asset class.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85554970,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76298,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Euronews,Could Cardano’s 'green' cryptocurrency ADA take over Bitcoin and Ethereum?,https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/23/could-cardano-s-green-cryptocurrency-ada-take-over-bitcoin-and-etherium,"The little known cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) has come out of nowhere to become the third-largest after Bitcoin and Ethereum following a recent price surge as blockchain enthusiasts look for more climate-friendly options.

Cardano’s price has gone up by more than 36 per cent in the last week and its market capitalisation stands at $90.60 billion (€76 billion), according to crypto website CoinMarketCap.

What is Cardano and what are the reasons for its success? Here’s everything you need to know.

What is Cardano?

Cardano is a blockchain platform and it has its own internal cryptocurrency called ADA.

The tokens are named after Augusta ""Ada"" King, or Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century British countess known for her work on a theoretical computation engine. She is largely regarded as the first computer programmer and is the daughter of the poet Lord Byron.

ADA is named after 'Ada lovelace', a 19th-century British countess known for her work on a theoretical computation engine. Cardano website

Cardano was established in 2015 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and was launched in 2017. Since then, the token has returned 7,080 per cent to investors.

Cardano is the largest cryptocurrency to use a proof of stake blockchain model, which is considered a greener alternative.

As crypto enthusiasts become more aware of the environmental impact of cryptos, Cardano has an upper hand over Bitcoin and Ethereum, and this could be one reason for its recent success.

Recent figures from Bitcoinenergyconsumption.com show Bitcoin’s estimated annual emissions is over 57 million tonnes of CO2 per year, which is about the same annual carbon footprint as a small European country.

Meanwhile, Iran and China temporarily banned all crypto mining this summer because computers used in the process were sapping too much electricity and causing power cuts.

Proof of stake works by randomly allocating coins to users, who put up coins for collateral. This differs from the proof of work mechanism - used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum - which requires a global network of computers to run at the same time when a transaction takes place.

This method is designed to encourage increased computing effort for transactions, which uses much more energy than proof of stake.

On its website, Cardano says: ""We have changed science. We have changed what it means to build global systems and sustainable models of exchange and governance.

""We, alongside our community and partners, are defining a new future: a decentralised future without intermediaries, in which power is returned to the individual"".

What are the reasons for Cardano’s success?

Over the last two weeks, the cryptocurrency market has been rallying. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been leading the wave but 'altcoins' - alternative digital currencies to Bitcoin - have also gathered pace in the price race.

Cardano’s price surge came after it announced a major upgrade called Alonzo, which will launch in September.

Alonzo will introduce smart contracts to the blockchain. Smart contracts are programmes stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They are typically used to automate the execution of an agreement and will allow Cardano to deploy their own smart contracts and pave the way for its own decentralised applications (dApps).

Another reason for Cardano’s surge is that from August 25, its coin will be listed on Japan’s exchange after authorisation by the country, which is considered to have one of the strictest criteria for entering the market.

It means Cardano’s ADA will join the elite coins of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin in Japan where it will be put to the test.","('https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/00/50/90/1000x563_cmsv2_510d29c0-64e7-5c4d-9e5e-80b8de1361ed-6005090.jpg',)",none

CAS is the native coin of the Cashaa platform, which offers functions such as speedy processing, discounted set up fees, cheaper international wire cost, rebate in exchange and transaction fees.

Cashaa aims to help crypto businesses access banking infrastructure, and the neo-bank has started rolling out personal accounts across the globe, starting with India.

For this, the neo-bank has tied up with Polygon to reduce the ethereum network fee, which is becoming a bottleneck for small transactions on the network, while at the same time for the enhanced security provided by the network.

Using the bridge, CAS holders will be able to leverage Polygon’s full-stack scaling to minimize transaction fees while transacting with CAS and gain access to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem. Moreover, CAS holders will also be able to stake CAS on the Polygon network to earn up to 30% annually, which will be rewarded in CAS and MATIC tokens.

Matic, is the native currency of Polygon (formerly Matic Network), which was co-founded in 2017 by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun.

“Cashaa has been continuously scaling and now entering into giving personal accounts to increase the adoption of its CAS token, which requires cheaper transaction cost. Association with Polygon is another step towards the same,"" said Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO, Cashaa.

Cashaa will be implementing MATIC tokens in the following products: Cashaa Earn, which earns up to 14% annual interest on deposits; Cashaa Lend, a loan solution of 0% interest rates on cryptocurrency-collateralized fiat loans on bitcoin, Cashaa, ether and matic.

In the last two years, Cashaa has onboarded more than 250 crypto-native businesses who transacted over $1 billion using the Cashaa solution.

A crypto tab will be added to the platform, showing real-time currency prices as well as offering educational content to help answer common questions and learn more about cryptocurrencies, including the potential risks, PayPal said.

The payment company said it hoped that the move to embrace the currency would help improve knowledge and understanding of it.

Cryptocurrencies remain controversial because of their lack of regulation and volatile value fluctuations, and some critics have raised concerns about the anonymity offered to users as part of transactions, arguing the currencies are used by cybercriminals to hide their activities.

Jose Fernandez da Ponte, the vice-president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said the firm’s service could help introduce more people to the technology and how it works, helping to better shape the role the currencies could play in the future.

“The pandemic has accelerated digital change and innovation across all aspects of our lives, including the digitisation of money and greater consumer adoption of digital financial services,” he said.

“Our global reach, digital payments expertise, and knowledge of consumer and businesses, combined with rigorous security and compliance controls provides us the unique opportunity, and the responsibility, to help people in the UK to explore cryptocurrency.

“We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce.”

PayPal confirmed the service would begin rolling out this week and would be available to all eligible customers within the next few weeks.

The firm has launched a similar service in the US, which allows users to make purchases at participating businesses using cryptocurrencies – a feature that has not yet been confirmed for release in the UK.

Laith Khalaf, the head of investment analysis at the financial firm AJ Bell, said he expected the service to be added in the UK at some point soon.

Khalaf said there were signs investors were “leapfrogging traditional forms of savings and diving in at the deep end by investing in crypto”, and that the City regulator was concerned about the potential for consumer harm posed by volatile pricing.

“An alarming statistic is that 14% of UK crypto buyers funded their purchases using debt, according to figures released by the FCA in June. While many are no doubt using crypto as a bit of harmless fun with small amounts of money they can afford to lose, some consumers are at risk of getting sucked in and spat out by the crypto craze,” he said.

“PayPal’s presence is positive in that it is a high-profile, publicly listed company, which is already subject to regulatory scrutiny. But overall the crypto craze remains a worry for consumer advocates and regulators.”","('https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc3755117074a7ad081b2f74a3d5223732e973c/0_300_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=60b96ea8c4342dd260580796b02553dd',)",none
2021-08-23,NDTV Gadgets 360,"Cryptocurrency Payments Now Being Accepted by Over 85,000 Merchants in Switzerland",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-payment-switzerland-swiss-merchant-bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-suisse-worldline-2516578,"Cryptocurrency payments are now being accepted by over 85,000 merchants in Switzerland from their customers through a collaboration between Worldline, a French payment and transactional services company, and Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto-financial services company in Switzerland. In a press release dated August 19, Bitcoin Suisse announced the integrated service named WL Crypto Payments. This omni-channel payment solution will allow all merchants using the Worldline payment services to accept payments in Bitcoin and Ether. The merchants will be able to accept payments in Bitcoin and Ether on point-of-sale (POS) and e-commerce services.

To use this payment service, merchants only need to download the WL Crypto Payments mobile app. They can also install the Worldline payment plugin for their online store.

Clients willing to pay through digital coins may use the mobile cryptocurrency wallet application for this purpose. Prices displayed in Swiss Francs (CHF) will be shown in real-time Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) value, according to the options that a client chooses. The price, to be paid in cryptocurrency, can get confirmed to the merchant instantly.

The transaction is claimed to be safe from volatility risks, as it will be securely converted into CHF after payment is confirmed.

This payment solution was successfully tested in a pilot programme before being rolled out to all Worldline merchants in Switzerland. Worldline and Bitcoin Suisse first collaborated over crypto payments in November 2019.

According to a 2019 press release, the companies intended to reinforce the ""leading position of Switzerland as a strong center in the crypto-financial services industry."" Switzerland houses over 800 companies that offer services or develop solutions for crypto and blockchain companies and is a bustling hub of cryptocurrency growth.

Worldline Switzerland MD Marc Schluep said that this project stood up to their goal of bringing “tangible value to merchants across the globe and to facilitate smooth and modern payments in all the markets"" the firm operates in.

Bitcoin Suisse CEO Dr. Arthur Vayloyan called it a “historic milestone for crypto adoption in Switzerland and beyond,” and added that this step proved yet again that Switzerland was the leader in collaborative innovation and a pioneer in the crypto and blockchain industry.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_ether_stock_unsplash_1629707389109.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,News18,"Bitcoin Price Today Hits $50,000. Will World's Largest Crypto Touch $60,000 this Week?",https://www.news18.com/news/business/bitcoin-price-today-hits-50000-will-worlds-largest-crypto-touch-60000-this-week-4117061.html,"Bitcoin surges $50,000 on Monday – which happened for the first time after the crash that happened in May this year. The world’s largest cryptocurrency price jumped 2.21 per cent to $50,372 at 1200 hours, according to coinmarketcap.com. In April, the world biggest currency Bitcoin surged and hit an all-time high at $65,000. Two positive development this week led to the sharp rise in Bitcoin, the first one being PayPal’s announcement of launching services for buying, selling and holding digital currencies in the UK. This announcement made it the first international expansion of PayPal’s cryptocurrency services outside the United States. Similarly, PayPal launched cryptocurrency services for buying, selling, and holding cryptocurrency in the United States early this year.

The second announcement that led to a sharp rise of Bitcoin was made by Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange platform, that the company will buy $500 million in crypto on its balance sheet and will allocate 10 per cent of its quarterly profits into a crypto assets portfolio on last Thursday. The company said very soon it will become the first traded company to hold Bitcoin rival Ether, DeFi tokens and other crypto assets on its balance sheet.

“Bitcoin is currently trading close to the major psychological level of $50,000. On the daily charts, Bitcoin is trading at the 1st resistance of $49,200 and if we break $50,000, the 2nd resistance is seen at $61,000. We have the 1st support all the way down to $45,000 & the 2nd support level could be at $41,000,” Siddharth Menon, COO of WazirX.

Bitcoin has risen and recovered after hovering in the range of $30,000 to $40,000 for many weeks. Bitcoin steeply fell from $65,000 in April to $28,800 in June, after a massive sell-off in June and July, triggered by Chinese ban on the corporates, financial companies, payment companies, providing services related to cryptocurrency. Apart from a Chinese ban imposed on the financial institutions, payment companies, a warning against speculative crypto trading also led to the massive downfall witnessed in cryptocurrency.

In July, Amazon’s job post for a digital currency and blockchain product lead led to a rise in cryptocurrencies. This move of Amazon was seen as a game-changer that could pave the way for the further legitimization of virtual currency. Apart from this, bullish comments by Tesla and Twitter chief executives Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey to incorporate digital currencies in their businesses led to a rise in cryptocurrency.

Ether, the rival currency of Bitcoin was also trading at $3328.37, up 2.07 per cent, according to coinmarketcap.com. Apart from Ethereum, Binance Coin was also trading at $480.34, up 5.14 per cent. As per coinmarketcap.com, the global crypto market cap is currently standing at $2.15 trillion, with an increase of 2.01 per cent over the last day. However, the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $105.65 billion, which makes a 2.74 per cent increase. The volume of all stable coins is now $81.27 billion, which is 76.93 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. Bitcoin’s price is currently $50,164.02. Bitcoin’s dominance is currently 43.89 per cent, a decrease of 0.07 per cent over the day.

“Traded volumes remained low, indicating the absence of a directional momentum. Markets remained positive entering the weekend, and as the markets are coming out of the weekend, this consolidation points to positive momentum. It will be an eventful week,” said Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder, Mudrex, a global crypto trading platform.

Since some positive developments are pulling up the biggest currency Bitcoin, what needs to be seen is whether the world and corporates embracing cryptocurrency going to push the Bitcoin above the $60,000 mark.

The most popular cryptocurrency has been trading in the green with a market cap of more than $921 billion.With 76 lakh users, WazirX has witnessed a massive 2,648 per cent growth in user signups from tier 2 and 3 cities in the country, observing higher participation from women from smaller towns compared to their urban counterparts.The cryptocurrency exchange has clocked $21.8 billion in overall trading volume since January 2021.'We welcome the government's move on the cryptocurrency bill and wish that cryptocurrencies will not only become available for mainstream investors but also to those who have an inclination to try the new asset class. We already have our own self-regulatory code of conduct and best practices in place for our users,' Shetty told IANS.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last week that she is awaiting an approval from the Cabinet on the bill on cryptocurrency.The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has said it may come out with a model of central bank digital currency (CBDC) as early as the end of 2021. A CBDC is a virtual currency issued by the central bank and has a sovereign backing, unlike other digital currencies.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, however, has flagged his major concerns over cryptocurrencies to the government.In its circular on April 6, 2018, the central bank had prohibited banks from dealing in cryptocurrencies or offering any such service to the customers.The circular was challenged in the Supreme Court , which set aside the rules on March 4 last year.'A digital coin by the RBI will be the key step to popularise cryptocurrencies in India,' said Shetty.'With expanding Internet access in a mobile-first country, people can start trading at ease as no bank account would be needed. The settlement period is easier, faster and 24/7 with crypto,' he added.According to him, smaller towns are fast picking up on crypto which is spreading deeper into the tier 2, 3 and 4 cities.Tier 2 and 3 cities have driven almost 55 per cent of total user signups on WazirX in 2021, overtaking tier 1 cities which demonstrated a signup growth of 2,375 per cent.Moreover, women from these regions contribute to 65 per cent of the total signups by women from all over the country.'Crypto has immense potential to remove the financial barriers for rural India, and provide cheaper access to capital, more online jobs,' Shetty noted.Crypto assets are moving towards becoming mainstream with many brands around the world accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85556232,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-105105,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrency is all the rage these days, and as it usually happens, malicious apps and hackers are here to take advantage of the ongoing crypto hype. These apps are designed to mislead innocent users into installing them on their smartphones.Google has identified eight such dangerous crypto apps on the Play Store and banned them. These apps were designed to lure innocent and unsuspecting users into installing them on their phones. These apps employed the usual “ get rich quick ” scheme to lure users into investing money in a ‘cloud mining service’ and reaping profits.“Despite these apps not being associated with cloud-mining operations or having any cryptocurrency-mining features, some of these apps prompt users to pay for increased cryptocurrency-mining capabilities via the apps’ in-app billing systems that range from $14.99 to as high as $189.99,” the Trend Micro report said.According to an analysis by security firm Trend Micro, the eight banned apps forced users to watch advertisements and have an average monthly fee of $115 (approx. ₹1,114). These apps also suggested to users that they could pay for increased mining ability by buying their favourite crypto “machines” in the cloud.“The app called Daily Bitcoin Rewards – Cloud Based Mining System prompts its users to upgrade their crypto mining capacity by “buying” their favourite mining machines to earn more coins at a faster rate,"" the report further added.What’s worse is, Trend Micro says that there are over 120 fake cryptocurrency mining apps still available. These apps have affected more than 4,500 users in the last year, according to the security research firm.If you have any of these apps installed on your phone, it is advised that you uninstall them.

It comes after the launch of the same service in the US which was then followed by a Checkout with Crypto feature, enabling PayPal users to actually spend their crypto when making purchases with online merchants.

The volatility and lack of regulation around cryptocurrencies, which are considered private money under English law, has often been seen as an impediment to their adoption by large payment companies such as PayPal.

Critics have often flagged how the potential anonymity offered by using crypto online has empowered cyber criminals and fraudsters operating on the internet.

2021-08-23,Analytics Insight,Best Cryptocurrency Mining Pools for Beginners in 2021,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/best-cryptocurrency-mining-pools-for-beginners-in-2021/,"Best Cryptocurrency Mining Pools for Beginners in 2021

Here’s an alternate way to invest in the cryptocurrency market.

Cryptocurrency has become a hot investment option and everyone is gearing up to bank on popular crypto coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, XRP, and Litecoin. While these digital tokens can be purchased from several trading platforms and exchanges, cryptocurrency mining pools are also an alternative to create cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency mining pools are groups that are operated by third parties to manage hash power from miners globally. These cryptocurrency dashboards have dashboards that can be understood by beginners and experienced miners.

How to Choose the Right Mining Pool?

Some basic criteria to look for are reputation, pool fee, uptime efficiency, location, support, and UI panel. A popular pool is often reliable and secure. Every cryptocurrency pool will require you to pay mining fees, hence it is best to opt for pools that have a high payout and low fees. Like cryptocurrencies, selecting the right mining pool also requires research. No matter where you are in the world, you should be able to operate the mining functions. Make sure to choose a pool that runs on a server that can be used globally as the response time of the device depends on it. As a beginner, facing issues with the network is common. If a pool has good support and feedback system, your queries will be solved quickly without losing precious time to mine cryptocurrencies.

Following these points, here are some of the most reliable cryptocurrency mining pools for beginners.

1. Slush Pool

Slush Pool is the oldest mining pool in existence, going a decade back to 2010. It’s a publicly available active mining pool and has a reputation for being stable and accurate. It has a smooth sign-up process and you can also create a demo miner to understand how the dashboard works. The website has two settings, one for beginners and one for experienced miners. Slush Pool also offers many features like preferences, device choice, and remote monitoring.

2. ViaBTC

ViaBTC supports many cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Dash. The services go beyond the mining pool as ViaBTC has related products like ViaWallet and cryptocurrency exchanges. With a global presence, ViaBTC offers stable payouts for miners and offers higher payouts.

3. AntPool

AntPool is the biggest mining pool in the world. It mines about 11% of all blocks and the servers work around the world. AntPool boasts an innovative peer-to-peer mining protocol that can link your device to the one that is the nearest during setup for a reliable connection.

4. BTC.com

If you are familiar with Bitcoin.com, BTC.com is owned by the same company. Before starting the mining section, BTC.com was known for its innovative Bitcoin wallet and its blockchain explorer. Mining in many geographies like Germany and the US, BTC.com has a medium-sized mining pool that supports many cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Ether, and more.

5. KanoPool

Functioning since 2014, KanoPool is a smaller pool comparatively but has low mining fees and an easy setup process. Registration is optional and the only requirement is a BTC wallet address and a username. The layout is simple, user-friendly, and has a detailed help page that has all the important FAQ answers.

6. Binance Pool

Binance Pool is powered by the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. After the success of its exchange platform and its native token Binance coin, Binance Pool is an upcoming popular platform that mines about 9% of all blocks, currently.

7. F2pool

The logic behind F2pool is that a user can contribute computing power to discover blocks. It is one of the best bitcoin mining pools and can be used for trading Bitcoins as well. F2pool supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and offers live chat support.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency-Mining-Pools.jpg',)",none

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reached as high as $50,152.24, the highest since mid-May, up 2.5%.

Bitcoin has recovered after trading in a range of about $30,000 to $40,000 for many weeks, after it plunged from a record near $65,000 in mid-April. Still, it’s up significantly in the past year.

As per CoinDesk, Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, surged to $3,321. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was trading at $0.32, up 1%. Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also were trading with gains over the last 24 hours.

The worldwide crypto adoption grew by 880% between June 2020 and July 2021, according to the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain data platform Chainalysis. India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption worldwide behind Vietnam, but ahead of countries such as the US, UK, and China, as per the report.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped Bitcoin rally.

In another news, PayPal Holdings Inc will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week. The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class, reported Reuters.

The total market value of cryptocurrencies was at $2.17 trillion on Sunday, according to data from CoinGecko.com, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The overall value has been helped in the past seven days by the 18% rally in Cardano and Binance Coin’s 11% gain, while Dogecoin is up about 9% over the period and Solana 73%, CoinGecko pricing showed.

The digital coin rose above that level around 10:40 p.m. ET on Sunday, according to data from Coin Metrics. It last traded at $49,471.77 at 4:55 p.m. ET on Monday.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high over $64,000 in April but sold off heavily in June and July, even dipping below $30,000. One of the major reasons was renewed regulatory scrutiny from Chinese authorities which has forced bitcoin mining operations to shut down and move elsewhere.

But since mid-July, bitcoin has been on a steady rise.

In the last few days, two key announcements have been positive for the cryptocurrency space.

Cryptocurrency prices continue to be in the red on August 23. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $2.13 trillion, a 1.37 percent increase over the last day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $93.71 billion, which makes a 13.09 percent decrease.

2021-08-23,NDTV Gadgets 360,"What Are Cryptocurrencies? Making Sense of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ether, and the Rest",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/opinion/what-are-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-dogecoin-ether-2514871,"To understand cryptocurrency, you need to understand how money works, and what makes these new assets useful, and potentially also usable as currency in the future. First, there was ""physical"" money - notes and coins. Then came e-Money - the numbers that show in your e-banking apps. Both these are issued by the Government.

And then came cryptocurrency, a type of electronic money that is not issued by any Government. It is also called Math Money because it is created and managed using blockchains which are computer networks powered by advanced mathematics. Today, the use case for cryptocurrency is mostly its value as an asset, while the underlying blockchain technology is already powering a number of applications. But the future of money could look very different.

1. What is blockchain?

Let's say Svetlana borrows 10,000 Rupees from me. She is supposed to return it in a week but doesn't. I remind her but she has conveniently ""forgotten"" about it. What can I do? Nothing, except never lending her anything ever again! True story.

Now suppose, at the time of lending the money, a few friends are present. They all clicked a pic or shot a video of me lending Svetlana the money and her promising to return it in a week. And each of these friends posts the pic/ video on Instagram, Facebook, etc. Now that is solid evidence. And Svetlana can't really delete all these videos/ pics from the Internet.

Now that's something like a blockchain.

A blockchain is typically a bunch of computers (nodes) connected to each other. All of these computers contain the same information (e.g. a ledger of transactions). To ""hack"" this information, you will need to ""hack"" most of these computers at the same time. And that's a pretty tough thing to do!

There are many blockchains in the world. The Bitcoin Blockchain is the first and oldest one. It records all transactions of the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Anyone can run a node of this blockchain. All you need is a computer with enough storage space and a strong Internet connection.

2. How are cryptocurrencies created?

There are 2 common ways of creating crypto-currencies. One is the style used by Bitcoin and the other is the style used by Ethereum.

In the Bitcoin-style, there are a bunch of computers called miners who are constantly trying to solve mathematical puzzles. Roughly every 10 minutes, one of these miners wins this race to solve the puzzle. This miner wins a reward which is currently 6.25 bitcoins. That's about Rs. 2 crores. Yes, you read that right. Every 10 minutes there is someone getting 2 Crores worth of bitcoin.

But don't get too jealous of these miners. They have to spend tons of money on computers and electricity. And they can never be sure how much they will actually end up earning.

Many years ago anyone could mine or create bitcoins using a laptop! Well, not anymore. Today you need a ton of computing power for this. In case you want to understand this concept of mining in all its complicated tech glory, you can download the free Future Money Playbook that I have written.

In the Ethereum-style, you can create your own crypto in minutes. My daughters were quite fed up hearing about Dogecoin. So they decided to create their own cat-based cryptocurrency. All they needed to do was customize a ""smart contract"" and publish it to the Ethereum blockchain. That's it! In a few minutes, they had created a new cryptocurrency with a supply of 7 billion tokens - one for each human on Earth. True story.

3. What are the types of cryptocurrencies?

There are 3 common types of cryptos - medium of exchange, utility coin, and stablecoins.

A medium of exchange crypto can be used to buy and sell stuff. Examples are Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Monero. These are the types that Governments hate. That's because they can be used by criminals. But hey, criminals can also use cash! So it's a little unfair to blame these poor little cryptos.

Then there are utility coins. Just like oil ""fuels"" the global economy, utility coins, like Ether, ""fuel"" blockchain-based businesses.

And finally, there are stablecoins. These are backed by normal fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Japanese Yen.

4. Numbers don't lie

The world's first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin (BTC). It is a medium of exchange crypto with a total worth of more than $880 billion. And the world's largest bank, JP Morgan Chase is worth $470 billion.

The world's most popular utility coin is Ether (ETH) with a total worth of $377 billion. India's largest bank, HDFC Bank, pales in comparison with a total worth of $140.37 billion.

Tether (USDT) is the most popular stablecoin with a total worth of $64 billion. Doesn't seem much? Well, that's also the size of ICICI Bank!

2021-08-23,CNN,"For the crypto world, bipartisan infrastructure package brings a 'political awakening'",https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/22/politics/crypto-political-awakening-infrastructure-package/index.html,"Washington, DC (CNN) Members of the cryptocurrency world are donating to crypto-focused organizations, hiring lobbyists and ramping up advocacy efforts in a push to get lawmakers on board with the industry, as pressure builds on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to address a cryptocurrency provision of the bipartisan infrastructure bill before a vote in the House.

""The crypto world has been made politically aware,"" said Anne Fauvre-Willis, chief operating officer at Oasis Labs, a blockchain privacy company. ""For many there has been a personal political awakening.""

The push follows a back-and-forth debate between Senators and dueling amendment proposals earlier this month that would have modified language included in the bipartisan infrastructure package meant to regulate cryptocurrency -- which uses blockchain technology for online transactions.

Despite the debate, a cryptocurrency language compromise amendment failed before final passage of the legislation in the chamber Tuesday, leaving crypto advocates concerned for the fate of an industry they are personally invested in and care deeply about.

As it stands, the provision would impose more federal regulation on cryptocurrencies and could dramatically expand the number of cryptocurrency users who would have to report filings to the Internal Revenue Service -- something that has struck a nerve with supporters of an industry designed to take out intermediaries and grant autonomy to its users via a decentralized system.

While a small number of advocates with cryptocurrency think tanks and associations have been making noise in DC for years, leaders in the crypto space told CNN that the recent debate over cryptocurrency regulations on Capitol Hill caught the attention of thousands of people who were previously disengaged from politics.

""There is a whole new swath of people paying attention to what's happening in Washington,"" said Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, a cryptocurrency research and analysis firm.

Like Fauvre-Willis, Selkis told CNN the conversation around cryptocurrency in DC prompted an ""awakening for many people.""

The birth of the 'crypto voter'

Since early August, the phrase ""I am now a single issue voter,"" has gone viral among crypto circles on Twitter, flooding the feeds of both high profile crypto leaders and ordinary traders who have racked up thousands of likes and hundreds of retweets for sharing that they will only vote for candidates supportive of the booming industry.

Selkis' own Twitter bio reads, ""single issue voter: anti-crypto politicians should be afraid.""

But according to members of the crypto community, while ""crypto voters"" may prioritize protecting the booming industry, they don't yet belong to one party or the other.

For her part, Evan Greer, who for the past decade has organized large-scale online protests in support of net neutrality and in opposition of internet censorship and government surveillance, said that in her experience, ""Tech issues often fall outside of the historical Democrat vs. Republican partisan divide.""

""These are fundamental issues, about how people orient toward institutions of power whether that's corporate power or government power,"" Greer -- director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights nonprofit -- told CNN.

""Among young folks especially, there is skyrocketing skepticism about arbitrary forms of power, either from the government or corporations, and we see that play out in the crypto community,"" Greer said. ""The traditional left-right party politics that have dominated US politics for young people are really starting to erode.""

Push to protect crypto industry goes beyond social media

Earlier this month, 25 new companies have expressed interest in joining the Blockchain Association -- a trade association with 46 existing member companies that works to educate lawmakers on and improve public policy around cryptocurrency.

""This is a pivotal moment for the crypto ecosystem because it was the first time that so many people have in a unified way reached out to the Senate [and lawmakers] and let them know this is a super vibrant, super creative group,"" said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.

In recent months, the Blockchain Association beefed up its lobbying operation, Smith, who has been with the association for three years, told CNN. The group has an internal Republican lobbyist, internal Democratic lobbyist and three lobbying firms on retainer.

Smith, who is also registered to lobby, told CNN that member companies are now hiring lobbyists or lobbying firms too.

Asked why those unfamiliar with the crypto space may care about the recent cryptocurrency advocacy push, Smith said it comes down to a belief in the benefit of having autonomy over one's financial transactions.

""Even if you don't understand the tech [behind crypto], the ability to use your money and data in the way that you want to use it and to have a digital life where you're not at the mercy of intermediaries is something that should be attractive to a lot of people,"" she said.

Coin Center, a think tank started in 2014 that focuses on cryptocurrency policy, has seen ""a surge"" in donations both from individuals and corporations, Neeraj Agrawal, the organization's director of communications, told CNN.

Since August 1, the organization has received gifts from more than 350 individual donors, he said.

And Fight for the Future -- which directed more than 40,000 people to their online portal to call to Senators earlier this month, urging the lawmakers to scale back the proposed cryptocurrency regulations -- has since received more than $20,000 in donations to their organization, mostly given in cryptocurrency.

Creators and users of cryptocurrency, ""have now woken up to the fact that government can kick down your door and shut down your cool project,"" Greer said.

""Any lawmaker that wants to get support from young voters needs to show they aren't utterly ignorant about these issues,"" Greer said.

Fight for the Future will use the donations to support the push to protect crypto in the infrastructure bill, which is moving toward the House of Representatives, Greer said.

The organization will launch a ""full court press"" operation, Greer said, requesting meetings with lawmakers, driving more phone calls and emails to legislators and creating educational videos and explainers.

""All of that costs money,"" she said.","('https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210809123837-crypto-phone-super-tease.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,ABC News,"What to know about 'stablecoins,' the 'bridge' between cryptocurrencies and traditional money",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/stablecoins-bridge-cryptocurrencies-traditional-money/story?id=79500575,"In the exploding realm of cryptocurrencies, a new line of financial products has emerged that has caught the attention of both investors and regulators -- so-called ""stablecoins,"" which are backed by cash or another reserve asset.

Stablecoins seek to provide the best of both worlds: the stability of a traditional government-backed currency as well as the privacy and convenience offered by crypto transactions. They are often marketed towards investors who may not have the stomach for the volatility associated with Bitcoin, Ethereum and other popular cryptos -- which have been known to see-saw widely in value on a day-to-day basis.

The existing stablecoins market is worth some $113 billion, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said earlier this month during a speech at the Aspen Security Forum. He added that in July, nearly three-quarters of trading on all crypto trading platforms occurred between a stablecoin and some other token.

Even social media behemoth Facebook is trying to get in on the action, seeking to launch a stablecoin-like project of its own of its own after its initial Libra cryptocurrency efforts fizzled.

As their popularity rises, stablecoins have also recently drawn new scrutiny from authorities and regulators. Federal Reserve officials mulled over the threats posed by ""new financial arrangements such as stablecoins"" in a recent meeting, according to a readout released earlier this week, raising concerns over the lack of transparency and regulations.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last month also called on regulators to ""act quickly"" in forming new regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, raising alarms over their ""potential risks to end-users, the financial system, and national security.""

Here is what experts say investors should know about the novel class of cryptos dominating headlines in recent weeks.

What are stablecoins?

Stablecoins are essentially cryptocurrencies that are backed by a reserve asset -- usually a traditional currency such as the U.S. dollar. The valuations of stablecoins are therefore supposed to be less volatile than other digital currencies, because they are pegged directly to a fixed, non-virtual currency.

""Think of stablecoin as a cryptocurrency without, or with limited, volatility. That is the best way to think about it,"" Haran Segram, a professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business, told ABC News, adding they are sometimes looked at as ""the bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies."" Fiat currencies are traditional currencies like the dollar, backed by the government.

""Stablecoins are backed by other central bank currencies,"" Segram explained.

Bryan Routledge, an associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, added that this makes stablecoins more useful as an everyday currency.

""For example, the price of Bitcoin is just stunningly volatile,"" he told ABC News. ""That makes it harder to use as a currency."" In 2021 alone, Bitcoin's value has seen swings of 100% -- starting the year at a price of less than $30,000, reaching a peak of over $63,000 in April, before receding back to the $30,000 mark in July. As of Friday, Bitcoin was trading at a little over $46,000.

""When I tell you a latte cost $2.50, you know what that means -- but if I quote a price of a latte in Bitcoin, it's just really hard to keep track of because one day it's the equivalent of $2.50, the next day it's equivalent to $25,"" he added.

Pegging cryptocurrencies to a fixed exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar, as stablecoins attempt to do, makes them ""more useful as a currency,"" according to Routledge.

'It's a stablecoin because they call it a stablecoin'

While this may sound like an overall positive development for everyday investors interested in crypto, experts and authorities have warned of lurking risks associated with the largely unchecked stablecoin market.

Segram noted that one of the most popular stablecoins out there is Tether, which claims to be backed one-to-one to the U.S. dollar.

""The issue with that is some research was done into that, and then actually they found that one unit of that stablecoin is backed by .74 of the U.S. dollar,"" Segram said. ""So things like that, what people put out saying it's a stablecoin, it might not be truly a stablecoin.""

""That's something that investors and your audience should be aware of,"" he told ABC News. ""Because people don't know exactly what's happening in the background, and I would really encourage your readers to be aware of that.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office led an investigation into Tether that said there were periods of time when Tether did not have access to banking and ""held no reserves to back tethers in circulation at the rate of one dollar for every tether, contrary to its representations."" As part of a settlement reached with James’ office, Tether is barred from doing business with New Yorkers but admitted no wrongdoing and pledged increased transparency. The Hong Kong-based entity still maintains on its website, however, that Tether tokens are ""100% backed by Tether’s reserves"" at a conversion rate of one Tether token equaling one U.S. dollar.

""Under the terms of the settlement, we admit no wrongdoing,"" Tether said in a statement on its website in response to the investigation. ""The settlement amount we have agreed to pay to the Attorney General’s Office should be viewed as a measure of our desire to put this matter behind us and focus on our business."" The company added that it is pleased by the ""loyalty"" customers have shown, saying that the market capitalization of tethers grew from $2 billion to an excess of $34 billion during the past two years, while the investigation was ongoing.

""Tether is complicated because it's an international business,"" Routledge added in regards to who regulates it. ""Cryptocurrencies, one of their either charms or weak points, is they don't sort of fall under anybody's direct jurisdiction.""

For most stablecoins, ""it's a stablecoin because they call it a stablecoin,"" Routledge added.

Despite assurances of cash reserves, there is a risk that some stablecoins might operate under the assumption that the likelihood of having to liquidate all at once is slim if confidence remains high.

""If everybody thinks Tether is going to be a stablecoin, it will work as a stablecoin and the few people that need to exchange it at the 'Tether store,' to be colloquial, would do that,"" he said. ""The trouble with that policy is that you can get what the foreign exchange economists would call like a speculative attack, which is that we don't think Tether has enough money, and I think everybody thinks that, they're all going to show up and demand those currencies -- It's a bit like a run on the bank.""

""That's what makes it really hard to stabilize, because your credibility as a stablecoin is the thing that makes it stable, and that's inherently flighty,"" he said.

Why the Fed and Yellen are so concerned about stablecoins

Yellen's calls for quick action on creating regulatory frameworks for stablecoins have been echoed by other lawmakers.

Stablecoins were also recently debated by Fed officials, who ""highlighted the fragility and the general lack of transparency associated with stablecoins,"" at their most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. ""The importance of monitoring them closely, and the need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework to address any risks to financial stability associated with such products.""

Segram said that while stablecoins can ""regulate themselves to some extent by being transparent with the public, I think Yellen is calling for more top-down regulations rather than let it be voluntary.""

This could mean having the reserve currency kept somewhere independent, or having claims be regularly audited, he added.

Segram added that the Fed, meanwhile, might have other concerns around stablecoins' growth.

""If stablecoins become popular, the central bank loses its control,"" Segram said, noting that there have been discussions of stablecoin-like ""Central Bank Digital Currency"" to be issued by the Federal Reserve.

A Central Bank Digital Currency would give the Fed more control ""over how we manage demand, supply and all other means,"" Segram said.

Routledge added that the Fed may also have worries about a ""banking panic"" situation if a lot of assets are flowing through a specific stablecoin.

""If for whatever reason that stablecoin has a shock to it -- that can be a systemic event to the financial system,"" he added. ""That is what's on the Fed's radar.""

SEC Chair Gensler, meanwhile, signaled a regulation crackdown could be looming during his remarks earlier this month in Aspen.

Gensler said the use of stablecoins on crypto trading platforms ""may facilitate those seeking to sidestep a host of public policy goals connected to our traditional banking and financial system: anti-money laundering, tax compliance, sanctions, and the like.""

""This affects our national security, too,"" he added. Gensler said he looks forward to working with regulators and lawmakers on these matters.

Despite the risks, Segram sees cryptocurrencies as the future, which may be in part why regulators are raising alarm bells and why there is so much discussion over a potential central bank digital currency. Major U.S. companies including Amazon and Walmart have recently announced they are hiring cryptocurrency experts, and a growing number of firms have started accepting cryptos as a form of payment.

China's central bank has already launched its digital Yuan, he added, saying that the U.S. most likely will at some point in if it does not want to lose its status as the ""reserve currency of the world.""

""If a stablecoin is issued by a private authority, it is not 100% fail-proof,"" he said. ""In a democracy like ours, or other democracies where there's some political stability and currency stability, a central bank digital currency might be the way to go.""

""I think of stablecoin sort of as a link between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, this takes that to another level,"" he said.","('https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/money-illustration-rf-gty-jc-210820_1629489806353_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg',)",none

NEW DELHI: Cardano, a relatively lesser-known cryptocurrency, has raced to the top three. In its dash to the top, Cardano (ADA) has made a stunning recovery from a $1 trillion crash and occupies the third place after Bitcoin and Ethereum.Cardano’s rise to the top has happened at a time predicted to be a ‘quiet one’ by market analysts. By Friday morning, Cardano (ADA) completed the week-long run registering 10 percent growth. This in terms of crypto gains is a formidable and matchless run.Its volumes swelled on the back of a software upgrade that could help the currency to stand next to Ethereum which is only second to Bitcoin.According to Coindesk, the digital coin hit an all-time high Friday of $2.58, an increase of more than 18 percent. Year to date, it has seen returns of 1,294 per cent recording a recovery of $82 billion, in the process surpassing Binance coin and securing the third position.This unprecedented rally may again continue following the update that is expected sometime on September 12. This phase will allow smart contract functionality and for a range of decentralized finance applications to be used on the Cardano network.Smart contract functions have been the strong points of any cryptocurrency and will continue to be so, for a longer period until an alternative is found to better the trading experience and exchange.Smart contracts are a way to ensure agreements can be validated securely. Ethereum has already arrived at that point and that is said to be its biggest strength.Another upgrade is on the cards when Cardano moves into the third phase known as Goguen . Enough space has been created in this phase to include Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens.It must be recalled that Cardano was founded by the co-founder of Ethereum, Hoskinson four years ago, and if there is anybody in the world of cryptocurrency who knows the major takeaways of Ethereum vis-à-vis Cardano, it is Hoskinson.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85533972,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-301800,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

It was clearly the week of altcoins surging way past the cryptocurrency market formen Bitcoin and Ethereum to make a substantial mark. While Bitcoin ($49,235) saw a 7-day rise of 5.67 percent and Ethereum ($3,236) rose just 0.03 percent in the same time, altcoins like Cardano ($2.53) recorded a weekly jump of 17.47 percent, along with Cardano ($2.53) which spiked 17.47 percent, Polkadot ($27.72) which peaked 23.02 percent, Solana ($74.52), which rose almost 64.85 percent and Terra ($27.94), which hiked 63.44 percent.

Winds of Change

In fact, Cardano, with a current market cap of 80,559,983,767 dollars overtook Binance Coin’s market capitalization ($75,750,693,612) as the third biggest cryptocurrency after Ethereum and Bitcoin. This is mostly thanks to its upcoming Alonzo upgrade, which will incorporate smart contracts, opening a range of applications like DeFi, NFTs, automated lending, and more and giving stiff competition to peers like Ethereum.

Closer home, crypto adoption in India is exponentially growing, with the country ranking second, succeeded by Vietnam amidst the countries that make a lion’s share of cryptocurrency usage, with 9 percent of the respondents claiming to utilize cryptocurrency, per market research firm Finder.

In fact, all five leading nations in terms of bitcoin ownership are located in Asia. Bitcoin (16 percent) is the most popular coin, followed by Ethereum and Bitcoin cash (6 percent) and Ripple (8 percent). While men (32 percent) take precedence over women (23 percent) in terms of possession, young adults (32 percent) aged between 18-24 when it comes to cryptocurrency ownership. Young adults lead the way with 32% of those aged 18-24 have invested in cryptocurrency.

Regulatory woes to end?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clarified the government’s stand on cryptocurrency, stating that the area has a lot of potential in terms of fuelling the country’s fintech sector. Notably, the work on the pending cryptocurrency regulation bill is nearly complete and the cabinet will decide further, with chances of it being presented in the winter parliament session

""We cannot be moving ahead as if this doesn't exist. We are not saying no to cryptocurrency. We are saying we will have to see how this technology can help fintech to maximize the potential it has. But how sophisticated regulation can be is something which I want to work with the RBI,"" she elaborated.

The necessity of regulations in this field, however, was highlighted in the recent case of cryptocurrencies worth 97 million dollars being stolen from the digital currency wallets of Liquid, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange. In the meantime, all deposits and withdrawals on the platform have been suspended.

""Future growth of Terra may be capped given impending regulations around stablecoins,"" he added.Polygon, which was founded by three Indians, has delivered over 4,300 per cent returns in the last one year. It has the potential to grow along with Ethereum , and a strong growth from current levels is possible in the next year, Subburaj said.Cardano and Solana have gained 1,400-2,000 per cent returns in the last one year.Nair of CoinSwitch Kuber says the recent craze over non-fungible tokens has brought these coins to a more mainstream market. ""Coins like these will experience a continuous surge in the coming days and investors will be in a good position,"" he adds.Among the behemoths, Ethereum has given a stellar returns of 770 per cent in the last one year.

2021-08-23,Yahoo Finance,"Ethereum Classic Stops For Gas, Along With Bitcoin And Doge, On Bullish Moon Trip",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-classic-stops-gas-along-145939300.html,"On Saturday morning Ethereum Classic (CRYPTO: ETC), along with apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and the ever-popular Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), was consolidating Friday’s bullish trek north. All three cryptos have recently had a relative strength index (RSI) of over 70% which puts them into overbought conditions for technical traders.

A cryptocurrency, like a stock, always enters into a period of consolidation after either a large incline or decline. Ethereum Classic rose 137% between its June 22 low of $32.17 and its Aug. 15 high of $77.37. Although bulls would love to see the original Ethereum version ‘moon’ it will need to stop for gas along the way.

The Ethereum Classic Chart: On Aug. 7 Ethereum Classic broke up from a descending trendline that had been holding the crypto down since June 3. After busting up through the trendline Ethereum Classic soared about 46% over the course of nine days.

When the crypto reached its $77 high its relative strength index measured in at 79% which was a sell signal. The crypto then retraced about 22%, which cooled its RSI down to a much more comfortable 57%, before making another bullish move up.

In its consolidation Ethereum Classic has created another descending trendline which it has now rejected on four separate trading days. For technical traders a trendline must demonstrate support or rejection at least three times to be valid. Ethereum Classic rejected from its new trendline on Aug. 15, 16 and 20 and on Saturday morning the crypto tried to jump over it but failed.

As of 10:00 a.m. ET Ethereum Classic’s trading volume was about 143 million compared to its average 10-day volume of 547 million. When a crypto or stock trades down on low volume it is usually a bullish consolidation as opposed to a bear break.

Ethereum Classic is trading over the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending above the 21-day, both of which are bullish indicators. On Saturday morning the crypto tested the eight-day as support and held above it. Ethereum Classic is also trading above the 200-day simple moving average indicating overall sentiment is bullish.

Story continues

Bulls want to see big bullish volume come in and drive Ethereum Classic up over the descending trendline. If the crypto can clear the level it has resistance above at about $72 and $79.

Bears want to see big bearish volume come in and drop the crypto down below support at the eight-day EMA. If Ethereum Classic loses the support level it could fall toward $65. Below that there is support near the $57 mark. etc_aug._21.png

2021-08-23,NDTV.com,"Here's How You Can Invest In Bitcoin, Ethereum, Other Crypto Coins In India",https://www.ndtv.com/business/crytocurrency-in-india-heres-how-you-can-invest-in-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-other-coins-in-india-2515676,"In India, some popular exchanges are WazirX, CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Cryptocurrency has become a lucrative financial asset for investors these days with its scope to provide steady returns, despite its volatile nature. Being a form of a digital asset, cryptocurrency is primarily based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. The decentralized structure of the virtual currency allows it to exist without the control of governments or regulation of any central authority.

Ever since billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla Inc invested in the world's largest cryptocurrency- bitcoin, leading crypto coins such as ethereum, dogecoin, and bitcoin have caught the attention of the bigger investors as well as the common man.

In India, many are still advocating the classification of cryptocurrency as an asset. Recently, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the cabinet note on the cryptocurrency bill is ready and the Cabinet is yet to clear the same. Presently, cryptocurrencies are under no regulation in the country, which often makes it risky for investors.

However, one must know the basic steps of investing in cryptocurrency. Here is how you can invest in crypto coins such as bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin in India:

Step 1: Find the right crypto exchange

Since there is no established structure for trading in cryptocurrency yet, crypto exchanges are the platforms where people can buy and sell their digital assets. In India, some of the more popular exchanges are WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Step 2: Create an account

After selecting the crypto exchange for trading, create your account on the platform. After creating an account, select the amount you plan to invest, what you seek to invest. Read all policies of the platform carefully. The platform will ask for the submission of documents as proof in order to prevent any fraudulent activities.



Step 3: Set up the account for trading

One needs to have money in the account before buying cryptocurrencies. The money can be transferred from one's bank account to a particular exchange account. Upon transferring funds, make sure that both accounts are linked.

Step 4: Making the investment

After the accounts are linked and the crypto exchange account has money, one needs to select which coin they want to invest in. The world's biggest and most popular cryptocurrency is bitcoin, followed by ethereum by market cap. Other leading coins include tether, dogecoin, XRP, cardano, binance coin. After purchasing, make sure you store codes to the account, to protect it from risks such as hacking. Experts advise storing the coins purchased in a crypto wallet.



Latest prices:



On Saturday, August 21, bitcoin was last trading 3.26 per cent higher at $48,707.8 against the US dollar. Ethereum - the world's second-largest cryptocurrency was last up 1.15 per cent higher at $3,273.60 against the American currency.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/ogfsfjs8_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,Inside Afghanistan's cryptocurrency underground as the country plunges into turmoil,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/21/bitcoin-afghanistan-cryptocurrency-taliban-capital-flight.html,"Crypto trader and vlogger Farhan Hotak traveling to the Shah Wali Kot District in Afghanistan.

Farhan Hotak isn't your typical 22 year-old Afghan. In the last week, he helped his family of ten flee the province of Zabul in southern Afghanistan and travel 97 miles to a city on the Pakistani border. But unlike others choosing to leave the country, once his relatives were in safe hands, Hotak then turned around and came back so that he could protect his family home – and vlog to his thousands of Instagram followers about the evolving situation on the ground in Afghanistan. He has also been keeping a very close eye on his crypto portfolio on Binance, as the local currency touches record lows and nationwide bank closures make it next to impossible to withdraw cash. ""In Afghanistan, we don't have platforms like PayPal, Venmo, or Zelle, so I have to depend on other things,"" said Hotak. Afghanistan still mostly operates as a cash economy, so money in Hotak's crypto wallet won't help him put dinner on his table tonight, but it does give him peace of mind that some of his wealth is safeguarded against economic instability at home. It also offers bigger promises down the road: Access to the global economy from inside Afghanistan, certain protections against spiraling inflation, and crucially, the opportunity to make a bet on himself and a future he didn't think was possible before learning about bitcoin. ""I have very, very, very limited resources to do anything. I'm interested in the crypto world, because I have earned a lot, and I see a lot of potential in myself that I can go further,"" he said.

Run on the banks

For many Afghans, this week has laid bare the worst-case scenario for a country running on legacy financial rails: A nationwide cash shortage, closed borders, a plunging currency, and rapidly rising prices of basic goods. Many banks were forced to shutter their doors after running out of cash this week. Photos featuring hundreds of Kabul residents crowding outside branches in a futile effort to draw money from their accounts went viral.

""There's no bank I can go to right now, no ATM,"" said Ali Latifi, a journalist born and based in Kabul. ""I live above two banks and three ATM machines, but they've been off since Thursday,"" said Latifi, referring to the Thursday before the palace ouster. Without an authority helming the Central Bank, it appears that printing cash to cover the shortfall isn't an option, at least in the short-term. The Western Union has suspended all services and even the centuries-old ""hawala"" system – which facilitates cross-border transactions via a sophisticated network of money exchangers and personal contacts – for now, remains closed.

Sangar Paykhar, a Kabul native currently living in the Netherlands, has been in constant touch with relatives there in recent weeks. He said that many who live paycheck to paycheck were, at first, borrowing money from others to get by, but now, those able to lend out cash have started conserving their funds. ""They've realized the regime has collapsed"" and that those they are lending to ""might not have a job tomorrow,"" said Paykhar. A few days before the Taliban entered Kabul, Musa Ramin was among the people who queued outside a bank in a fruitless attempt to withdraw cash. But unlike other Afghans in line with him that day, months earlier, he had invested a portion of his net worth into crypto. Ramin had been burned before by a rapidly depreciating currency, and decentralized digital money had proven to be a trusted safeguard. In 2020, on what was meant to be a brief layover on a trip from London to Kabul, Ramin got stuck in Turkey. A one-week, mandatory Covid quarantine ballooned into six months. ""I converted all my money to the lira,"" he said. After the Turkish currency began to spiral, Ramin said his capital was cut in half, and he was forced to conserve it. ""That is when I discovered bitcoin."" With all flights cancelled and no other options for departure, Ramin realized he needed to find alternative ways to support himself while stranded in Turkey during the pandemic-related shutdown. That's when he started trading crypto. ""At first, I lost a lot of money,"" he said. But he's since gotten the swing of managing his digital assets, thanks to Twitter and tutorials on YouTube.

Even after returning to Kabul, the 27 year-old says he put all his focus into trading crypto. 80% of his crypto capital is in spot exposure, primarily in major coins, like bitcoin, ethereum, and binance coin. The other 20% he uses to trade futures. ""I was making more money in crypto in a month than in construction in a year,"" said Ramin, though he did acknowledge the risk that's involved. ""It's easy making money in crypto but keeping that wealth is the difficult part."" Despite that volatility, Ramin still sees crypto as the safest place to park his cash. ""If a government isn't formed quickly, we might see a Venezuela-type situation here,"" Ramin told CNBC. He feels virtual tokens are his safest hedge against political uncertainty and plans to increase his exposure to digital currencies in the coming year to as much as 40% of his total net worth.

Ramin isn't alone in his thinking. Google trends data shows that web searches in Afghanistan for ""bitcoin"" and ""crypto"" rose sharply in July just before the coup in Kabul. That said, because this tool is a measure of interest, the spike could be referring to 10 searches or it could be 100,000. But in a country that has long relied on physical cash for virtually all transactions, not many people have the option to let their savings sit in a bank account, let alone a digital wallet. Just take Hotak. He lives in a remote part of Afghanistan where there are no ATMs or bank branches nearby. That means he has to keep a lot of physical cash on hand, in order to cover daily expenses. ""Afghanistan is an unexpected country, and you have to be ready for anything,"" he said. While Hotak thinks that crypto is his future, for now, the bulk of his income comes from day labor jobs, like shoveling, brick work, digging wells, and running a tailor shop that makes clothes.



""Zabul is not a very developed city. It's a village, so that's how I earn,"" he said.

Signs of a growing crypto economy

It's hard to get insight into crypto adoption in Afghanistan. Beyond the fact that measuring cryptocurrency adoption at the grassroots level isn't easy, people actively go out of their way to hide who they are. Some Afghans, for example, will conceal their IP address by using a virtual private network, or VPN, in order to mask their geographic digital footprint. And unlike many crypto boosters – who tend to be vocal and community-driven – digital currency supporters inside Afghanistan often don't want others to know they exist. ""The crypto community in Afghanistan is very small,"" said Hotak. ""They actually don't want to meet each other."" He thinks that could change if the political situation normalizes, but ""for now, everyone just wants to stay hidden until things are nice."" However, new research from blockchain data firm Chainalysis is offering fresh optics on the country's apparently burgeoning peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto network, which is increasingly the most telling metric of adoption in Afghanistan. Hotak, as well as his friends, use Binance's P2P exchange, which allows them to buy and sell their coins directly with other users on the platform.

Chainalysis' 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index gives Afghanistan a rank of 20 out of the 154 countries it evaluated in terms of overall crypto adoption. And when you isolate for its P2P exchange trade volume, Afghanistan jumps up to seventh place. That's a big move in just 12 months: Last year, Chainalysis considered Afghanistan's crypto presence to be so minimal as to entirely exclude it from its 2020 ranking. ""Afghanistan on top makes sense from a capital controls point of view, given it's hard to move money in and out,"" explained Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst. And some experts tell CNBC that Chainalysis could actually be underestimating its overall adoption. ""Unlike many other countries, sanctioned nations don't have good and clear data on P2P markets,"" explained Sobrado. He says that is partly to do with the fact that it is harder to track those transactions.

There are other anecdotal signs of adoption across the country. Nearly a decade ago, sisters and Afghan entrepreneurs Elaha and Roya – both of whom had a focus on computer science at Herat University – founded the Digital Citizen Fund, an NGO that helps women and girls in developing countries gain access to technology. The organization has 11 women-only IT centers in Herat and another two in Kabul, where they teach 16,000 females everything from essential computer skills to blockchain technology. Before classes were suspended earlier this week, creating a crypto wallet was also part of the curriculum. Elaha Mahboob tells CNBC that some students have chosen to secure their money in crypto accounts and a few have specifically started investing in bitcoin and ethereum in order to achieve their long-term financial goals. ""This is especially important as they don't have to worry about not having access to their money, because major banks in Afghanistan have closed,"" Mahboob said. A few Digital Citizen Fund participants have left the country and used the crypto accounts they made in class as a way to transfer their money out. Afghanistan's exposure to the cryptosphere was also taking place inside the presidential palace. Blockchain company Fantom told CNBC it had been working in tandem with the previous government. One such project with the Ministry of Health involved piloting blockchain technology to track counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Fantom says the pilot ""concluded successfully,"" and they had been preparing for national rollout before the Taliban took over. Then there's Sweden-based Bitrefill, an online marketplace that helps customers live on cryptocurrency by exchanging digital coins like bitcoin or dogecoin for gift cards with partner merchants. In Afghanistan, the card offerings include multiple mobile phone service providers, games such as Fortnite and Minecraft, Hotels.com, and Flightgift, which can be redeemed for flights with 300 international airlines. While the company wouldn't share sales numbers on the record with CNBC, Bitrefill does have the endorsement of Janey Gak, who uses it to top up her phone. Her Twitter account has become a must-follow for those who want to understand the situation on the ground through her eyes, but she's also evangelizing the power of bitcoin to transform the country. ""I'm just an ordinary person. I'm not anyone special,"" she said. ""I am just someone who discovered bitcoin a couple of years ago."" In 2018, Gak — who goes by the name ""Bibi Janey"" — started a Facebook page as a hobby to see what Afghans thought of bitcoin. ""I remember getting a lot of comments and questions like, 'Can you explain more?'"" she said. ""People would be fascinated by it, but they would be so confused."" She also got lots of questions about where to buy bitcoin. Since entering this world, she has learned how to code and reads as much as she can about bitcoin. ""I don't trade, I don't do any of that,"" she said. ""I just make some money here and there and save it in bitcoin."" Through her research, she's come to the conclusion that in order for Afghanistan to be a truly sovereign state, it must never borrow money – and adopt a bitcoin standard. To foment wider adoption, Gak commissions articles to be translated to local languages. ""It's not much, but it's a start,"" she told CNBC.

DIY crypto rails

The on-ramp to participating in the crypto economy in Afghanistan is complicated and there are still multiple barriers to entry. Access to the internet, while growing, remains low. There were 8.64 million internet users in Afghanistan in January 2021, according to DataReportal.com and internet penetration stood at 22%. Unreliable electricity poses another major issue, as power outages are common. ""Power goes out once every day for a couple of hours,"" said Ramin, though he noted that it happens in some parts of Kabul more often than others. When CNBC first spoke to Hotak, he was seated near one of the land-crossings into Pakistan, tapping into a WiFi network across the border. ""We don't have proper internet on the Afghanistan side,"" he explained. Hotak also uses solar power to charge his phone, given the country's long-standing issue with electricity outages. Electricity and a stable internet connection are two essential rails for widespread crypto adoption. Also critical is having access to some form of online banking or a credit card that is recognized internationally – which again, poses a big problem for many Afghans. Eighty-five percent of the country is unbanked, according to one U.N. estimate, meaning they do not have a bank account. So people wishing to deal in crypto have to get creative. Hotak and some of his contacts enlist the help of family and friends in neighboring Pakistan or across the Gulf of Oman in the United Arab Emirates, where they have easier access to global markets. ""It's very easy in Pakistan,"" he said. ""Most people have relatives in Dubai, who buy crypto for them using their credit cards."" When the person then wants to liquidate their crypto stake, relatives will sell it for them and use the hawala system, an honor-based system of credit common in Asia and the Middle East, to transfer the funds across the border to Afghanistan. The strategy requires a great deal of trust. In the case of Hotak, his friend in Pakistan doubles as his crypto broker. ""He is a very, very close friend. He has his details on the account that I use, so we could say that it's his account, but I use it,"" Hotak said of the arrangement.

Trust is also key when it comes to judging the quality of trading tips. ""There's a lot of scammers on YouTube and Twitter,"" warned Ramin. When he first started off, he would spend most of his money buying coins promoted by people looking for exit liquidity. ""That's why I stopped trading small-cap coins."" Hotak, on the other hand, has found a reliable online community that offers him sound trading advice. ""There's a few groups on Telegram, WhatsApp, and there's even a Pakistani community on Facebook I follow that gives me the signals to sell. I follow them, and it's been good so far,"" said Hotak. Brokers advertising crypto services on Facebook appear to be operating across the country. Hotak visited one in Herat in early 2020. He went to interview for a job there and says the two-story data center was packed with boys, mostly aged 20 to 25. ""They were all university people,"" he said. ""They all had smartphones in their hands, and they were just scrolling down and down."" CNBC has not spoken with any of these brokerages directly, but Hotak says the site he visited in Herat is still going. Hotak also says that Herat is home to a bitcoin mining farm. ""They had these very big CPUs. Very advanced,"" he said. But Hotak tells CNBC he didn't get to see the entire operation. ""I just got a little glimpse of it."" Blockchain analysts Lorne Lantz and Rieya Piscano say they looked at various data sources and found no sign of bitcoin or ethereum nodes running in Afghanistan, so it is unclear whether this miner in Herat has covered his online footprint, or whether he's cut off his rigs. Even with all of these workarounds, the political turmoil of the last few weeks doesn't make it easy to find time to think about crypto. ""The reality is I cannot focus on crypto trading when the ongoing events in Afghanistan are this intense,"" said Hotak. ""With no electricity and bad internet, crypto trading is near to impossible, so we just hold.""

Path to mass adoption

On Aug. 15, an hour and a half before Ramin's flight bound for Turkey was due to take off, then-President Ghani arrived to the airport in Kabul. After that, Ramin says that all flights were halted and everyone was kicked out. Ramin still has plans to leave, along with his family. But finding a flight is proving to be difficult. He's used his now dwindling supply of afghanis to purchase flights for ten members of his family. He's done this three times, and all three times, the flights were canceled. With travel agencies shut, he remains in a bit of a holding pattern on the ground in Kabul. Ramin is one among many looking to leave the country. Every media outlet on the planet has been circulating the same photos of Afghans clinging to planes, fleeing the country with whatever possessions they can carry. For several, this has meant having to leave a lot behind. Ramin estimates that around 5-10% of his net worth is in crypto, which makes it easier to plan an exit, knowing that there is some money in the bank to tide him over, especially since he doesn't know if he will ever see the money in his bank accounts in Kabul. ""If some type of government doesn't come to existence, then I could potentially see the majority of my wealth being wiped out,"" he said.

2021-08-23,NDTV.com,"Here's How You Can Invest In Bitcoin, Ethereum, Other Crypto Coins In India",https://www.ndtv.com/business/crytocurrency-in-india-heres-how-you-can-invest-in-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-other-coins-in-india-2515676,"In India, some popular exchanges are WazirX, CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Cryptocurrency has become a lucrative financial asset for investors these days with its scope to provide steady returns, despite its volatile nature. Being a form of a digital asset, cryptocurrency is primarily based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. The decentralized structure of the virtual currency allows it to exist without the control of governments or regulation of any central authority.

Ever since billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla Inc invested in the world's largest cryptocurrency- bitcoin, leading crypto coins such as ethereum, dogecoin, and bitcoin have caught the attention of the bigger investors as well as the common man.

In India, many are still advocating the classification of cryptocurrency as an asset. Recently, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the cabinet note on the cryptocurrency bill is ready and the Cabinet is yet to clear the same. Presently, cryptocurrencies are under no regulation in the country, which often makes it risky for investors.

However, one must know the basic steps of investing in cryptocurrency. Here is how you can invest in crypto coins such as bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin in India:

Step 1: Find the right crypto exchange

Since there is no established structure for trading in cryptocurrency yet, crypto exchanges are the platforms where people can buy and sell their digital assets. In India, some of the more popular exchanges are WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Step 2: Create an account

After selecting the crypto exchange for trading, create your account on the platform. After creating an account, select the amount you plan to invest, what you seek to invest. Read all policies of the platform carefully. The platform will ask for the submission of documents as proof in order to prevent any fraudulent activities.



Step 3: Set up the account for trading

One needs to have money in the account before buying cryptocurrencies. The money can be transferred from one's bank account to a particular exchange account. Upon transferring funds, make sure that both accounts are linked.

Step 4: Making the investment

After the accounts are linked and the crypto exchange account has money, one needs to select which coin they want to invest in. The world's biggest and most popular cryptocurrency is bitcoin, followed by ethereum by market cap. Other leading coins include tether, dogecoin, XRP, cardano, binance coin. After purchasing, make sure you store codes to the account, to protect it from risks such as hacking. Experts advise storing the coins purchased in a crypto wallet.

On Saturday, August 21, bitcoin was last trading 3.26 per cent higher at $48,707.8 against the US dollar. Ethereum - the world's second-largest cryptocurrency was last up 1.15 per cent higher at $3,273.60 against the American currency.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/ogfsfjs8_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,Inside Afghanistan's cryptocurrency underground as the country plunges into turmoil,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/21/bitcoin-afghanistan-cryptocurrency-taliban-capital-flight.html,"Crypto trader and vlogger Farhan Hotak traveling to the Shah Wali Kot District in Afghanistan.

Farhan Hotak isn't your typical 22 year-old Afghan. In the last week, he helped his family of ten flee the province of Zabul in southern Afghanistan and travel 97 miles to a city on the Pakistani border. But unlike others choosing to leave the country, once his relatives were in safe hands, Hotak then turned around and came back so that he could protect his family home – and vlog to his thousands of Instagram followers about the evolving situation on the ground in Afghanistan. He has also been keeping a very close eye on his crypto portfolio on Binance, as the local currency touches record lows and nationwide bank closures make it next to impossible to withdraw cash. ""In Afghanistan, we don't have platforms like PayPal, Venmo, or Zelle, so I have to depend on other things,"" said Hotak. Afghanistan still mostly operates as a cash economy, so money in Hotak's crypto wallet won't help him put dinner on his table tonight, but it does give him peace of mind that some of his wealth is safeguarded against economic instability at home. It also offers bigger promises down the road: Access to the global economy from inside Afghanistan, certain protections against spiraling inflation, and crucially, the opportunity to make a bet on himself and a future he didn't think was possible before learning about bitcoin. ""I have very, very, very limited resources to do anything. I'm interested in the crypto world, because I have earned a lot, and I see a lot of potential in myself that I can go further,"" he said.

Run on the banks

For many Afghans, this week has laid bare the worst-case scenario for a country running on legacy financial rails: A nationwide cash shortage, closed borders, a plunging currency, and rapidly rising prices of basic goods. Many banks were forced to shutter their doors after running out of cash this week. Photos featuring hundreds of Kabul residents crowding outside branches in a futile effort to draw money from their accounts went viral.

""There's no bank I can go to right now, no ATM,"" said Ali Latifi, a journalist born and based in Kabul. ""I live above two banks and three ATM machines, but they've been off since Thursday,"" said Latifi, referring to the Thursday before the palace ouster. Without an authority helming the Central Bank, it appears that printing cash to cover the shortfall isn't an option, at least in the short-term. The Western Union has suspended all services and even the centuries-old ""hawala"" system – which facilitates cross-border transactions via a sophisticated network of money exchangers and personal contacts – for now, remains closed.

Sangar Paykhar, a Kabul native currently living in the Netherlands, has been in constant touch with relatives there in recent weeks. He said that many who live paycheck to paycheck were, at first, borrowing money from others to get by, but now, those able to lend out cash have started conserving their funds. ""They've realized the regime has collapsed"" and that those they are lending to ""might not have a job tomorrow,"" said Paykhar. A few days before the Taliban entered Kabul, Musa Ramin was among the people who queued outside a bank in a fruitless attempt to withdraw cash. But unlike other Afghans in line with him that day, months earlier, he had invested a portion of his net worth into crypto. Ramin had been burned before by a rapidly depreciating currency, and decentralized digital money had proven to be a trusted safeguard. In 2020, on what was meant to be a brief layover on a trip from London to Kabul, Ramin got stuck in Turkey. A one-week, mandatory Covid quarantine ballooned into six months. ""I converted all my money to the lira,"" he said. After the Turkish currency began to spiral, Ramin said his capital was cut in half, and he was forced to conserve it. ""That is when I discovered bitcoin."" With all flights cancelled and no other options for departure, Ramin realized he needed to find alternative ways to support himself while stranded in Turkey during the pandemic-related shutdown. That's when he started trading crypto. ""At first, I lost a lot of money,"" he said. But he's since gotten the swing of managing his digital assets, thanks to Twitter and tutorials on YouTube.

Even after returning to Kabul, the 27 year-old says he put all his focus into trading crypto. 80% of his crypto capital is in spot exposure, primarily in major coins, like bitcoin, ethereum, and binance coin. The other 20% he uses to trade futures. ""I was making more money in crypto in a month than in construction in a year,"" said Ramin, though he did acknowledge the risk that's involved. ""It's easy making money in crypto but keeping that wealth is the difficult part."" Despite that volatility, Ramin still sees crypto as the safest place to park his cash. ""If a government isn't formed quickly, we might see a Venezuela-type situation here,"" Ramin told CNBC. He feels virtual tokens are his safest hedge against political uncertainty and plans to increase his exposure to digital currencies in the coming year to as much as 40% of his total net worth.

Ramin isn't alone in his thinking. Google trends data shows that web searches in Afghanistan for ""bitcoin"" and ""crypto"" rose sharply in July just before the coup in Kabul. That said, because this tool is a measure of interest, the spike could be referring to 10 searches or it could be 100,000. But in a country that has long relied on physical cash for virtually all transactions, not many people have the option to let their savings sit in a bank account, let alone a digital wallet. Just take Hotak. He lives in a remote part of Afghanistan where there are no ATMs or bank branches nearby. That means he has to keep a lot of physical cash on hand, in order to cover daily expenses. ""Afghanistan is an unexpected country, and you have to be ready for anything,"" he said. While Hotak thinks that crypto is his future, for now, the bulk of his income comes from day labor jobs, like shoveling, brick work, digging wells, and running a tailor shop that makes clothes.



""Zabul is not a very developed city. It's a village, so that's how I earn,"" he said.

Signs of a growing crypto economy

It's hard to get insight into crypto adoption in Afghanistan. Beyond the fact that measuring cryptocurrency adoption at the grassroots level isn't easy, people actively go out of their way to hide who they are. Some Afghans, for example, will conceal their IP address by using a virtual private network, or VPN, in order to mask their geographic digital footprint. And unlike many crypto boosters – who tend to be vocal and community-driven – digital currency supporters inside Afghanistan often don't want others to know they exist. ""The crypto community in Afghanistan is very small,"" said Hotak. ""They actually don't want to meet each other."" He thinks that could change if the political situation normalizes, but ""for now, everyone just wants to stay hidden until things are nice."" However, new research from blockchain data firm Chainalysis is offering fresh optics on the country's apparently burgeoning peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto network, which is increasingly the most telling metric of adoption in Afghanistan. Hotak, as well as his friends, use Binance's P2P exchange, which allows them to buy and sell their coins directly with other users on the platform.

Chainalysis' 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index gives Afghanistan a rank of 20 out of the 154 countries it evaluated in terms of overall crypto adoption. And when you isolate for its P2P exchange trade volume, Afghanistan jumps up to seventh place. That's a big move in just 12 months: Last year, Chainalysis considered Afghanistan's crypto presence to be so minimal as to entirely exclude it from its 2020 ranking. ""Afghanistan on top makes sense from a capital controls point of view, given it's hard to move money in and out,"" explained Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst. And some experts tell CNBC that Chainalysis could actually be underestimating its overall adoption. ""Unlike many other countries, sanctioned nations don't have good and clear data on P2P markets,"" explained Sobrado. He says that is partly to do with the fact that it is harder to track those transactions.

There are other anecdotal signs of adoption across the country. Nearly a decade ago, sisters and Afghan entrepreneurs Elaha and Roya – both of whom had a focus on computer science at Herat University – founded the Digital Citizen Fund, an NGO that helps women and girls in developing countries gain access to technology. The organization has 11 women-only IT centers in Herat and another two in Kabul, where they teach 16,000 females everything from essential computer skills to blockchain technology. Before classes were suspended earlier this week, creating a crypto wallet was also part of the curriculum. Elaha Mahboob tells CNBC that some students have chosen to secure their money in crypto accounts and a few have specifically started investing in bitcoin and ethereum in order to achieve their long-term financial goals. ""This is especially important as they don't have to worry about not having access to their money, because major banks in Afghanistan have closed,"" Mahboob said. A few Digital Citizen Fund participants have left the country and used the crypto accounts they made in class as a way to transfer their money out. Afghanistan's exposure to the cryptosphere was also taking place inside the presidential palace. Blockchain company Fantom told CNBC it had been working in tandem with the previous government. One such project with the Ministry of Health involved piloting blockchain technology to track counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Fantom says the pilot ""concluded successfully,"" and they had been preparing for national rollout before the Taliban took over. Then there's Sweden-based Bitrefill, an online marketplace that helps customers live on cryptocurrency by exchanging digital coins like bitcoin or dogecoin for gift cards with partner merchants. In Afghanistan, the card offerings include multiple mobile phone service providers, games such as Fortnite and Minecraft, Hotels.com, and Flightgift, which can be redeemed for flights with 300 international airlines. While the company wouldn't share sales numbers on the record with CNBC, Bitrefill does have the endorsement of Janey Gak, who uses it to top up her phone. Her Twitter account has become a must-follow for those who want to understand the situation on the ground through her eyes, but she's also evangelizing the power of bitcoin to transform the country. ""I'm just an ordinary person. I'm not anyone special,"" she said. ""I am just someone who discovered bitcoin a couple of years ago."" In 2018, Gak — who goes by the name ""Bibi Janey"" — started a Facebook page as a hobby to see what Afghans thought of bitcoin. ""I remember getting a lot of comments and questions like, 'Can you explain more?'"" she said. ""People would be fascinated by it, but they would be so confused."" She also got lots of questions about where to buy bitcoin. Since entering this world, she has learned how to code and reads as much as she can about bitcoin. ""I don't trade, I don't do any of that,"" she said. ""I just make some money here and there and save it in bitcoin."" Through her research, she's come to the conclusion that in order for Afghanistan to be a truly sovereign state, it must never borrow money – and adopt a bitcoin standard. To foment wider adoption, Gak commissions articles to be translated to local languages. ""It's not much, but it's a start,"" she told CNBC.

DIY crypto rails

The on-ramp to participating in the crypto economy in Afghanistan is complicated and there are still multiple barriers to entry. Access to the internet, while growing, remains low. There were 8.64 million internet users in Afghanistan in January 2021, according to DataReportal.com and internet penetration stood at 22%. Unreliable electricity poses another major issue, as power outages are common. ""Power goes out once every day for a couple of hours,"" said Ramin, though he noted that it happens in some parts of Kabul more often than others. When CNBC first spoke to Hotak, he was seated near one of the land-crossings into Pakistan, tapping into a WiFi network across the border. ""We don't have proper internet on the Afghanistan side,"" he explained. Hotak also uses solar power to charge his phone, given the country's long-standing issue with electricity outages. Electricity and a stable internet connection are two essential rails for widespread crypto adoption. Also critical is having access to some form of online banking or a credit card that is recognized internationally – which again, poses a big problem for many Afghans. Eighty-five percent of the country is unbanked, according to one U.N. estimate, meaning they do not have a bank account. So people wishing to deal in crypto have to get creative. Hotak and some of his contacts enlist the help of family and friends in neighboring Pakistan or across the Gulf of Oman in the United Arab Emirates, where they have easier access to global markets. ""It's very easy in Pakistan,"" he said. ""Most people have relatives in Dubai, who buy crypto for them using their credit cards."" When the person then wants to liquidate their crypto stake, relatives will sell it for them and use the hawala system, an honor-based system of credit common in Asia and the Middle East, to transfer the funds across the border to Afghanistan. The strategy requires a great deal of trust. In the case of Hotak, his friend in Pakistan doubles as his crypto broker. ""He is a very, very close friend. He has his details on the account that I use, so we could say that it's his account, but I use it,"" Hotak said of the arrangement.

Trust is also key when it comes to judging the quality of trading tips. ""There's a lot of scammers on YouTube and Twitter,"" warned Ramin. When he first started off, he would spend most of his money buying coins promoted by people looking for exit liquidity. ""That's why I stopped trading small-cap coins."" Hotak, on the other hand, has found a reliable online community that offers him sound trading advice. ""There's a few groups on Telegram, WhatsApp, and there's even a Pakistani community on Facebook I follow that gives me the signals to sell. I follow them, and it's been good so far,"" said Hotak. Brokers advertising crypto services on Facebook appear to be operating across the country. Hotak visited one in Herat in early 2020. He went to interview for a job there and says the two-story data center was packed with boys, mostly aged 20 to 25. ""They were all university people,"" he said. ""They all had smartphones in their hands, and they were just scrolling down and down."" CNBC has not spoken with any of these brokerages directly, but Hotak says the site he visited in Herat is still going. Hotak also says that Herat is home to a bitcoin mining farm. ""They had these very big CPUs. Very advanced,"" he said. But Hotak tells CNBC he didn't get to see the entire operation. ""I just got a little glimpse of it."" Blockchain analysts Lorne Lantz and Rieya Piscano say they looked at various data sources and found no sign of bitcoin or ethereum nodes running in Afghanistan, so it is unclear whether this miner in Herat has covered his online footprint, or whether he's cut off his rigs. Even with all of these workarounds, the political turmoil of the last few weeks doesn't make it easy to find time to think about crypto. ""The reality is I cannot focus on crypto trading when the ongoing events in Afghanistan are this intense,"" said Hotak. ""With no electricity and bad internet, crypto trading is near to impossible, so we just hold.""

Path to mass adoption

On Aug. 15, an hour and a half before Ramin's flight bound for Turkey was due to take off, then-President Ghani arrived to the airport in Kabul. After that, Ramin says that all flights were halted and everyone was kicked out. Ramin still has plans to leave, along with his family. But finding a flight is proving to be difficult. He's used his now dwindling supply of afghanis to purchase flights for ten members of his family. He's done this three times, and all three times, the flights were canceled. With travel agencies shut, he remains in a bit of a holding pattern on the ground in Kabul. Ramin is one among many looking to leave the country. Every media outlet on the planet has been circulating the same photos of Afghans clinging to planes, fleeing the country with whatever possessions they can carry. For several, this has meant having to leave a lot behind. Ramin estimates that around 5-10% of his net worth is in crypto, which makes it easier to plan an exit, knowing that there is some money in the bank to tide him over, especially since he doesn't know if he will ever see the money in his bank accounts in Kabul. ""If some type of government doesn't come to existence, then I could potentially see the majority of my wealth being wiped out,"" he said. For now, he and his family are just sitting tight, waiting to catch a flight out. But many people are staying put, in part because they want to foment positive change at home. ""In these circumstances, one can fully appreciate the censorship-resistance property of blockchain-based assets. I believe this is the main driver of the fundamental value of bitcoin and other cryptos,"" said Andrea Barbon, Assistant Professor of Finance at the University of St. Gallen. Gak, for example, thinks that using legacy financial rails like the hawala system might be one of the most effective ways to foster mass adoption. It is a vision she detailed in a prescient story she wrote for Hacker Noon in 2018. She's also thinking about opening her own exchange shop in Kabul.

2021-08-23,Analytics Insight,Cryptocurrency Bill: What Will Be India’s Stand on Digital Assets?,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/cryptocurrency-bill-what-will-be-indias-stand-on-digital-assets/,"Cryptocurrency Bill: What Will Be India’s Stand on Digital Assets?

After a long discussion by the Indian Government over cryptocurrencies in the country, finally a cryptocurrency bill is tabled before the Union Cabinet and everyone is waiting for approval. The bill attempts to regulate virtual currency in India. Presently cryptocurrencies in India are not under any regulation, this makes an unofficial area for Indian investors.

On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the cabinet note was ready on the cryptocurrency bill. She was awaiting Cabinet to clear that, she added.

Under the chairmanship of the Secretary (Economic Affairs), a high-level inter-ministerial panel was formed to explore the issues related to cryptocurrencies and propose specific actions that have already submitted its report. The report advocates that all private cryptocurrencies except the digital currencies that are issued by the state will be forbidden in India.

In the meantime, the RBI discusses the cryptocurrencies traded in the market and has conveyed the same to the government.

Back in May this year, the finance minister conveyed that a very calibrated position is supposed to be taken on crypto and virtual currency as the world is promptly transforming towards technology. Other media reports indicated that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be permitted as an asset class in India.

Highlighting the fact that both the government and the RBI are dedicated to financial strength and solidity, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said there are no differences between the central bank and the Finance Ministry on the matter, and that all should now await the final decision on the matter from the Centre.

Major concerns regarding cryptocurrencies have been identified by the RBI and that the government is in agreement with those concerns, said Mr. Das.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to control the production of its units and validate the transfer of funds, working independently of a central bank.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said, a three-judge bench, led by Justice R F Nariman, is responsible to be set apart on the ground of “proportionality”.

“Therefore, the writ appeals are enabled and the circular dated April 6, 2018, is set apart,” said the bench, which is also involving justices Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency-Bill-What-Will-Be-Indias-Stand-on-Digital-Assets.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,NDTV Gadgets 360,Cardano (ADA) Price Hits All-Time High Ahead of 'Alonzo' Upgrade,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cardano-ada-price-in-india-all-time-high-cryptocurrency-coin-alonzo-upgrade-founder-charles-hoskinson-2515498,"Cardano (ADA) price has jumped more than 50 percent over the last 10 days to occupy the third spot among the world's top cryptocurrencies with an $80 billion (Rs. 5,94,400 crores) market cap, ahead of the popular Binance Coin. During the wild ride, it touched its lifetime high of $2.58 (Rs. 191.70) but the gains had tapered off a bit by Saturday morning. The rally is being attributed to a coming “Alonzo” upgrade that will allow smart-contract functionality and a range of decentralised finance (DeFi) applications to run on the Cardano network. The proposed technological enhancement is likely to land as soon as next month.

Co-founded by Charles Hoskinson, a mathematician and former CEO of Ethereum, the Cardano network is being touted as a serious rival to the Ethereum blockchain, which currently dominates the DeFi services market. The ADA coin has jumped from $1.70 (Rs 126) on August 10 to $2.58 on August 20, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing this report, the Cardano (ADA) price in India was around Rs. 190.

The lack of smart-contract functions has been widely seen as Cardano's biggest drawback and their availability is Ethereum's biggest strength. These contracts are a way to ensure agreements can be validated securely.

Earlier this month, the development team behind the Alonzo upgrade announced the launch of the public test net, saying it was an “exciting and important next step” in the Cardano journey.

This is an exciting and important next step in the #Alonzo journey. In fact, the #Cardano journey. With the support of our OG community testers on the Blue & White phases, #AlonzoPurple will be the first fully public Cardano testnet to support #smartcontracts ????

2/12 — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) August 6, 2021

Despite the rally and even before it over the possibility of the coming upgrade, some people have shown skepticism about the success of the Cardano coin. This had prompted Hoskinson to respond to the naysayers in a tweet earlier this month, promising to start a fund to pay for the therapy of the critics.

It's extraordinary to me the level of skepticism about our upcoming smart contract launch. It's not something like SCs will be underwhelming, but rather it simply won't happen. The critics say it with biblical level certainty. We should start a fund to pay for their therapy — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 4, 2021

Meanwhile, the recent rallies in Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano (ADA), and others have helped the cryptocurrency market to surpass the $2 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,48,50,910 crores) market-cap milestone for the first time since May, when a market crash had routed the volatile trade.

2021-08-23,News18,Bitcoin Maximalists Think Cryptocurrency Could Have Stopped Afghanistan's Takeover. Here's How,https://www.news18.com/news/india/bitcoin-maximalists-think-cryptocurrency-could-have-stopped-afghanistans-takeover-by-taliban-heres-how-4110659.html,"Bitcoin maximalists have been opining that cryptocurrency will and could have been the fix for Afghanistan against Taliban. Some said that war financing could have stopped had crypto been the norm while others empathisized with Afghans worried about their savings as Taliban took over banks.

News18 explains what the maximalists had to say as part of their argument:

How could Bitcoin come to the rescue?

Dr. Josh Cotton, a Bitcoin advocate and founder of MilitaryToken, said in a tweet that “an enormous amount of cash just fell into the hands of the Taliban because cash can’t be truly secured,” adding of course, “Bitcoin fixes this.”

He was hinting towards the enormously secure blockchain technology used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that do not let access to any other individual.

A report by Vice quoted Jimmy Song, one of Bitcoin’s most ardent public advocates saying, “Bitcoin would have prevented the war in Afghanistan had it been the global reserve currency instead of the greenback. No sane government would have spent explicitly taxed dollars on a war that cost that much and lasted that long.”

“The only reason the US could was because of the dollar’s privileged position as the global reserve currency which allowed stealth taxation of the entire world through inflation.”

What is debasement and how are Bitcoiners assuring countries don’t finance war?

Debasement was practiced in the 16th century by England’s King Henry VIII to help fund wars with France and Scotland. The king replaced precious metal content of coins like gold with cheaper metals like copper, reducing the costs of currency production at the expense of taxpayers. Roman emperor Nero used to employ a similar trickery, cutting down on the silver content in the currency. By some estimates, debasement led to annual inflation of around 1,000 percent at one point in Roman history.

Some countries do something similar today, say the proponents of the debasement theory. The government prints more money than it can back up with underlying assets so that it can fund foreign wars, which comes at the expense of citizens in the form of taxes, according to public statements made by various supporters of the theory.

“Bitcoin doesn’t let governments do this crazy deficit spending as they are forced to get loans on the market to do so,” said Jimmy Song.

The idea of inflation as stealth taxation, and its connection with war financing, is one that’s commonly shared by Bitcoin maxis with a libertarian streak

What about Taliban taking over banks and people worrying about savings?

Afghans have been crowding banks trying to access their savings, but mostly in vain.

Not only would Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies make it difficult to confiscate wealth and to keep it safe but the whole situation could have been avoided had the world adopted decentralized money.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be stored on tiny USB thumb drive-sized hardware wallets or on online wallets. A user only needs to remember the corresponding passphrase or key to having access to funds.

2021-08-23,Analytics Insight,Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in This Weekend,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-cryptocurrencies-to-invest-in-this-weekend-august-edition/,"Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in This Weekend – August Edition

These cryptocurrencies are showing strong potential in the market.

Cryptocurrencies are growing to become stronger investment options as months go by. Keeping an eye on the crypto trends, a lot of new and seasoned investors are gearing up to make crypto investments. For that, Analytics Insight has made this of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this weekend.

1. Bitcoin

After the crypto market crash in the first half of 2021, experts were anticipating Bitcoin’s rise. After falling from grace, from US$60,000 to US$30,000, Bitcoin has finally crossed the US$45,000 mark. This marks Bitcoin’s potential to give good returns to investors who are looking to make long-term profits.

2. Ethereum

Next to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency. Its blockchain network transformed the DeFi sector and made way for decentralized apps. Recently, Ethereum launched its much-awaited new update that will improve the transaction fees and reduce Ether’s inflation. This change makes it easy for investors to understand the value of investing in Ether and give miners a fair fee.

3. XRP

XRP is purely a utility token created by Ripple. XRP’s blockchain platform aims to set up cross-border currencies without any hindrance. Since its launch, many banks have realized the capabilities of this token and the volume of transactions on this network has increased since then. One of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to buy, XRP has a bright future in the crypto market.

4. Tether

Tether is unlike most cryptocurrencies in the market as it is a stable coin. A stable coin is a digital token that has a fixed value and is pegged to a fiat currency, like the Euro or the Dollar. Similarly, Tether has a fixed value of US$1 or equivalent and maintains US$1 in reserve for each Tether issued.

5. USD Coin

USD Coin is a more popular stable coin as its value is strictly pegged to the US dollar. Stable coins withstand market volatility better and offer a more risk-free investment option.

6. Cardano

Cardano is known for its proof-of-stake network. Its open blockchain platform is open-source and decentralized. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its native token, Ada. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies to invest in.

7. Dogecoin

Dogecoin needs no introduction. It has made enough headlines, thanks to Elon Musk’s obsession with making cryptocurrencies trending. What once started as a joke has now become a legitimate investment option with its value that grew more than 50% since its inception. It’s also one of the cheapest cryptocurrencies to invest in.

8. Binance Coin

Binance Coin is a token native to the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. As long as there is activity on the Binance exchange, Binance coin will continue to steadily grow. Ranked among the top six cryptocurrencies in the world, Binance coin can be used to trade other cryptocurrencies as well.

9. Litecoin

Litecoin is a rival for Bitcoin’s blockchain network. Litecoin aims to pay for everyday goods and services with transactions faster than Bitcoin. Litecoin has been recognized for its practical purpose by market experts and trade merchants. This means Litecoin is a crypto that can suddenly take on a bull run.

10. NEO

Similar to Ethereum, NEO is a platform for smart contracts. Launched in 2014, NEO’s mission is to improve Ethereum’s network by offering the same utility functions via a more sophisticated blockchain. While NEOs network is superior to Ethereum, it will only reach its full potential in a couple of years. The wait will be worth it for investors.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Top-Cryptocurrencies-to-Invest-In-This-Weekend.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Yahoo Finance,Galaxy Digital floats blockchain fund as bet on cryptocurrency's booming DeFi movement,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/galaxy-digital-floats-blockchain-fund-as-bet-on-cryptocurrencys-booming-de-fi-movement-171702712.html,"As the nascent concept of decentralized finance (DeFi) gains traction in cryptocurrency trading — and draws more regulatory scrutiny — new players are creating products to meet rising demand.

Enter Galaxy Digital (GLXY.TO), which this week rolled out a DeFi Index Fund, their newest blockchain-based financial asset. The passive instrument tracks the performance of Bloomberg’s Galaxy DeFi Index, and is part of an estimated $80 billion industry that's poised for explosive growth in the coming years.

DeFi is not a new segment of the crypto space, but it has grown exponentially in the past year from $6.8 billion to $80 billion, according to data from DeFi Pulse.

Ben Samaroo, the CEO of a DeFi platform called WonderFi, explained to Yahoo Finance recently that the sector ""presents a faster, cheaper way to do finance."" He added that DeFi allows users to borrow money ""instantly"" without bank approval, or earn higher-than-average interest on assets.

Galaxy Digital's new fund is an attempt to offer clients a lower risk, and more regulatory-friendly way, to gain exposure to DeFi. The fund has been seeded by NZ Funds, a $2 billion institution that manages retirement savings accounts for New Zealanders.

NZ Funds is not a newcomer to investing in the crypto space. Previously, the retirement savings institution seeded Galaxy Digital’s Ethereum (ETH-USD) fund earlier this year. Before that, it took part in a $50 million private investment in Galaxy Digital Holdings’s public equity.

The Index is composed of 9 DeFi protocols in portions of 40 to 1 percent exposure. The protocols will be considered for addition and removal on a monthly basis.

While index funds aren’t intended to be actively managed, the removal or addition of DeFi protocols will rely on Bloomberg's principles for measuring an index such as data integrity, diversification, representation and continuity.

Growing scrutiny, and opportunities to profit

Story continues

Bloomberg's Galaxy DeFi Index compared with Bitcoin and Ethereum

DeFi is a family of crypto assets and underlying protocols which together form a complex financial system that relies most heavily on the Ethereum blockchain. Like much of the crypto world, DeFi's key selling point is stripping out the middle man in trading, which cuts costs and red tape.

Using self-executing (or ""smart"") digital contracts, developers can build applications on top of Ethereum and other blockchains. They are then used to devise new ways to borrow, lend and exchange assets in faster and cheaper ways than traditional finance.

While these projects cut out traditional intermediaries in the financial sector via peer-to-peer networks, not all DeFi protocols may be decentralized enough to skirt regulation. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said as much in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published this week, in which he suggested the agency would be taking a closer look at the sector.

Meanwhile, a widening range of big money players are now gawking at cryptocurrency and blockchain-based protocols, trying to understand whether crypto is supposed to fit in their portfolios. And for many traditional investors, taking the plunge requires some level of valuation.

Nick Juhle, director of research for wealth management firm Greenleaf Trust, faces this problem. With a total of $17 billion in assets under advisement, Greenleaf provides wealth management to approximately 1000 high-net worth individuals.

Since 2017, Juhle has received calls from clients every time Bitcoin's price surges, asking why the firm hasn't parked any cash in crypto. Yet Juhle still won't budge, because his team hasn't found a way to value it based on traditional valuation frameworks like cash flow and earnings results.

""The challenge with crypto, Bitcoin being the prime example, is that it doesn't really have intrinsic value. You can price it but you can't really value it. That's always the issue that we've run into,"" says Juhle. At this point, valuing the best DeFi protocols runs into the same issue for Juhle.

However, there is no unifying collective valuation framework for DeFi, according to Steve Kurz, Galaxy Digital’s Head of Asset Management. It's a clear barrier for more traditional retail and institutional investors with no crypto exposure, even if they are willing to accept the higher volatility synonymous with crypto.

Currently, the Galaxy Digital team uses “different strands” of metrics, such as the total value locked in protocols and other network usage statistics, to measure potential returns similar to how early stage venture capital performs valuation. Given time, the DeFi Index could provide one more strand for measurement.

“We are marching toward a collective valuation framework that's not quite ready for institutional primetime, but there’s enough to say as a venture [capital] bet, absolutely, DeFi can make sense in a portfolio,” Kurz told Yahoo Finance in an interview.

Juhle prefers the idea of an index fund that invests in the DeFi theme broadly, as opposed to ""betting on a specific protocol."" He also remains wary of the DeFi index's current correlation with the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum.

""Perhaps it will diverge over time as the market matures,"" Juhle suggested.

2021-08-23,The Motley Fool,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are All Soaring Today",https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/20/why-bitcoin-ethereum-and-dogecoin-are-all-soaring/,"What happened

Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) are up 6.82%, 8.16%, and 8.36% in the past 24 hours. As of 10:30 a.m. EDT, they are now trading at $48,518.76 per coin, $3,293.94 per token, and $0.3319 apiece, respectively.

Earlier in the day, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN), the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, announced it would be adding $500 million worth of cryptocurrency to its balance sheet. The move sent the whole sector into a monstrous rally. Coinbase stock is also up 3.10% to $255.98 per share in the same period.

So what

It's not just Coinbase's big move that investors are happy about. On Aug. 19, the second-largest mortgage lender in the U.S., UWM Holdings, announced it would start accepting Bitcoin for home loans. The adoption could take effect by the end of the third quarter, and the company is also considering adding other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum into the mix.

Speaking of Ethereum, it was revealed on the same day that the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract had become the largest holder of Ether -- at $21.3 billion. The news illustrates growing confidence in the Ethereum Foundation's transition to its 2.0 network. By the end of 2022, Ethereum will run a proof-of-stake protocol, which its development team estimates will cut its energy use by 99% -- essentially wiping out concerns about its environmental sustainability.

As for Dogecoin, the once-meme digital currency is growing in recognition. During popular discount brokerage Robinhood Markets' earnings release on Aug. 18, the company disclosed that Dogecoin accounted for 62% of cryptocurrency revenue in the second quarter. The same day, Ethereum's founder Vitalik Buterin announced he would be joining the development team behind Dogecoin as a board member.

Now what

Dogecoin is leaving behind its reputation as a joke cryptocurrency. Since the beginning of the year, the number of merchants accepting Doge as payment has grown by 34.7% to 1,616. In addition, the network has found its unique niche due to its slight inflationary nature. Dogecoin miners do not face the threat of their high-tech GPU mining rigs becoming redundant with the rise of PoS protocols. At the same time, the mining isn't so difficult as to induce heavy electricity use.

Bitcoin's slow, archaic, and environmentally unfriendly protocol is finally getting an overhaul, too. In a rare act of solidarity, miners worldwide reached the consensus for Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade, which will allow smart contract adoption on its network and is scheduled to take effect in November. Bitcoin has no central development team, so it's up to a unanimous vote from miners to upgrade the world's biggest cryptocurrency. The last one happened four years ago.

Overall, investors' fear, uncertainty, and doubt -- known in the cryptocurrency world as FUD -- regarding the sector in Q2 are melting away very quickly as new innovations are beginning to address these issues. It's looking like the start of the next bull run for the cryptocurrency sector.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640139/gettyimages-1171929176.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,The Economic Times,Future of Cryptos in India: A blanket ban or birth of a new age asset class?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/future-of-cryptos-in-india-a-blanket-ban-or-the-new-age-asset-class/articleshow/85489406.cms,"NEW DELHI: The cryptocurrency bill is before the Union Cabinet and it is likely to take a decision soon, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said.The proposed legisation on digital currencies was to be presented in Parliament during the monsoon session but that did not happen, said sources.The bill has reportedly recommended that all private cryptocurrencies, except virtual currencies issued by state, be prohibited in India. However, crypto experts say they are hoping for the best.Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of crypto trading platform Mudrex , says, ""We could expect an accommodative and progressive stance by the government towards cryptocurrencies. The government is expected to evaluate all possible aspects. All these events transpire to positive expectations from the cryptocurrency bill.""An inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency, under the secretary (economic affairs), had studies issues around virtual currencies and proposed specific actions in its report.Looking at the growing opportunities in this space, Siddharth Menon, COO of cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, says calibrated regulations that encourage the industry and safeguard consumers will help the ecosystem grow. ""We don't know the details but we expect it to be positive. Once we have more details, we will comment. Else it will be purely speculative,"" Menon adds.Some experts say India cannot be as a laggard when the world is rapidly moving ahead with blockchain technology. This has led to reports that crypto as an asset class might be allowed in India but the government will not accept it as legal tender as yet.Crypto enthusiasts are betting on analyst views that say there might not be a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies. Menon is among those who does not think a blanket ban is possible. The government has understood crypto assets are not a threat to national currency. ""Also, this is a new and growing global fintech industry. India cannot stay behind,"" he adds.Nobody is yet certain about the government's stance in the bill, says Patel, but adds: ""Legislation without a blanket ban would undoubtedly boost the crypto ecosystem in India.""Experts say there is a healthy startup ecosystem that has sprawled up around digital currencies. India has about 15 million people trading in cryptos , said a Bloomberg report in June.Sharan Nair, Chief Business Officer at crypto exchange platform CoinSwitch Kuber, says, investors should not panic. ""The government would ensure that investor interest is protected at all cost.""In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had advised all entities regulated by it to not deal in digital currencies. In 2020, the Supreme Court set aside the central bank’s 2018 circular and allowed banks and financial institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrencies. In May 2021, the RBI permitted banks to facilitate cryptos. ""There are no differences between the central bank and the finance ministry,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said.Negative news from the government will have impact just like it did in 2018, when most of the entrepreneurs either stopped working in this space or left the country, says Menon. ""After the RBI lifted the ban, we have seen a lot more interest among entrepreneurs and tech talent to enter this space. More crypto projects have been born since then,"" he adds.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85489438,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-271455,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,KSDK,"Bitcoin for everyone: Missouri mayor wants to give each resident $1,000 in cryptocurrency",https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/investigations/missouri-mayor-wants-to-give-residents-1000-bitcoin/63-a329a9ad-fb82-42a5-a835-8d08e47d428b,"Cool Valley Mayor Jayson Stewart is raising funds to give each resident up to $1000 in Bitcoin. The only catch? They can't sell it

COOL VALLEY, Mo. — A tiny Missouri town could become the first in the country to put Bitcoin in the hands of every resident.

Jayson Stewart, the Mayor of Cool Valley says he is raising funds to give each of the town’s roughly 1500 inhabitants a piece of the digital currency.

Many experts expect Bitcoin to grow in value exponentially in the next decade.

“My daughter says she thinks it's the next big thing. The digital currency,” said Ramona Nickels, a mail carrier who lives in Cool Valley.

“Look, it's digital gold,” said Mayor Stewart. “I would like to see every single household in my city receive some level of Bitcoin, whether it be $500 or $1,000.”

So what is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is one of many cryptocurrencies available today.

It is considered the most well-known cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has been around since 2008.

Think of Bitcoin like regular money. Except it's not issued by any country or impacted by traditional inflation.

You don't need a bank to use, store or transfer Bitcoin. It's completely online. Some economists believe if Bitcoin’s value keeps increasing at its current rate, it could one day become the world's currency.

Recently, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin it's legal tender. It was a move made to protect the country’s economy from rapidly rising inflation.

In Cool Valley, Stewart thinks holding the digital currency could be transformational.

“I have friends whose lives have been completely changed, like going from working a regular nine to five job to being worth over 80 million dollars in a matter of a few years,” said Stewart, who calls himself an Entrepreneur and Environmentalist.

Stewart said most of the money to fund the plan will come from several unnamed Bitcoin investors.

“I have some very supportive donors who have agreed to match any money that I raise up to several millions of dollars,” said Stewart. “I'm trying to get a few government funds as well to go along with that. Or potentially some of the relief money that comes in from the Covid relief.""

But Stewart isn’t ruling out using city funds, saying “It's possible. We'll see how it goes. We'll see how it goes.”

Save it, don’t sell it

Stewart says the Bitcoin will come with some strings attached. He doesn’t want residents to sell for a few years.

“We're putting in place like a vesting schedule for Bitcoin. The idea is that maybe you don't touch it for five years before you really get full access to it. We're working on ideas like that because that's my number one concern. Someone just sells their bitcoin to pay their car note. And then when Bitcoin is sitting at like $500,000 all these years later, they're going to really regret that,” said Stewart.



Roughly 1500 people live in Cool Valley. The dozen or so the I-Team spoke with seemed receptive to the plan.

“With cash people have bad habits and they buy things they shouldn't be buying. But with Bitcoin, maybe you can give it to your kids. My daughter is going to college next year. I could give [the Bitcoin] to her,” said Nickels.

“Putting money in my pocket! Sounds pretty good to me,” said Cornelius Webb, who lives in Cool Valley.

“I believe that Cool Valley is going to get wealthier and wealthier , not just our city, but the actual people who live here,” said Stewart.

Stewart said the city is also going to take proactive measures to off set the environmental impact Bitcoin mining is known to have.

“We're giving away Bitcoin and at the same time we're converting our entire city to solar, like all of the government lights and things like that,” said Stewart.

Details about how Bitcoin will be distributed are still unclear.

Stewart said it will involve door knocking and offering free classes to residents about how to use and securely store Bitcoin. He hopes to kick things off by the end of the year.","('https://media.ksdk.com/assets/KSDK/images/0bd7cda4-f1df-46f7-8b22-392dfe1e8477/0bd7cda4-f1df-46f7-8b22-392dfe1e8477_1140x641.jpg',)",none

Coinbase will buy $500 million in crypto on its balance sheet and allocate 10% of its quarterly profits into a crypto assets portfolio, company executives announced late Thursday.

The company plans to invest in ""Ethereum, Proof of Stake assets, DeFi tokens, and many other crypto assets supported for trading on our platform,"" becoming the first public company to do so, finance chief Alesia Haas said in a blog post.

CEO Brian Armstrong first revealed the brokerage's plans in an earlier tweet, saying he expects the allocation to grow as the market matures. He also indicated the company's ambitions to diversify its crypto services and operations, which mostly center around trading.

""Hopefully over time we can operate more of our business in crypto,"" Armstrong said on Twitter. ""Today it is still a mix.""

The price of bitcoin climbed higher on the news, passing $47,000 on Friday after sitting below $45,000 the previous two days. Coinbase shares rose more than 3% higher in early trading Friday.

The few companies that have included bitcoin in their holdings, like Microstrategy and Tesla (with the help of Coinbase), have done so as a hedge against inflation and potential devaluation of the U.S. dollar. On Thursday, Citi placed Microstrategy's rating under review, suspending its price target and estimates due to its investment in bitcoin and correlation to the digital currency's price.

The news comes a week after Palantir reported quarterly results showing it bought $50 million in physical gold to reportedly hedge against black swan events. Palantir also said it's accepting customer payments in bitcoin, but that none have used the option.

That same week, Coinbase reported quarterly earnings and growth metrics that wowed analysts, who are mostly patient about the stock's correlation to bitcoin's price and volatility and optimistic about its plans to drive long-term innovation throughout the financial system.

Haas said the investments will be driven by its custodial crypto balances and deployed ""over a multi-year window using a dollar cost averaging strategy."" She added that Coinbase is investing for the long term and ""will only divest under select circumstances, such as an asset delisting from our platform.""

Oppenheimer's Owen Lau said he doesn't expect the new investment policy to lower the correlation between Coinbase and bitcoin ""materially in the near future."" However, he said he sees it as a signal that Coinbase can ""further facilitate and influence both retail and institutional adoption"" over time by integrating cryptocurrencies into its own operations, like paying vendors and employees, for example.

The news follows a Wall Street Journal report this week that Coinbase has stockpiled $4 billion in cash to weather regulatory headwinds. Lau noted the company still has plenty of cash on hand despite the transaction.

""Share repurchases and dividends appear to be off the table at least near term, but we believe management will use excess capital to reinvest in the business and make acquisitions, especially in international presence and subscription-based business,"" he added.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106868176-1618411319630-106868176-16184112292021-04-14t143834z_1561353557_rc2qvm91n6cr_rtrmadp_0_coinbase-ipo.jpg?v=1618411334',)",none

It is now the third most valuable cryptocurrency .

. The rally in the crypto asset's value is being attributed to an update that will extend the smart contracting mechanism to the blockchain.

It’s often called “ethereum killer” because of its potential of taking on the mightier crypto with an improved smart contracting system.

The new update will open Cardano to the world of DeFi, NFT, and other automated transaction systems.

Cardano has hit a new all-time high, rising over 20% in the last 24 hours, with its price peaking at $2.55. The cryptocurrency that is powering Charles Hoskinson’s public blockchain has regained the spot of being the third-largest crypto with a whopping $80 billion market cap.The Cardano blockchain's cryptocurrency is called ADA, and the system is often touted to be a direct Ethereum and Solana competitor. It has surpassedCoin and is now the third most valuable crypto after Bitcoin and Ethereum.The rally in the crypto asset's value is attributed to the Alonzo Purple public test net launch. It's the final test phase of the project, which will end in the network finally getting smart contracts capability.The entire crypto market has witnessed a bullish rally in the previous week, pushing its market cap to more than $2 trillion. While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to lead the race, new altcoins are constantly challenging the norm. The price dips from the last two months have not seemed to affect the digital asset's price too much, as it's now back well over $2. It reached an all-time high previously in May, remaining just a little shy of $2.5.The upcoming ‘Alonzo’ upgrade is driving the bullish sentiment. The development team announced the launch of the public test net on Twitter. Incorporating smart contracts is critical for the blockchain as it introduces a range of new capabilities such as DeFi (decentralised finance), NFT (non-fungible token), automated lending, and more.The new update is likely to land on September 12, and investors are confident that it'll be a game-changer. Often called the ""ethereum killer,"" it's four times the size of Solana in terms of market cap but has little practical use-case right now.On the flip side, Japanese authorities have permitted it to float on exchanges in the country. While crypto regulations worldwide are at a nascent stage, Japan's decision is also cited as an indirect mark of due diligence and compliance.Smart or blockchain contracts are unique in the way that they ensure compliance between the two parties. Immutability is one of the most remarkable features of a self-executing contract. It means it is impossible to reverse, alter, or tamper the codes, rules, and even the transactions once programmed on the blockchain.Like traditional contracts, smart contracts are agreements between two or more parties, avoiding the need for vigilance or enforcement from third parties.It's self-executing and impossible to reverse, alter, or tamper with the code, internal regulations, and transactions. The blockchain network maintains a transparent, secure, and immutable transaction ledger that ensures proof of ownership is also established and transferable. Contract negotiation and application become far more accessible, and all the edit history of the transaction is also transparently available.Furthermore, it can also be deployed for DAOs (decentralised autonomous organisations), which require communities to be bound to specific rules coded into blockchain contracts combined with governance mechanisms.Ethereum is infamous for its smart contracting ability and was created by Vitalik Buterin and four other co-founders in 2013. Polkadot, EOS, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and many others still compete for the throne, but none of them can defeat the industry's first mover.

Asian countries are outpacing the rest of the globe in terms of cryptocurrency adoption. According to a recent analysis from market research firm Finder, the top five nations in terms of bitcoin ownership are all located in Asia. Most of them were considered unimportant in the cryptocurrency industry; however, a recent study contradicts the same.The Asian country with the highest percentage of cryptocurrency ownership was Vietnam, at 40 per cent, followed by Indonesia, India , Malaysia, and the Philippines, respectively. 30 per cent of individuals polled in Indonesia and India stated that they held cryptocurrency.According to media reports, India also ranked #2 in a poll of nations that use cryptocurrency the most, with 9% of the respondents claiming they used crypto. Meanwhile, the United States and the United Kingdom had the lowest proportion of cryptocurrency owners, with 8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.After the Supreme court ruled out the RBI ban on crypto transactions, there has been a massive increase in retail investors. CoinSwitch Kuber , the largest cryptocurrency platform in India, has onboarded nearly 8 Million users since June 2020.One trend that has been consistent around the globe is that younger people are leading the charge when it comes to cryptocurrency adoption. Young people between the ages of 18 and 34 make for more than 40% of users throughout the world, according to Finders One of the main reasons behind this is the growth of crypto-based companies such as CoinSwitch Kuber, making crypto investing easy and accessible to individuals.The user base also consisted primarily of those aged 35 to 44, with 17 per cent belonging to those in their 45 to 54-year-old. Also, in nations such as Colombia and Netherlands, crypto adoption is seen majorly among the elderly ie, those above the age of 65.Smaller towns in India have been at the forefront of cryptocurrency acceptance in recent years. The increase in user subscriptions from Tier II and Tier III locations on the CoinSwitch Kuber app have grown by over 2000%.Studies show that the adoption of the crypto market has grown by over 880% between June 2020 - June 2021 worldwide and the number of crypto users in India has crossed over 15 million during this time.Recently, there has been a flurry of activity in India’s cryptocurrency space, with the government working towards acting on laws and investors pouring money into crypto companies. Recently, CoinSwitch Kuber raised $25 million in their Series B round from a VC giant named Tiger Global at a $500 million valuation.According to a poll conducted by global consultancy company PwC, India can be among the leaders in the adoption of the overlying blockchain technology that crypto is based on, over the next five years, if an appropriate degree of business and government engagement is achieved.Sharan Nair, the CBO of CoinSwitch Kuber , stated that “The cryptocurrency industry is steaming hot. 2021 has seen an accelerated interest in the crypto space as companies look to gain exposure to the market. Several sectors floundered in FY21, given the challenges of doing business in a pandemic environment. Fintech, for the most part, was not one of them.”Around 15 million Indians are believed to have made investments in private cryptocurrency holdings. Cryptocurrency investments in the nation increased from $923 million in April 2020 to almost $6.6 billion by May 2021, a growth of about 400% in only one year.Following the announcement of a carefully calibrated position on cryptocurrency and digital money earlier in May, the Finance Ministry stated that the world is evolving quickly with technological advances. The possibility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming recognised as an asset class in India has also been floated recently.On the other hand, the central government has stated that Bitcoin or crypto would not be accepted as legal tender shortly.But there is some good news for the crypto community: the government has stated that it would “investigate the application of crypto’s blockchain technology actively to usher in the digital economy.” Instead of outright outlawing cryptocurrencies, the Indian government may impose stringent rules and regulations in their place.For now, the response to crypto in India has been overwhelmingly positive. It is clear that cryptocurrency does have a market in the country, and it is growing exponentially.The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.

How did it all begin?

NEW DELHI: The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) - the central bank of China - has heeded the advisory sent by its Shenzhen branch to show zero tolerance to cryptocurrencies.Following the advisory, PBOC has taken ‘cleansing’ operations of 11 companies that used to deal with cryptocurrencies in the Shenzhen region, according to a report in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that quoted the state-run Shanghai Securities News.However, the authorities have not divulged finer details of how the issue was dealt with.Shenzhen is a global resource centre for computer hardware that includes cryptocurrency mining equipment.In recent times, this region developed into one of the key bases for China’s digital token investment community, the report adds.As a global economy, China had sensed danger from crypto to its economy and money market following traders going overboard with their passion for the digital currency.The authorities had apprehensions that if allowed to grow, cryptocurrency would be a threat to the financial stability of the country. They had targeted Bitcoin and other digital tokens.In February 2021, Shenzhen shut down eight companies for their alleged activities in digital tokens. The Shenzhen branch of PBOC had cracked down on cross-border trading in foreign currencies and stocks which included cryptocurrencies.The Chinese do not distinguish between foreign currency and cryptocurrency. Both are equal in terms of the damage they cause to their economy. But the Chinese financial experts were okay with foreign exchange earned by trading legal currencies.Shenzhen’s move against cryptocurrency shows the mood of the Chinese administration. It became more evident in the last few months after the State Council’s Financial Stability and Development Committee, chaired by Vice-Premier Liu He, announced a further crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading.Two major operators in China – Huobi, and OKCoin cancelled the business license registration of their respective subsidiaries in Beijing.BTCChina, which once ran the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange is quoted in the report saying that it had “completely exited from bitcoin-related businesses” on the mainland.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85484786,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,NDTV.com,Hackers Steal $97 Million From Japan Crypto Exchange In 2nd Major Heist,https://www.ndtv.com/business/hackers-steal-97-million-from-japanese-cryptocurrency-exchange-liquid-2514915,"Liquid said it had suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals while it assesses the impact of the attac

Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid was scrambling Friday to recover stolen assets worth nearly $100 million, in the second such major heist by hackers in recent days. The Tokyo-based company said in a statement Thursday that it had ""detected unauthorized access of some of the crypto wallets managed at Liquid"".

Elliptic, a London-based firm which helps track stolen cryptocurrencies, said its analysis found ""just over $97 million in cryptoassets have been received by the accounts identified by Liquid as belonging to the thief"".

""Our investigators are also aiding Liquid with tracking the stolen funds,"" Elliptic added in a blog post.

The heist comes after a hacker stole assets worth $600 million last week from cryptocurrency trading company Poly Network, before gradually giving the money back, claiming they had pulled off the theft to highlight a security flaw.

Liquid said it had suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals while it assesses the impact of the attack, although trading was continuing.

Cryptocurrencies have soared in popularity as assets in recent years, despite their volatility and concerns over their environmental impact as trading them requires vast quantities of electricity.

Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies use a technology called blockchain, which ensures that every transaction is recorded.

Thieves trying to steal cryptocurrencies typically move the funds through many different accounts at dizzying speed -- sometimes hundreds of thousands of transactions -- in an attempt to cover their tracks.

However, industry players have grown better at identifying and blocking stolen coins. Liquid said $16.3 million worth of stolen Ethereum had already been frozen ""due to the assistance of the crypto community and other exchanges"".","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/2r1h0gng_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none

Here's What To Know

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images

For many people, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are part of an exciting and lucrative new financial frontier. But for the country's top market watchdog, Gary Gensler, they seem ""like the Wild West"" – and he's promising a crackdown.

The market for cryptocurrencies has ballooned. It is currently estimated to be worth about $2 trillion, thanks to the exploding popularity of Bitcoin and other virtual money like Dogecoin.

Amateur investors, particularly younger ones, have started buying and trading cryptocurrencies, attracted to the thrill of big returns. In the past year, the value of Bitcoin has risen 300%. And cryptocurrencies are increasingly also attractive to traditional investors.

But the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, and even as it becomes more mainstream, it continues to be popular among bad actors.

In recent months, hackers have demanded ransomware payments in Bitcoin, because it is easy to transfer and hard to trace. And there have been plenty of reports of thefts and heists at cryptocurrency exchanges in which cybercriminals have absconded with other people's virtual holdings.

In a recent speech, Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), denounced the lack of transparency and clear regulations, and promised the commission will take action to protect investors, which is a key part of the agency's mission.

""Investors really aren't getting the information to judge the risk, and understand the risk,"" Gensler said. ""If we don't address the issues, I worry a lot of people will get hurt.""

The process is still at the very beginning, but here's what to know.

So, who's Gensler?

Gensler is an experienced regulator, who has worked on Capitol Hill and in the Treasury Department. When he ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration, he played a key role writing and implementing new rules that apply to a segment of the market called derivatives.

Gensler also knows a lot about cryptocurrencies. Most recently, he was a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he focused ""on blockchain technology, digital currencies, financial technology, and public policy."" (One of his courses is available for free online.)

How are cryptocurrencies regulated right now?

The market has developed so fast, regulations haven't kept up. So policymakers have talked about reining in cryptocurrencies under a new regulatory framework for years. But so far, that hasn't happened.

That leaves millions of people who trade cryptocurrencies and assets related to them without clearly defined rules of trading.

It has also complicated life for professional investors and companies that do business with cryptocurrencies. Tiffany J. Smith, a partner at the law firm WilmerHale, who runs a cryptocurrency regulatory practice, helps her clients mitigate risk.

""In the absence of, you know, definitive regulation that applies to crypto assets, we work with them to craft policies, procedures, and processes,"" she says.

So what to expect first?

Clearer definitions is one of the most pressing issues.

Because cryptocurrencies are relatively new, there are not even universally agreed-upon definitions for some of the most basic terms. Can assets being traded on cryptocurrency exchanges be called securities, or are they something completely different? Is Bitcoin a commodity?

This goes beyond semantics; It can determine which regulator has the authority to regulate cryptocurrencies and related assets.

New York University Law School Professor Robert J. Jackson Jr., who used to be an SEC commissioner, says clarity is incredibly important.

""It's past time for regulators to be clear about who is responsible for this, and that clarity will be beneficial to the market,"" he says. ""It will be beneficial to investors. It will even be beneficial to those members of Congress and the other public policymakers who want to know whom to ask, and who to hold accountable for what is going on in those markets.""

What else can we also expect earlier on?

Determining jurisdiction will be critical as well.

So far, the SEC and the CFTC have shared regulatory responsibilities. They have tried to police cryptocurrencies with laws that are already on the books, even though they were really written for other traditional kinds of assets like stocks or bonds.

Smith expects this is likely to continue until there are new, cryptocurrency-specific regulations, meaning regulators will continue to adapt current frameworks for the virtual currency market.

""We are going to see both the SEC and the CFTC using their current authorities to regulate the market as best they can,"" says Smith.

But Gensler has called on Congress to give regulators the authority to write new rules.

He also wants more resources — more money and manpower — to regulate cryptocurrencies. For years, leaders of the SEC and the CFTC have complained that Congress hasn't given them enough money for them to their jobs.

Are there any specific actions expected?

There will be new proposed regulations for sure; It's just not clear in what form.

Gensler has not tipped his hand, and he did not spell out specific actions the SEC might be contemplating during his speech.

But in his speech, Gensler called for the need of ""guardrails,"" or actions intended to protect individual investors, for cryptocurrencies.

So the SEC is likely to take a closer look at aspects like the potential for market manipulation, determining basic rights for amateur investors and bringing in more transparency.

Congress is also proposing new rules. The Senate tucked in a provision to toughen tax enforcement on cryptocurrency players in its recent infrastructure bill, though the final fate remains uncertain given that the House has yet to weigh in.

How does the industry approach regulation?

So far, professional investors say they would actually welcome new regulations – as long as they are not too stringent.

Robert Jackson, the former S.E.C. commissioner, argues regulation will widen the appeal of cryptocurrency assets.

""The market will be better off, because assuring investors that they are getting the kind of transparent pricing they are used to in American markets will encourage other investors to consider the possibility of investing in cryptocurrency,"" he says.

But rules perceived as too stringent will inevitably spark fights. Lobbyists for the cryptocurrency industry tried to fight off Senate rules, calling the tax crackdown too broad.

How will new regulations change cryptocurrencies?

This is a fascinating existential question. Cryptocurrencies were borne of this iconoclastic desire for there to be assets untethered from governments and central banks. No one is really sure what will happen to it when that structure changes.

But many believe new regulations could help cryptocurrencies become a bigger part of our daily lives. For example, some companies, including AMC Theaters, have already announced they will accept cryptocurrencies as payment.","('https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/08/19/gettyimages-1234060979_wide-80455078d37f22a33cb4bc0ced8be44539c83d7b.jpg?s=1400',)",none

2021-08-23,Forbes,"Cardano’s Ada Surges To New High, Becoming Biggest Cryptocurrency To Hit Record Price After $1 Trillion Crash",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/08/20/cardanos-ada-surges-to-new-high-becoming-biggest-cryptocurrency-to-hit-record-price-after-1-trillion-crash/,"Topline

While the broader cryptocurrency market took a breather, Cardano's ada extended a stunning weeks-long rally early Friday morning, soaring 10% in a matter of hours as trading volume in the token, which last week became the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, swelled amid anticipation for a coming software upgrade that could help it compete with Ethereum.

Now the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, Cardano's ada has skyrocketed 1,300% this year. getty

Key Facts

Cardano's ada jumped more than 14% to a price of $2.49 by 12:52 a.m. EDT Friday, its highest point since a record of $2.46 on May 16, according to crypto data website CoinMarketCap, and taking its market capitalization above $75 billion. Reflecting investors' Thursday fervor, as of 11:00 p.m. EDT, more than $8 billion worth of ada tokens had traded hands in 24 hours—the highest one-day showing since a May price surge. The token has been on a steady tear this month, soaring 85% as Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson teased a September network upgrade, named Alonzo, that will enable the Cardano blockchain to process smart contracts, self-executing agreements between buyers and sellers that have helped Ethereum dominate the booming $100 billion decentralized finance industry. Prospects of a software upgrade have also boosted Ethereum to three-month highs in recent weeks, but Cardano's newer network, which still trails in adoption, has drawn skeptics like former billionaire hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz. In a tweet after ada became the world's third-largest cryptocurrency this month, Novogratz, a staunch bitcoin bull, said the token's rise was ""a mystery"" to him and suggested its platform was struggling to gain traction among software developers who build the programs necessary for a cryptocurrency's adoption. Hoskinson, who also cofounded Ethereum, hit back at the financier, responding to a tweet touting that Cardano requires less energy than Ethereum to process transactions and mocking Novogratz's background in the traditional banking space.

Key Background

Cardano's ada skyrocketed in May after billionaire Elon Musk soured on bitcoin and said Tesla would no longer accept the cryptocurrency due to the hefty environmental downside of the massive amounts of electricity used to “mine” new coins. The crypto market crashed and has yet to fully recover, but ada surged to new highs as investors flocked to more environmentally sustainable tokens. Hoskinson has claimed Cardano uses just 6 gigawatt hours of energy annually—not even 0.01% of the 115.85 terawatt hours bitcoin is estimated to use. The token plunged nearly 60% as the broader market collapsed this summer but has since started to outperform bitcoin and ether.

Surprising Fact

Ada has skyrocketed 1,300% this year alone, making it the best-performing top five cryptocurrency compared to returns of 1,030% for binance coin, 330% for ether and 59% for bitcoin. However, the token is also highly susceptible to the broader crypto market’s massive volatility. Ada crashed nearly 90% within less than two months in early 2018 as regulatory crypto crackdowns ushered in a years-long bear market for the nascent industry.

Tangent

Amid Cardano's late-night rally, the broader cryptocurrency market climbed less than 4% and floated around a total value of $2 trillion. The market soared above $2.5 trillion in May but plummeted amid concerns over regulations banning cryptocurrency mining in China.

""I think we're still in kind of the early-to-mid stage of its long-term trajectory,"" Alden, who founded Lyn Alden Investment Strategy in 2016, told Insider in an interview. ""So that remains, I think, the best risk-reward as kind of a set-it-and-forget-it allocation.""

Alden believes bitcoin had a good chance of topping $100,000 at some point before the end of 2022 while a supply squeeze caused by a recent ethereum upgrade is ""tactically bullish"" and could send the ethereum price soaring to over $5,000.

The combined cryptocurrency market has recently returned to over $2 trillion, fueling many bullish bitcoin and ethereum predictions.

Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone has also said bitcoin could soon hit $100,000 while Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, thinks bitcoin is due a surge higher and will rally strongly through the second half of 2021.

The latest crypto rally has seen two rivals to ethereum's blockchain, cardano and solana, more than double in the last month alone.

The bitcoin price has added almost 300% over the last year though other smaller cryptocurrencies, ... [+] including ethereum, cardano, and solana, have made even bigger gains. Coinbase

""I think solana is a well-designed ethereum competitor,"" Alden said. ""Its main risk is that it's newer. It doesn't really have a significant network effect yet. And so it hasn't really reached a critical mass, but it is well-designed.""

Solana has close links with the rapidly growing FTX crypto exchange—FTX's sister company Alameda Research is an investor in solana, and FTX also operates its own decentralized exchange called Serum on the solana blockchain.

Cardano, now the third-biggest cryptocurrency by value after bitcoin and ethereum with a total value of $75 billion, has surged 30% during the last week as investors eye a much-anticipated upgrade that's due to be released on September 12. The completed upgrade will enable the cardano blockchain to support smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

""The upgrade will help cardano to match ethereum's capabilities,"" Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at Vienna-based brokerage Bitpanda, wrote in an emailed note.

Alden is less confident when it comes to cardano, however.

The Michigan-based mortgage company confirmed to CNBC that it's aiming to start by accepting bitcoin, though UWM is in the process of evaluating ether and other cryptocurrencies as well.

""We are evaluating the feasibility and requirements in order to accept cryptocurrency to satisfy mortgage payments,"" said Ishbia in a tweet via the company's account.

UWM – the nation's second-biggest mortgage lender after Quicken, the Detroit-based lending giant owned by Rocket Companies – works solely through wholesale channels, meaning that the company employs a fleet of brokers who then connect clients to home loans.

The push into decentralized digital money comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of crypto from all sides in the U.S.

Revamped crypto tax rules are a part of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, and financial authorities like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and Fed Chief Jerome Powell have all spoken recently on the topic of whether to regulate cryptocurrency.

It is unclear is whether UWM will hold the cryptocurrency it accepts or convert it to fiat at the point of transaction. The company did not immediately get back to CNBC with that information.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106758801-1603459526384-picture-perfect-beautiful-house-on-the-island-of-coronado-in-sunny-california-beautifully-landscaped_t20_6lJOrv.jpg?v=1603459593',)",none
2021-08-23,Yahoo Finance,"Ethereum Will Continue To Beat Bitcoin In 2021, Says deVere Group CEO",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-continue-beat-bitcoin-2021-155121406.html,"What Happened: The founder and chief executive officer of one of the world’s largest independent financial advisory organizations believes that Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) will outperform Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) for the rest of the year.

deVere Group CEO Nigel Green told City AM on Wednesday that Ethereum’s recent run of good form and operability improvements has not gone unnoticed.

“Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin and it can be expected to continue this trend for the rest of 2021,” he said.

Green highlighted that Ethereum is up by more than 240%, outperforming all other benchmark assets, while Bitcoin is up less than 38% year to date.

In his view, there are two key factors driving Ethereum’s impressive performance.

“First, Ether has a higher level of real-use potential as Ethereum – the platform on which it is the native cryptocurrency – is the most in-demand development platform for smart contracts, thereby highlighting that network’s value not only as a platform for developers but as a worldwide financial utility,” he said.

“Second, investor enthusiasm for the game-changing transition to ETH 2.0, which makes the Ethereum network considerably more scalable, sustainable and secure.”

According to him, these upgrades represent a major boost, not just for Ethereum but for blockchain technology itself.

The deVere executive went on to state that his bullish bias towards Ethereum did not hinder his confidence in Bitcoin, and he continued to have optimistic price targets for the leading digital asset.

“I remain confident that Bitcoin will hit, or even surpass, its mid-April all-time high of $65,000 by the end of 2021,” he said.

However, Green maintained that Ethereum’s technical advantages over Bitcoin will mean that its value will exceed it, “probably within five years.”

“There will be peaks and troughs along the way of course, but Ethereum’s ascent to the top of the cryptoverse seems unstoppable,” he said.

Price Action: At press time, Ethereum was trading at $3,065, slightly up over the past 24-hours.

Bitcoin was also up by 0.11% during the same period and was trading at a price of $45,721 at the time of writing.

2021 has been a big year for cryptocurrency. But what’s next?

We’ve seen Bitcoin hit a new all-time high price, regulatory talks with potential to have big impact on the industry, and more institutional buy-in from major companies. All the while, people’s interest in crypto has skyrocketed this year: it’s a hot topic not only among investors but in popular culture too, thanks to everyone from long-standing investors like Elon Musk to that kid from your high school on Facebook.

In many ways, the first half of 2021 has been a “breakthrough,” says Dave Abner, head of global development at Gemini, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. “There’s tremendous focus and attention being paid to [the crypto industry].”

RELATED: Top Crypto News This Week

But the industry is only in its infancy and constantly evolving. It’s difficult to predict where things are headed long-term, but in the coming months, experts are following themes from regulation to institutional adoption of crypto payments to try and get a better sense of the market.

While exact predictions are impossible, we asked five experts about what they’re paying attention to in the crypto space for the rest of 2021:

Cryptocurrency Regulation

Expect continued conversations about cryptocurrency regulation. Lawmakers in Washington D.C. and across the world are trying to figure out how to establish laws and guidelines to make cryptocurrency safer for investors and less appealing to cybercriminals.

China reaffirmed its efforts to crack down on digital currencies this year, primarily through crypto mining regulations, while U.S. Senators have considered new regulation to bolster cryptocurrency tax reporting measures.

“Regulation is probably one of the biggest overhangs in the crypto industry globally,” says Jeffrey Wang, head of the Americas at Amber Group, a Canada-based crypto finance firm. “We would very much welcome clear regulation.”

Like most things with cryptocurrency, regulation comes with hurdles. “There are different agencies that may or may not have jurisdiction to oversee everything,” says Wang. “And it differs state by state.”

Both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have expressed their agencies’ interests in regulation, while Security and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has commented on both his own agency’s and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s role in policing the industry. Plus, the IRS has an obvious interest in making sure investors know how to report virtual currency when they file their taxes.

Clear regulation would mean the removal of a “significant roadblock for cryptocurrency,” says Wang, since U.S. firms and investors are operating without clear guidelines at the moment.

What new regulation could mean for investors

Recent proposed legislation could make it easier for the IRS to find cases of tax evasion when it comes to crypto, though investors should already keep records of any capital gains or losses on their crypto assets. But the new rules may also make it easier for investors to properly report crypto transactions.

“This is because if the bill passes, exchanges will have to issue 1099-B tax forms with cost basis information to investors,” Shehan Chandrasekera, CPA, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker.io, a crypto tax software company, recently told NextAdvisor. “This will significantly reduce the crypto tax filing burden.”

Regulatory announcements can also affect the price of cryptocurrency in already volatile markets. Market volatility is why investing experts recommend keeping any cryptocurrency investments to less than 5% of your total portfolio and never invest anything you’re not OK with losing.

Ultimately, many experts believe regulation is a good thing for the industry. “Sensible regulation is a win for everyone,” says Ben Weiss, CEO and cofounder of CoinFlip, a cryptocurrency buying platform and crypto ATM network. “It gives people more confidence in crypto, but I think it’s something we have to take our time on and we have to get it right.”

Possible Crypto ETF Approval

SEC Chairman Gensler recently hinted that investors may soon have access to a cryptocurrency ETF, which would represent a new and more conventional way to invest in crypto. A cryptocurrency ETF would allow investors to buy cryptocurrency directly from traditional investment brokerages they may already have accounts with, like Fidelity or Vanguard.

“We do it in the equity market, we do it in the bond markets, people might want it here,” Gensler said at the Aspen Security Forum earlier this month, while also acknowledging there have already been filings for crypto ETFs with his agency.

ETF approval has been in consideration by the SEC multiple times over the past few years, but none have yet been greenlighted as in other regions, like Canada and the EU.

“I was anticipating that approval would happen before the end of 2021. I’m still hopeful for that,” says Abner. “There’s obviously a lot of people looking at it with the other regulation that is being introduced. That could potentially slow things down, but I think there’s still a possibility you could see some approval, either at the end of this year, or at least early in 2022.”

What a crypto ETF would mean for investors

Crypto ETFs are not yet available in the U.S., but approval could mean more Americans buying in and influencing the crypto market. Instead of learning to navigate a cryptocurrency exchange to trade your digital assets, you could add crypto to your portfolio directly from the same brokerage with which you already have a retirement or other traditional investment account.

However, investing in a crypto ETF would still carry the same risk as any crypto investment — it’s a portfolio of assets, but would be diversified only by different cryptocurrencies, which are all speculative and volatile. If you’re not willing to lose the money you put into crypto by purchasing on an exchange or an eventual crypto fund, you should carefully consider if you’re willing to take on the risk of having cryptocurrency in your portfolio at all.

Broader Institutional Cryptocurrency Adoption

Mainstream companies across industries have taken interest — and in some cases themselves invested in — cryptocurrency and blockchain in 2021. AMC, for example, recently announced it will be able to accept Bitcoin payments by the end of this year. Fintech companies like PayPal and Square are also betting on crypto by allowing users to buy on their platforms. Tesla continues to go back and forth on its acceptance of Bitcoin payments, though the company holds billions in crypto assets. Experts predict more and more of this buy-in.

“We’ve seen a tremendous amount of inflow of attention, and that’s going to continue to drive the growth of the industry for a while now,” says Abner.

Some experts predict bigger, global corporations could jumpstart this adoption even more in the latter half of this year. “What we’re looking at is institutions getting involved in crypto, whether it’s Amazon or the big banks,” says Weiss. A huge retailer like Amazon could “create a chain reaction of others accepting it,” and would “add a lot of credibility.”

Indeed, Amazon has recently sparked rumors that it’s making moves to that end by sharing a job posting for a “digital currency and blockchain product lead.” Walmart is also recruiting a crypto expert to oversee its blockchain strategy.

What more institutional adoption means for investors

While paying for things in cryptocurrencies doesn’t make sense for most people right now, more retailers accepting payments might change that landscape in the future. It’ll likely be much longer before it’ll be a smart financial decision to spend Bitcoin on goods or services, but further institutional adoption could bring about more use-cases for everyday users, and in turn, have an impact on crypto prices. Nothing is guaranteed, but if you buy cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value, the more “real world” uses it has, the more likely demand and value will increase.

Bitcoin’s Future Outlook

Bitcoin is a good indicator of the crypto market in general, because it’s the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the rest of the market tends to follow its trends.

Bitcoin’s price has taken a wild ride so far in 2021, from a high point of $60,000 in April to less than $30,000 as recently as July. More recently, Bitcoin has climbed back toward $50,000. This volatility is a big part of why experts recommend keeping your crypto investments to less than 5% of your portfolio to begin with.

But how high will Bitcoin go? Bitcoin’s past may provide some clues, according to Kiana Danial, author of “Cryptocurrency Investing for Dummies.”

Danial says there have been plenty of huge spikes followed by pullbacks in Bitcoin’s price since 2011. “What I expect from Bitcoin is volatility short-term and growth long-term.”

Others are more bullish on Bitcoin’s short-term growth.

Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at TokenMetrics, a cryptocurrency analytics platform, thinks the price of Bitcoin will climb throughout the rest of the year. “I think it’s more likely Bitcoin goes to $75,000 than $25,000,” he says.

What Bitcoin price volatility means for investors

Bitcoin’s volatility is more reason for investors to play a steady long game. If you’re buying for long-term growth potential, then don’t worry about short-term swings. The best thing you can do is not look at your cryptocurrency investment, or “set it and forget it.” As experts continue to tell us each time there’s a price swing — whether up or down — emotional reaction can cause investors to act rashly and make decisions that result in losses on their investment.

The Future of Cryptocurrency

We can speculate on what value cryptocurrency may have for investors in the coming months and years (and many will), but the reality is it’s still a new and speculative investment, without much history on which to base predictions. No matter what a given expert thinks or says, no one really knows. That’s why it’s important to only invest what you’re prepared to lose, and stick to more conventional investments for long-term wealth building.

“If you were to wake one morning to find that crypto has been banned by the developed nations and it became worthless, would you be OK?” Frederick Stanield, a CFP with Lifewater Wealth Management in Atlanta, Georgia, told NextAdvisor recently.

Keep your investments small, and never put crypto investments above any other financial goals like saving for retirement and paying off high interest debt.","('https://time.com/nextadvisor/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/na-the-future-of-crypto-1000x630.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,More than $90 million in cryptocurrency stolen after a top Japanese exchange is hacked,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/liquid-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack.html,"Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid said Thursday it has been hit by a cyberattack that saw hackers make off with a reported $97 million worth of digital coins.

Liquid said some of its digital currency wallets had been ""compromised,"" and that hackers were transferring the assets to four different wallets.

""We are currently investigating and will provide regular updates,"" Liquid tweeted. ""In the meantime deposits and withdrawals will be suspended.""

Liquid did not provide an estimate for the loss. It says it is regulated by Japan's Financial Services Agency. The watchdog was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

Elliptic, a blockchain analytics company, said its analysis showed that about $97 million in cryptocurrencies have been obtained by the hackers.

Of the total haul, $45 million in tokens were being converted to ethereum through decentralized exchanges — blockchain-based platforms that require no intermediaries — like Uniswap and SushiSwap, Elliptic said.

""This enables the hacker to avoid having these assets frozen — as is possible with many Ethereum tokens,"" Elliptic said in a blog post.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106930253-1629367715182-gettyimages-1234739851-porzycki-internet210817_npTeY.jpeg?v=1629368128',)",none

DeVere Group CEO Nigel Green also believes that Ether’s value will have exceeded Bitcoin’s within a few short years.

“Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, and it can be expected to continue this trend for the rest of 2021,” he said.

Ether has gained more than 300% so far this year, whereas the world’s most popular digital asset is up 55% by comparison. “In fact, it has outperformed all other benchmark assets in the first half of this year,” added Green, according to City AM.

The respected analyst attributed two key factors to Ether’s stellar performance in 2021.

The company executive isn’t bearish on Bitcoin (BTC), however, and remains confident that Bitcoin will have hit, or even have surpassed, its mid-April all-time high of $65,000 by the end of 2021. However, Green concluded that:

“Ethereum’s ascent to the top of the cryptoverse seems unstoppable.”

In early June, deVere launched a fixed-yield bond that tracks futures of Bitcoin and Ether on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

According to United Kingdom crypto exchange CoinJar, Ether has flipped Bitcoin in almost every metric that matters. In a blog post on Wednesday, the exchange stated that Ether is already surpassing Bitcoin in a number of areas, including the number of transactions, total value transacted, daily active wallets, transaction fees and mining revenue.

According to Coinbase’s second-quarter report, Ether’s trading volume has flipped Bitcoin’s for the first time in its nine-year history.

Trading in ETH made up 26% of total volumes in the second quarter, up from 21% in the previous three months, and higher than Bitcoin’s 24% for the period.","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDgvYzZkNzgwZTYtODBmYi00NmJkLThhNzktYjhmMjhhZDJjOWEwLmpwZw==.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,Cryptocurrency traders seek damages from Binance after a major outage cost them millions,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/cryptocurrency-traders-seek-damages-from-binance-after-major-outage.html,"In this article BTC.CM=

ETH.CM=

When Canadian cryptocurrency trader Fawaz Ahmed saw the price of ethereum dropping, he knew it was time to get out. Unfortunately for him, he couldn't. Ahmed was trading on Binance, the world's largest digital currency exchange by trading volume. And on May 19, Binance experienced a major outage which meant that, for about an hour, he was unable to exit his position. That day, bitcoin and ethereum posted their biggest one-day drops since March 2020, with the entire crypto market losing roughly $1 trillion in value. When prices fell below a certain point, Ahmed's position got wiped out. His personal losses came to about $6 million. ""This loss was not fair,"" Ahmed, a 33-year-old who trades full-time, told CNBC. ""This is something which was out of my control."" Binance's customer service team gave Ahmed an ""absurdly"" low offer of compensation, he said. Ahmed is one of hundreds of investors expected to take part in arbitration proceedings against Binance, seeking damages for the money they lost when the cryptocurrency exchange went offline. Binance said it was unable to comment on ""pending legal matters."" ""Our policy is fair in that we compensate users who experienced actual trading losses due to our system's issues,"" a spokesperson for the firm told CNBC. ""We do not cover hypothetical 'what could have been' situations such as unrealized profits.""

Binance has experienced several outages over the years in times of heightened volatility for virtual currencies. That can be costly for traders, especially when prices are plunging. And those losses can balloon to millions of dollars when investors make risky bets using leverage, or borrowed money, to augment trades — which, on Binance, is something users do often. Binance recently cut the maximum leverage customers can take on futures — financial derivatives that oblige investors to buy an asset at an agreed-upon price at a later date — to 20 times from a previous limit of 125 times. Binance wasn't the only crypto exchange to face disruption to its service on May 19. Coinbase users were also temporarily unable to access its site. Bitcoin plunged as much as 30% to nearly $30,000 that day. It has since recovered to $45,790.

No headquarters

Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, Binance's boss, has previously said the exchange has no official headquarters. That makes it extremely difficult for investors to figure out how, and where, to take the company to court. A group of crypto traders hopes to change that. With the help of Liti Capital, a little-known Swiss private equity firm providing litigation financing, nearly 1,000 people are expected to join arbitration proceedings in Hong Kong to seek damages from Binance. ""This is a landmark case for the industry,"" David Kay, chief investment officer of Liti Capital, told CNBC.

Binance is ""the first company that has ever grown to any size in any industry — much less the financial industry — where there is no regulation,"" he said. ""They have no home, they have no headquarters, they have no office."" ""The only place where Binance has said they have jurisdiction is in a Hong Kong international arbitration court,"" Kay added. ""This will be the largest consumer international arbitration in history."" Kay said that Liti Capital began working on the Binance case after receiving a call from Aija Lejniece, an independent lawyer working with a group of crypto traders in France. Lejniece specializes in international arbitration cases. Binance's terms of use say that any legal dispute must be resolved through arbitration at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre. Arbitration proceedings, unlike class action lawsuits, aim to settle disputes out of court. The format makes it harder for the average consumer to make a claim, Kay said, as claimants have to pay arbitration fees and additional costs — for instance, traveling to Hong Kong. Individually, that could set each claimant back an estimated $65,000. To cover those costs, Liti Capital has promised to provide a minimum of $5 million in funding.

White & Case, a New York-based law firm, has been hired to represent the claimants. Abby Cohen Smutny and Darryl Lew, two White & Case partners based in Washington, D.C., and Hong Kong-based partner Melody Chan, will serve as their lawyers.

Though cryptocurrencies don’t have any official global or governmental backing like your other financial instruments, the popularity they have seen in recent years has been quite robust. Most of this popularity stems from famous billionaire tycoons like Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey actively voicing their opinions on digital currency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum being an asset.

This has brought crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum to the forefront of the public domain and has the average citizen interested in investing in it. It should be noted that recently, the crypto market has taken a beating and prices for some of the most popular coins saw an all-time low. However, experts believe that due to rising demand and interest, the market will recover and even move upwards.

With so much going for cryptocurrency and especially in India where so many are advocating for its classification as an asset, you should know exactly how to invest. Here are the basic steps you need to carry out to successfully invest in cryptocurrency.

Step 1: Finding the Right Crypto Exchange

Cryptocurrencies are not regulated in India, hence there is no established structure or uniformity to trading in cryptocurrency yet. This is where crypto exchanges come in. They act as a platform through which you can buy and sell your digital assets. Some of the more popular exchanges in India include WazirX, CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Step 2: Create your Account

After finalising the exchange that best suits your needs, create an account similar to that in a bank. Depending on the policies you opt for, the amount you plan to invest and what you plan to invest in, the exchange will ask you to verify. They will ask you to submit documentary proofs to prevent cases of fraud.

Step 3: Setting up the Account for Action

Before you can buy any cryptocurrencies, you will need money in your account. The money can be put in via a wire transfer from your normal bank account to the exchange account. Make sure to link both. Also, depending on the policy you may have to face a waiting period before purchases can take place.

Step 4: Buying Cryptocurrency, Making the Investment

Once you have everything set up, you need to pick which coin or coins you may want to invest in. The most popular one by far is Bitcoin, followed by other altcoins such as Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin, Tether, XRP and Dogecoin to name a few. After you make your purchase comes the most important part – storage. Crypto exchanges don’t have any formal institution backing them and they most certainly do not carry your average insurance policy. They also face the risk of being hacked. Therefore, it is important you store your codes to your account and your assets securely. It is often more advisable to store your bought coins in a crypto wallet.

Bitcoin Price Today

Bitcoin price slipped 0.94 per cent in last 24 hours to $44,799.18 on Thursday. Over the last seven days, the coin dropped 0.58 per cent. Other coins such as Ether and Cardano have been trading in red and green respectively. Ether price dropped 1.21 per cent in the last 24 hours to settle at $3,011.60 on Thursday. Meanwhile, Cardano was up by 5.24 per cent at $2.13.

Speaking on the upward trend of Bitcoin, ZebPay Trade Desk said, “Bitcoin has made an impressive comeback over the past week or so, up almost 45 per cent from its recent lows. The market sentiment towards the asset has turned, and gone are the days where people would say that the asset might test $20,000 levels.”

NEW DELHI: Ever since cryptocurrencies arrived on the world investment scene in 2009, their journey has been astonishing.Although there has been a rush of investors jumping on to the crypto bandwagon in the past few years, their volume has not reached anywhere near that of stocks, precious metals, forex and commodities.Online platforms such as Bloomberg and Investopedia have estimated that there are around 1.5 crore crypto investors in India already.More than 350 start-ups have been working in the blockchain and crypto space in India. They estimate that crypto investment from Indians have shot up from $923 million in April 2020 to around $6.6 billion in the last fiscal.But many investors continue to sit on the fence, unable to fully grasp the viability of cryptocurrencies as an investment. To ease them into the system, here we have dope on 7 top cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be born and remains the most powerful until today: very high in value and the most preferred one by investors globally.However, it is also highly volatile and sometimes its price oscillates widely. Some of those who have invested in Bitcoin in the past decade are now millionaires.In Indian Rupee, the cost of one Bitcoin has never come down below Rs 35 lakhs and during the fiscal year 2020-21 it even hit Rs 56 lakh.The volatility had not worried investors as those who invest in whole Bitcoins got their value back plus the premium.Investors buying in fractions need to follow the graphs closely to get a bang for their buck and not lose money. There are hardcore Bitcoin investors who have invested sums as low as Rs 100 and improved their earnings 20-30 times in value. Bitcoin is also a favourite of day traders.Bitcoins are also perceived as precious as they were meant to be finite - there can be no more than 21 million bitcoins created.Believe it or not, this came out of a dog meme that went viral on the internet. Dogecoin was created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Unlike Bitcoin, which is designed to be scarce, the Dogecoin is intentionally abundant — 10,000 new coins are mined every minute and there is no ceiling on the maximum supply.Due to their abundance, small investors are picking them up in sizable volumes. Though its base price is lower than most of the other digital coins, the sheer volume it generates on the exchanges is astounding.Investors are currently wondering if the Dogecoin will ever reach $1 in price. When it does, it will be bonanza time.Ethereum works on a decentralized software platform. It has inbuilt smart contracts and a decentralized applications system.It can be built and operated without any time lag. You can steer clear of dubious transactions and gain full control as an investor in terms of value, transaction and transfer.One extraordinary feature of Ethereum is that it is bereft of any interference or control from any non-specific operators. Ethereum was launched in 2015. Currently it has 19 percent of market capitalisation of the dominant counterpart Bitcoin.Litecoin came into being in 2011. It was one of the first cryptocurrencies following the birth of Bitcoin.It is touted as the silver alter ego of the Golden Bitcoin. But looking at the excitement it has created among the new generation of investors, it may strike gold soon.Litecoin works on a faster block generation rate, which enables the investor to get faster transaction confirmation. So far in 2021, the Litecoin capitalised $10.1 billion and boasts of a value of $153.88 on a per token basis. It is the sixth-largest cryptocurrency in the world.Its founder Charles Hoskinson was one of the five co-founders of Ethereum and it is created in the same genre.Being unhappy with the direction of Ethereum, Hoskinson parted ways and founded Cardano on the environmentally sustainable, Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol with the help of mathematicians, engineers, and cryptographists.Cardano has established a market capitalization of $9.8 billion and each coin trades at $ 0.39.With high interoperability within the blockchains of the same genre, Polkadot perches comfortably among the cryptocurrencies of its size.Polkadot is embedded with systems that enable its developers to create their blockchains.At the same time it is said to be uncompromising on security and safety.

2021-08-23,Moneycontrol,India ranks second in global cryptocurrency adoption index,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/india-ranks-second-in-global-cryptocurrency-adoption-index-7359841.html,"Most of the top 20 countries are developing countries like Tanzania, Togo and Kenya.

India ranks second in the global cryptocurrency adoption index only behind Vietnam, according to the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

The worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency has grown by over 2,300 percent since the third quarter of 2019 and over 881 percent in the last year.

“Our research suggests that reasons for this increased adoption differ around the world — in emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions, while adoption in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia over the last year has been powered largely by institutional investment,” the report said.

The ranking was based on three metrics including peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trading volume and value received. India was followed by Pakistan and Ukraine at rank three and four respectively. The US and China’s ranking dipped from sixth to eighth and from fourth to thirteenth respectively.

The report attributes this drop in ranking to falling P2P volumes in the two countries compared to worldwide volumes.

Most of the top 20 countries are developing countries like Tanzania, Togo and Kenya. “Many emerging markets face significant currency devaluation, driving residents to buy cryptocurrency on P2P platforms in order to preserve their savings. Others in these areas use cryptocurrency to carry out international transactions, either for individual remittances or for commercial use cases, such as purchasing goods to import and sell,” the report said.

“Many emerging markets represented here limit the amount of the national currency that residents can move out of the country. Cryptocurrency gives those residents a way to circumvent those limits so that they can meet their financial needs,” it added.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/07/Cryptocurrency-1-770x433.jpg',)",none

Get your hands-on big income by following these ways to earn cryptocurrency without spending money

‘How to earn money online?’ is a very common question that everybody is interested in. Since the emergence of the internet and online sources, many people are engaging in online activities to get their hands on good income. But winning cryptocurrency through online mode is not the most preferred choice. Well! It should be. Backed by blockchain technology and powered by decentralized mode, cryptocurrency is one of the fastest-growing digital assets. Many people are jumping into the digital currency sphere by investing in it. Although there are multiple ways in which investors can earn cryptocurrency, most of them are less familiar among enthusiasts. Besides, everybody’s favorite cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, also provides many ways to win them without spending anything from your pocket. While some offer bitcoin or fiat currencies in exchange for your time and effort, some others provide crypto-coin which gives you a choice to buy the digital currency of your interest. Unfortunately, finding the right ways to earn cryptocurrency is tough. Therefore, Analytics Insight has listed the top ways to earn cryptocurrency without spending money.

Top Ways to Win Cryptocurrency

Give a Try on Crypto Mining

If you are tech-savvy, then crypto mining is one of the easiest ways you can earn cryptocurrency. However, the process and routines are not the same for all digital currencies. It varies based on the crypto you want to mine. Besides, cryptocurrency mining is also a complicated process. Many think that mining cryptocurrency means you can pick up all the digital currencies you have mined and keep them as yours. But unfortunately, that is not the case in the practical mining process. Miners use their computers to solve complex mathematical equations that validate blocks of transactions. Cryptocurrencies are already created inside a protocol that gets on to the market when it is cracked with valid keys. As a result, the person who engages in the mining process gets a reward. Interested candidates usually join mining networks and engage in mining work with other members.

Engage in DeFi Yield Farming

Similar to crypto mining, decentralized finance projects also need somebody to work for them. But unline mining, is a process of locking the funds in the network. Yield Farming, also known as Liquidity Mining, is a method of locking funds and grant liquidity to a DeFi token. As a result of locking up cryptocurrencies, you will gain a reward. Mostly, the reward comes in form of a digital token. Compound, Kyber Network, and 0x are some of the famous DeFi sources.

Just Shop and get ‘Bitcoin Back’

In a move to promote their platform and fulfill cryptocurrency enthusiasts’ needs, many online sellers are leveraging disruptive ways to attract consumers. One such idea is ‘Bitcoin Back.’ Some online sellers are already engaging in this kind of cryptocurrency back for every purchase customers make on their platform. The recent company to join the game is Lolli, a Google Chrome or Firefox browser extension. Similar to Rakuten and Honey, it offers discounts and cash backs when using the portal to shop online. After making payment, Lolli gives a bitcoin back ranging from 1% to as much as 30%.

Get Cryptos through Airdrop

Although earning cryptocurrency through Airdrop is not a risky task, the providers are at a hectic spot between life and death. Yes, when developers want to gain traction for their new digital currency, they send it as a complement to routine crypto investors to garner adoption. Many crypto trading platforms often engage in Airdrops to publicize new cryptocurrencies. They pick out crypto investors who have a certain amount of existing investment. If you qualify, the platform or developer will send Airdrops directly to your wallet.

Earn Cryptocurrency Dividents

Earning cryptocurrency dividends is one of the easiest ways to earn more cryptocurrency. You just need to buy some cryptos and hold them for a while. In exchange, developers pay you for holding their digital assets. Besides, you don’t even have to stake them in your wallet, just holding them for a while will do the work. The mechanism behind this is that a digital currency’s value goes up based on the number of buyers it gets. Therefore, developers try to attract more buyers by showing that they have a good amount of investors already. COSS, CEFF, KUCOIN, and NEO are some of the famous dividend providers.

Get Employed at Cryptocurrency Companies

There is a never-dying need for workers in the cryptocurrency sphere. Cryptocurrency companies are always looking for candidates who can fill digital marketing, content creation, and web designing profiles. Some even offer work at employees’ convenience like remote mode, flexible working hours, and part-times. Besides, the companies also offer competitive packages. Therefore, if you happen to come across one, don’t hesitate and take up the opportunity.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Top-Ways-to-Earn-Cryptocurrency-Without-Spending-Money.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,NDTV.com,Cryptocurrency Bill: Find Out India's Stand On Digital Assets,https://www.ndtv.com/business/cryptocurrency-bill-know-india-s-stand-on-the-digital-assets-2513450,"The RBI is also reportedly considering ways to bring out a central bank digital currency

The Indian government has been sitting on the fence for a long time over cryptocurrencies in the country. A much-awaited cryptocurrency bill in this regard has been tabled before the Union Cabinet and awaits its approval. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that the cabinet note was ready on cryptocurrency (bill), and that she was awaiting Cabinet to clear that. Earlier, an inter-ministerial panel, headed by the Secretary (Economic Affairs), had submitted its report on cryptocurrency. Currently, cryptocurrencies are under no regulation in India, which makes it a grey area for Indian investors.

Cryptocurrency and legislation

The central government had formed the inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency in order to examine the issues related to digital currencies. According to reports, the panel recommended all private cryptocurrencies be prohibited in India. However, virtual currencies issued by the state may be allowed. During the Monsoon Session in the Parliament, the cryptocurrency bill was expected to be tabled but it did not happen.

According to the bulletin for the Budget Session prepared by the Lok Sabha Secretariat, the bill “seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India”. But it allows a few exceptions in order to promote the technology behind cryptocurrencies and their uses.

The Reserve Bank of India and cryptocurrency

In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) brought out an advisory notice to ""all the entities regulated by it not to deal in"" cryptocurrency. However, in 2020, the Supreme Court lifted the central bank's ban and allowed banks and financial institutions to provide services even if they were related to digital currencies.

In May 2021, the Deputy Governor of RBI said that they were considering ways to bring out a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The cryptocurrency bill could facilitate its coming.

Indian cryptocurrency investments

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that are growing popular among Indian investors. These currencies basically disrupt the central bank model of transaction and trading. Indians have invested over $6 million in cryptocurrencies. Almost 1.5 crore Indians are estimated to have made these investments. Several hundred startups have also started operating in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-02/kq34jumk_cryptocurrency-bitcoin-reuters_625x300_11_February_21.jpg',)",none

They have found USB sticks containing large quantities of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world after Bitcoin. The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the scheme cheated people from the UK, US, Europe, China, Australia, and Hong Kong. The victims deposited money, some even their entire life's savings, believing it to be a genuine saving and trading service using Binance Smart Chain. Two people were arrested for alleged fraud and money laundering, but they have been released under investigation.

The discovery has brought into focus the anonymous and international nature of these virtual currencies. Criminals often take advantage of anonymity to launder money and for terrorism, tax fraud, and drug trafficking. Although a majority of cryptocurrency transactions are legitimate, many are also fraudulent.

GMP's Economic Crime Unit said a total of $9.5 million (roughly Rs. 70.6 crores) in stolen Ethereum was discovered in the seized USB sticks. The police found another $12.7 million (roughly Rs. 94.4 crores) a few days later after finding an online safe (a cryptograph safety deposit box) and its access code.

The GMP said they have begun locating the rightful owners, some of whom are still unknown and spread across the world, and reuniting them with their money.

One of the victims of the fraud, who wished to remain anonymous, told the police that he had been using cryptocurrency for years. “The hack really surprised us at first,” he added, thanking the police for tracking the money.

GMP said the victim will now get 90 percent of his investment back and if all the funds remain unclaimed, he will receive the full amount.

Detective Chief Inspector Joe Harrop of the Economic Crime Unit said people are increasingly moving online and see cryptocurrency as the future of money and trading. But this shift is also leading to a new type of crime and opportunist criminals are looking to exploit these trends as well as any gaps in the technology. Harrop said policing also needs to adapt to this emerging type of crime.

Using factors like peer-to-peer exchange trading volume and value received, Chainalysis said global cryptocurrency adoption rose some 881 percent in the past 12 months.

The firm sees institutional markets as crucial but aimed to highlight the countries with the greatest cryptocuurrency adoption by retail investors. It focused on use cases related to transactions and individual saving, rather than trading and speculation. Top-ranked countries are Vietnam, India, Pakistan, and Ukraine.

“In emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions,” Chainalysis said in the report. It added that “adoption in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia over the last year has been powered largely by institutional investment.”

Interest in cryptocurrencies has surged since the onset of the pandemic, in part because of substantial gains by digital tokens like Bitcoin and Ether. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index has climbed about 380 percent in the past year. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 34.71 lakhs while Ethereum price in India stood at Rs. 2.34 lakhs as of 10am IST on August 19.

The Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index ranked 154 countries by three main metrics. China and the US both dropped in the rankings, primarily because peer-to-peer trading volume declined. Last year, China ranked fourth and the US sixth. This year, the US is eighth and China 13th.

Chainalysis took out one factor it had used previously: number of deposits by country weighted by number of Internet users. The firm found that it skewed the rankings toward countries with comparatively more decentralised finance, or DeFi, users. Instead, it's creating a DeFi Adoption Index that it said will be available in coming weeks.

“Growing transaction volume for centralized services and the explosive growth of DeFi are driving cryptocurrency usage in the developed world and in countries that already had substantial adoption, while P2P platforms are driving new adoption in emerging markets,' Chainalysis said, adding a key question is whether new approaches will disrupt those trends.

2021-08-23,Times Now,Cryptocurrency investment: All you need to know about transaction charges,https://www.timesnownews.com/cryptonow/article/cryptocurrency-investment-all-you-need-to-know-about-transaction-charges/800208,"Representational image

Key Highlights Many retail investors are now opening accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges to trade/invest in this asset class. Like stocks, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined by demand, supply and market dynamics. Similar to stocks, cryptocurrency transaction on an exchange involves certain transaction costs.

New Delhi: Gradually cryptocurrencies are finding a place in the portfolios of retail investors as they believe this asset class will soon emerge as the most lucrative asset class of the 21st century. Many retail investors are now opening accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges to trade/invest in this asset class. Like stocks, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined by demand, supply and market dynamics. Similar to stocks, cryptocurrency transaction on an exchange involves certain transaction costs. New investors should be aware of the costs involved in cryptocurrency trading. Here are the different transaction costs levied by crypto exchanges.

Exchange/trading fees: Exchange fee or trading fee is the amount charged by the cryptocurrency exchange for executing a buy or sell transaction. Typically, in India, crypto exchanges charge transaction fee as a fixed percentage of trade value. For example, WazirX, which is a cryptocurrency exchange, follows a flat fee structure of 0.2% for everyone. ""People can also pay trading fee using WRX on WazirX to avail 50% discount on fees, thereby making it the lowest trading fee in India at just 0.1%,"" said Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX.

Some crypto exchanges also follow a variable fee model depending on the volume of trading. If you are an active trader or you have transacted a high value over a longer rolling period, you may negotiate a lower trading fee with the exchange. So, investors are advised to do their own research before registering with a particular exchange so that they can get the best brokerage as per their trading volume.

It may be noted that exchange fee is the primary source of revenue for crypto exchanges and forms an integral part of their business model.

Network fees: Other than exchange fees or trading fees, crypto investors will also have to pay network fee, which is payable to the cryptocurrency miners for the work they do. Crypto miners are individuals who work with powerful computers to verify and validate transactions to be added to a blockchain. Miners play an integral role in crypto transactions by ensuring that tokens weren’t spent twice and transactions are real and true.

Worth mentioning here is that cryptocurrency exchanges have no direct control over the network fees and it is payable to the miners/validator of the network. When the network becomes crowded on the back of high demand, network fees may increase. Miners are paid these fees for the electricity and vast processing power required to process crypto transactions.

Wallet fees: This fee is similar to the demat fee that we pay for trading in shares. Cryptocurrencies are stored in a digital wallet, which is like an online bank account, meant for the safekeeping of the cryptocurrency. These digital wallets make it easier for you to use the cryptocurrency and send it to others.

Most of the wallets don’t charge any fee for holding the cryptocurrency but charge a fee at the time of withdrawing/sending cryptocurrency from the wallet which is basically network fees. ""We don't charge any fees on holding crypto in your WazirX wallet. We do charge crypto withdrawal fee and it is the lowest in India starting from zero fee,"" said Nischal Shetty of WazirX.

Worth mentioning here is that crypto wallets also offer systematic cryptocurrency buying options and have integrated merchant gateway service using which you can pay for transactions such as smartphone recharge, DTH recharge using cryptocurrency.","('https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/1564484114-cryptocurrency_getty.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,This map shows where cryptocurrency is taking off around the world,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/new-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-user-global-map.html,"Global adoption of cryptocurrency has taken off in the last year, up 881%, with Vietnam, India and Pakistan firmly in the lead, according to new data from Chainalysis. It is the second year the blockchain data firm has released its Global Crypto Adoption Index, which ranks 154 countries according to metrics such as peer-to-peer exchange trading volume, rather than gross transaction volume, which typically favors developed nations with high levels of professional and institutional crypto buy-in. Chainalysis said the purpose of the index is to capture crypto adoption by ""ordinary people"" and to ""focus on use cases related to transactions and individual saving, rather than trading and speculation."" The metrics are weighted to incorporate the wealth of the average person and the value of money generally within particular countries. Most of the top 20 countries are emerging economies, including Togo, Colombia and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the United States slipped from sixth to eighth place, and China, which cracked down on crypto this spring, dropped from fourth to 13th.

Chainalysis ascribes the rising adoption levels in emerging markets to a few key factors. For one, countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, Vietnam and Venezuela have huge transaction volumes on peer-to-peer, or P2P, platforms when adjusted for purchasing power parity per capita and the internet-using population. Chainalysis reports that many residents use P2P cryptocurrency exchanges as their primary on-ramp into cryptocurrency, often because they don't have access to centralized exchanges. The report also says many residents of these countries turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, as well as to send and receive remittances and carry out business transactions.

Matt Ahlborg, a peer-to-peer data analyst, told CNBC that Vietnam is one of the top markets for Bitrefill, a company that helps customers live on cryptocurrency by buying gift cards using bitcoin. ""Vietnam stood out to me because it dominated the index,"" said Chainalysis' director of research, Kim Grauer, who compiled the report. ""We heard from experts that people in Vietnam have a history of gambling, and the young, tech-savvy people don't have much to do with their funds in terms of investing in a traditional ETF, both of which drive crypto adoption,"" Grauer said. Nigeria is a different story, Grauer said. ""It has a huge commercial market for crypto. More and more commerce is done on the rails of cryptocurrency, including international trade with counter parties in China.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106930082-1629323396701-20210818-thumb-SKxR8-the-chainalysis-2021-global-crypto-adoption-index.png?v=1629323412',)",none
2021-08-23,The Motley Fool,Why Ethereum Is the Top Cryptocurrency Investment of 2021,https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/18/why-ethereum-is-the-top-cryptocurrency-investment/,"Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) has a lot going for it -- it's made some investors a bundle and it's an innovative utility coin. Investors who put money into Ethereum when it was introduced six years ago could be sitting on more than $1 million worth of profits today from an initial $1,000 investment. The coin also is the first programmable money in the world, storing instructions on the blockchain that self-execute when certain conditions are met, also known as smart contracts.

Ethereum is a major step forward from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), which only allow users to send money to one another. But more importantly, innovations are coming for Ethereum. Let's look at how this revolutionary coin might make a worthy addition to investors' portfolios.

A big step forward

Ethereum is about to undergo a significant transformation that fixes a mounting challenge for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin -- environmental sustainability. By the end of 2022, the Ethereum network will transition into one based on proof of stake (PoS) instead of proof of work (PoW). This means the network will no longer need miners using ever-more computing power to solve sophisticated, algorithmic puzzles to validate transactions on the blockchain ledger and create new coins. To put that into context, the global Bitcoin network now consumes as much energy as 23 coal-fired power plants -- and is growing day by day.

In theory, under the PoS regime, anyone will be able to validate transactions based on how many Ethereum -- their stake -- they own. The minimum requirement for staking is 32 ETH, or about $80,000. Under this setup, validators collect a network fee for their efforts, which is kind of like interest -- say 6% a year in the form of new tokens. In addition, the network also has the potential to expand to a delegated PoS network, where those who do not meet the minimum staking threshold can ""delegate"" their ETH to a staking pool for a fee to take part in validations. This move toward an eco-friendly model is a major bullish catalyst for Ethereum.

Growing recognition

Some of the biggest companies in the world are using Ethereum. For example, ING Group, a Dutch multinational bank with more than $1.1 trillion in assets, uses Ethereum to settle payments, bilateral lines of credit, and trading documents. In addition, TD Ameritrade, part of discount broker Charles Schwab Corp., is using Ethereum to facilitate smart contract future trades.

In another case, French video game titan Ubisoft Entertainment SA is using Ethereum as the basis for in-game purchases. Finally, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is looking to integrate its own digital coin (the JPM coin) with smart contracts via Ethereum.

The next revolution

It may not be obvious at first, but programmable money like Ethereum has the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct financial transactions. Right now, smart contracts are limited to the internal data on a blockchain, or the shared ledger of all transactions in a network. However, the rise of so-called oracle tokens like ChainLink is a major game-changer. ChainLink allows smart contracts to execute based on real-world API, or the link between computer programs and computers. This will free parties from the confines of the blockchain, letting them use just about anything -- futures data, stock prices, weather events, breaking news, economic indicators or video game achievements -- as reference points to settle Ethereum transactions.

The only problem with Ethereum is that, unlike Bitcoin, the coin does not have a supply ceiling. There now are more than 116.9 million ETH in circulation, with an annual rate of increase of about 4% a year as the supply of tokens rises. On Aug. 4, Ethereum developers unveiled five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) -- one of which was to reduce the mining reward so the rate of increase falls to about 3% a year. Because of its widespread adoption and revolutionary potential, capital inflows into Ethereum should surpass the lowered benchmark for the supply increase.



This development, along with the move to an environmentally sustainable model helps make Ethereum the leading cryptocurrencies to invest in for the long term.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/636870/gettyimages-1299252490.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,Ohio man pleads guilty to running $300 million bitcoin laundering conspiracy that helped drug traffickers,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/ohio-man-guilty-in-darknet-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-laundering-conspiracy.html,"An Ohio man pleaded guilty in a money laundering conspiracy in which he moved more than $300 million worth of bitcoin to help users, including drug traffickers, hide the source of their cryptocurrency.

Larry Dean Harmon, 38, of Akron, agreed as part of his plea in Washington, D.C., federal court to surrender more than 4,400 bitcoins, currently valued at more than $200 million, the Justice Department said Wednesday.

Harmon, who maintained a residence in the nation of Belize during his criminal activity, also faces assessment of a $60 million civil monetary penalty from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, authorities said.

He will be sentenced at a date to be scheduled. He faces a maximum prison term of 20 years and potential fines of hundreds of millions of dollars.

The Darknet is the collection of websites hidden from normal search engines and web browsers. Its anonymized nature is exploited by criminals who trade weapons, narcotics and illegal services.

As part of his guilty plea, Harmon admitted that his Darknet-based service, Helix, partnered with several Darknet markets, such as AlphaBay, Evolution and Cloud 9, to provide bitcoin money laundering services for customers, the Justice Department said.

Helix, which Harmon ran from 2014 through 2017, was known as a ""mixer"" or ""tumbler"" of bitcoin. For a fee, Helix would send bitcoin to recipients in a way that hid who was sending that cryptocurrency.

Helix was linked with and associated with a Darknet search called ""Grams,"" which was also run by Harmon, who ""advertised Helix to customers on the Darknet to conceal transactions from law enforcement,"" the Justice Department said.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929924-1629309517996-gettyimages-959428194-bs_4561.jpeg?v=1629309551',)",none
2021-08-23,MarketWatch,"Bitcoin is king of crypto but ‘Ethereum’s ascent to the top of the cryptoverse seems unstoppable,’ says analyst",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-is-king-of-crypto-but-ethereums-ascent-to-the-top-of-the-cryptoverse-seems-unstoppable-says-analyst-11629313818,"Bitcoin, the world’s No. 1 crypto and the genesis of the current revolution in digital assets may one day bow down to a new king of the sector, speculates a researcher.

“Ethereum will continue to outperform Bitcoin in 2021 and will, ultimately, exceed its rival’s value,” wrote Nigel Green, chief executive and founder of deVere Group, a large financial advisory firm and asset manager, in a Wednesday note.

Green makes the case that bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.48% which was launched in a white paper in 2008 may cede its dominance to Ethereum’s Ether ETHUSD, -2.04% , which is viewed by some as boasting a clearer use case than bitcoin which is considered by some as digital gold.

Bitcoin’s value in 2021 is up 57%, while Ether’s has risen 318%, at last check on CoinDesk.

By comparison, traditional assets have seen far more mundane returns. The S&P 500 index SPX has gained more than 18% in the year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA is up 15% thus far in 2021, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP has risen almost 14% and gold futuresGC00 are down almost 6%, FactSet data show.

Bitcoin’s major marketing point has been its claim by enthusiasts to be a store of value and as a currency to a lesser extent, but Ethereum’s network is viewed by many as a powerful, open-source, decentralized backbone off which a number of applications can be based.

Ether, launched in 2015 by a team including Vitarik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, and Gavin Wood, allows software developers to write bespoke programs atop its network. Sometimes these applications are referred to as smart contracts.

Ether bulls make the case that the world’s No. 2 crypto by market cap is the most in-demand development platform, thereby highlighting the Ethereum network’s “value not only as a platform for developers but as a worldwide financial utility,” wrote Green.

Ethereum also serves as the backbone of a number of popular and groundbreaking platforms, including decentralized finance networks, or DeFi, nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, and DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations.

Those growing uses have gummed up Ether’s works but that is seen changing in coming months.

A key upgrade to the Ether network, which includes a phased shift from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake and increased storage capacity and processing power for smart contracts, is under way.

Put simply, a proof-of-work network requires tremendous amounts of computing power to verify the distributed-ledger network, which is the foundation of traditional crypto, while a proof-of-stake requires proof of ownership and is considered more environmentally friendly because it reduces the carbon footprint of verifying transactions on the blockchain and paying out rewards to those “miners” who underpin the network.

The process of investors staking their Ether in preparation for the upgrade to Ethereum also has been credited in buoying prices of the digital asset.

“These upgrades represent a major boost not just for Ethereum but for blockchain technology itself,” writes Green. “Ultimately, this will mean that its value will exceed that of Bitcoin—probably within five years,” he predicts.

Green is hardly the first to speculate that Ether will supplant Ether one day. Industry enthusiasts even have a name for it: the flippening. The flippening is the day that Ethereum overtakes bitcoin in market value.

Still, bitcoin remains the dominant player, representing 44% of the nearly $1.96 trillion in crypto market value compared with Ether’s nearly 19%, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

To be sure, it is impossible to know which, if any, crypto will survive much less become the most dominant. Scrutiny of the sector is intensifying as regulators look to put up guardrails to protect would-be investors and central banks contemplate the use of central bank digital currencies and stablecoins, which could also pose existential threats to the extant array of crypto assets.","('https://images.mktw.net/im-319813/social',)",none
2021-08-23,The Verge,Cryptocurrency supporters are in the middle of their first big fight in Congress,https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631096/cryptocurrency-tax-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-advocacy-jack-dorsey-ashton-kutcher,"Last week, the Senate approved a massive infrastructure package making serious investments in building out the US’s roads and bridges. It would be the largest domestic spending bill in almost a decade, and nearly every powerful lobbying shop circled Washington for months trying to shape its language.

But one industry was surprisingly thrown into the fight last minute: cryptocurrency. When the Senate finally announced the bill text earlier this month, it included a provision that could impose devastating new tax requirements for wallet developers and miners. Suddenly, the cryptocurrency industry and its few lobbying shops faced one of its largest regulatory threats ever. They needed all of the digital foot soldiers they could get to help rally senators and fix the problematic language.

So, they turned to their vast and vocal online community of investors and posters.

“We are at an advantage in grassroots organizing because we’re a structurally networked community,” Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications for Coin Center, told The Verge. “Everybody in cryptocurrency knows everybody else for the most part so information moves really fast across various social channels.”

Advocacy groups and blockchain organizations were quickly able to direct their grassroots digital community’s energy toward the fight. Fight for the Future and the Electronic Frontier Foundation were able to prompt more than 40,000 calls to senators ahead of the bill’s final vote on the floor.

High-profile celebrities and influencers like Ashton Kutcher and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey also came out in opposition of the bill, posting tweets prompting their followers to call on their senators to fix the language. These tweets inspired other community members to take part in the effort by making calls and posting their own tweets with information from Fight for the Future.

“The reason this even became a conversation in Washington was because of Twitter”

“Senators who were probably not even paying very much attention to this section of the infrastructure bill suddenly saw their Twitter feeds swamped with messages from their own constituents,” said Rainey Reitman, EFF’s chief program officer. “It was so much they couldn’t ignore it.”

“The reason this even became a conversation in Washington was because of Twitter,” Reitman continued.

Even crypto-focused YouTubers and TikTok accounts pivoted toward advocacy, informing their followers about the bill and how it could affect the industry. One TikTok user posted a video dancing behind text that said, “Dance if ur an 87 year old senator single-handedly ruining the economy over a $50 billion military dispute,” calling out Sen. Richard Shelby’s (R-AL) objection to an amendment to fix the language.

It’s a surprising shift for an industry that has typically been an outsider in Washington, often directly opposed to well-established players like law enforcement and the banking industry. But as digital assets companies have been drawn into regulatory fights, they’ve had to engage with the process to defend themselves, whether against regulators calling for more authority over the industry or a growing concern over ransomware attacks.

The new push drew heavily on infrastructure from previous online organizing drives. The 2017 net neutrality fight was fought largely online with organizations like Fight for the Future and EFF using social media to prompt internet users to get involved in a policy battle that affected their favorite websites. Once the controversial language was added to the infrastructure bill, those same groups used the tactics they’d perfected in the net neutrality fight to push back.

Reitman says the shift to digital organizing has also been a factor, as cryptocurrency fans “are using online platforms like Twitter and Hacker News to educate themselves, educate other people, and then start speaking out about regulation.”

Even with the heightened political pressure, it’s too early to say where Congress will land on the new cryptocurrency rules. Cryptography groups failed to stop the provisions in the Senate, and all hopes now rest on stripping the language from the House version of the bill. As of publication, it’s unclear if congresspeople will have one last opportunity to amend the bill before it reaches its final vote.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) faces an uphill battle in passing the infrastructure package at all. Progressive members say they won’t vote for the Senate-passed $1 trillion package unless it’s tied to a broader $3.5 trillion social services bill. Some moderate Democrats pushed back, saying they wouldn’t vote to begin writing the larger bill unless the infrastructure package is approved first. If the two bills get tied together, it could make it harder for any lawmaker to bring an amendment to change the cryptocurrency language to the floor.

Still, last week’s organizing efforts proved that the cryptocurrency community has grown into an impressive political force in Washington.

“It was really amazing to see how quickly they were able to turn that functionality on and get so many people involved,” Kristin Smith, executive director at the Blockchain Association said. “It’s definitely a turning point for the industry and I think one that will hopefully lead to better policy down the road.”","('https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qpi1xpu-tvrhRnJQgN3tAwIM0WI=/0x148:2048x1220/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20086199/VRG_ILLO_1777_twitter_bitcoin.0.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Mint,India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption in the world,https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/india-ranks-second-in-terms-of-crypto-adoption-in-the-world-11629306088082.html,"NEW DELHI : India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption worldwide behind Vietnam, but ahead of countries such as the US, UK, and China, according to the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

This comes even as worldwide crypto adoption grew by 880% between June 2020 and July 2021, according to the report.

A report by US-based research platform Finder released this month corroborated that the top five countries in terms of crypto adoption were all from Asia.

The company surveyed 47,000 users worldwide and 30% of those surveyed in India said they owned cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the most popular coin in India, followed by Ripple, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash, according to the report.

India’s “huge expatriate population"" makes it the world’s number one remittance recipient in the crypto space, Finder said. India had the largest expatriate population in the world, with 18 million people from the country living outside their homeland last year, noted a January 2021 UN report.

Crypto adoption in India has also been led by smaller towns in the country. The largest crypto exchange in the country by trading volume, WazirX, said last week that it had seen more than 2,648% growth in user sign-ups from tier II and tier III cities in India.

The exchange has a claimed user base of 7.3 million users and said it has clocked more than $21.8 billion in trading volumes this year.

Competitor Coinswitch Kuber, which ranks among the top crypto exchanges in India by trading volumes, noted the same trend. It saw a 135% monthly growth in user sign-ups from smaller towns, which made up 61% of the exchange’s total business. Trading volumes from these cities in the last six months were close to ₹431 billion, said Sharan Nair, chief business officer of the company.

The interest is mostly driven by referrals, said Naimish Sanghvi, who has been running crypto information platform Coin Crunch since 2018. The fact that cryptocurrencies have made money for many individuals almost overnight has drawn more such users to the space, especially from smaller towns, he said. However, serious investors who will get in the space for the long term are yet to really take interest.
