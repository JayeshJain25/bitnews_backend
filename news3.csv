2021-09-09,Yahoo Finance,Proof-of-stake: Ethereum 2.0 ranks worst energy consumption,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/proof-stake-ethereum-2-0-153221744.html,"Groundbreaking research by University College London has systematically assessed the energy consumptions of leading proof-of-stake networks and concluded not all PoS blockchains are created equal.

Proof-of-stake has been heralded as the environmental saviour of the crypto industry, emerging as the rousing response to widespread attempts at decrying blockchain technology on the basis of its environmental impact.

Forecast as the future of the industry, there are many projects racing to become the dominant PoS blockchain system, including Cardano (ADA), Algorand (ALGO), Tezos (XTZ), and Celo (CELO).

The Ethereum network is rapidly approaching its own PoS standard – Ethereum 2.0 – following a successful London hard fork. It is expected to launch sometime this winter.

What is proof of stake?

PoS technology allows a circumvention of the energy-intensive cryptographic problem solving needed to mine cryptocurrencies in Proof of Work (PoW) systems. It allows owners to stake their tokens as collateral in order to validate transactions by consensus on the network in exchange for rewards, this often takes place in large public pools.

In effect, this means that PoS doesn’t require extra energy to prove trustworthiness, reducing the overall energy consumption of the network substantially.

Energy consumption ranked

UCL’s Centre for Blockchain Technology is among the first in the world to publish cutting edge research into second-generation consensus models.

The overall rankings produced for proof of stake networks’ energy consumption per transaction is as follows:

Hedera – HBAR Tezos – XTZ Polkadot – DOT Cardano – ADA Algorand – ALGO Ethereum 2.0 – ETH 2.0

Needless to say, Cardano chief Charles Hoskinson will be relieved to see ADA score as being more energy efficient than rival Ethereum.

The news also coincided with an ALGO price surge of 30%.

No doubt the review of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) can also be tied to the university’s prominent position on the Hedera Governing council, which aims to bring together global experts to manage decentralisation efforts.

Story continues

Proof of Stake Energy Consumption UCL Centre for Blockchain Technology

The above table shows the data produced for the global energy consumption of each distributed ledger technology network tested, alongside the per transaction calculation.

Energy Consumption Per Transaction UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies Proof of Stake consumption

Another interesting table from the report visually demonstrates the relative energy consumption of transactions between different proof of stake technologies relative to Bitcoin.

Dr Paolo Tasca, the executive director of UCL’s Centre for Blockchain and Technologies, suggested the research highlights the importance of investors fully understanding the ramifications of the technologies they’re investing in.

“At this point, the benefits of proof-of-stake are well recognised and understood in the blockchain space,” he said.

“However, through this research we have found that not all Proof-of-Stake networks are created

equally.

“This is something that both investors and adopters need to be wary of when selecting their network of choice… looking at these results it’s clear that we need to remain vigilant of potential environmental impact.”

Ultimately, the research revealed that the biggest interplay was between the number of active network validators and the scale of environmental consumption.

This means that if DLT PoS networks are to successfully reduce energy consumption and environmental impact, then it will be necessary to focus efforts on the the influence of design choices in network architecture and the efficiency of hardware used specifically by validators.

Is It A Good Time To Invest?,https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/other-tech-news/ethereum-classic-price-prediction-why-is-etc-going-down-is-it-a-good-time-to-invest.html,"While the cryptocurrency market was blooming with a positive growth rate, it went down a steep fall of over $300 billion between Tuesday, September 7, 2021, to September 8, 2021. While Etheruem Classic coin value touched $76.94 on September 6, 2021, it fell down to $52.02 the very next day. Currently, the price of one Etherium Classic coin is $58.22, and it has seen a negative change rate of 4.43% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum Classis's trading volume has fallen over 71.40% in the last 24 hours and the cryptocurrency now holds a market cap of over $7.5 billion. A 24 hour low and high price of Ethereum Classis is $53.62 and $60.73 respectively. However, an all-time high value of the coin is still a long way to go, which was recorded in May 2021 at $176.16. There are over 130 million ETH coins in circulation. Keep reading to know more about Ethereum Classic price prediction.

Ethereum Classic price prediction 2022-2025

According to CoinPriceForecast, the price of Ethereum Classic will reach $75 by the end of 2022 and $100 by mid-2023. Additionally, the mid-year price for 2025 is predicted to be $162.39. According to WalletInvestor, the cryptocurrency will reach about $116 in one year and $291 in the next five years. According to Gov.Capital, the price of Ethereum Classic is supposed to rise to about $76.36 in one year. That being said, it might be a good time to invest in ETC, given that the prices are low.

Why is Ethereum Classic etc doing down?

According to the official Ethereum Classic Twitter page, the Geth exploit causes about 20% of the network to fall down. According to a recent report by CoinFomania, ""an unknown hacker exploited a bug in older versions of a popular Ethereum network client, Go Ethereum (Geth for short). ... It seems that someone found the bug we fixed in @go_ethereum v1. 10.8 and exploited it causing all geth nodes with earlier versions to split from the network."" This might be one of the causes that caused a decline in the price of Ethereum Classis price. However, the cryptocurrency network recovered as well. The Ehtereum Classic market cap still stands strong at over $7 billion. The coin has a total supply of over 210 million.","('https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/ytm5czxjndq6fxo6_1631158149.jpeg',)",none

Top Cryptocurrency Rates",https://www.news18.com/news/business/bitcoin-ether-cardano-prices-drop-for-second-day-in-a-row-top-cryptocurrency-rates-4181732.html,"Bitcoin on Thursday plunged to $45,813.90, down 2.80 per cent. On the other hand , Ethereum, the rival currency of Bitcoin, slid to $3,474.44, down 1.13 per cent. The total market cap of both Bitcoin and Ethereum stands at $861.7 billion, $408.062 billion respectively. This fall in the cryptocurrency market was partially led by El Salvador, a Latin American country which became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. This large-scale adoption of Bitcoin across the country created a baffling situation. Many surveys in the country have shown that people of the country are skeptical and doubtful to use Bitcoin, because of its volatile nature.

On Monday, El Salvador bought its first 400 of the cryptocurrency, temporarily pushing prices for bitcoin 1.49 percent higher to more than $52,680.

As of Thursday , the global crypto market cap is standing at $2.09 trillion which marks a decrease of 1.11 per cent over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $179.80 billion which makes a 25.59 percent decrease. The total volume in DeFi is currently $23.66 billion , 13.16 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins is now $140.74 billion, which is 78.28 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. On the other hand, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s dominance took a beating by 0.60 per cent and is currently standing at 41.39 per cent.

Cardano was trading at $2.40, down 5.65 per cent, however, Dogecoin was trading at $0.2514, down 3.62 per cent.

“After a choppy session on Tuesday, the crypto market showed faint signs of recovery over the past 24 hours. BTC hovered above the $46,000 level, whereas the Altcoins continued to remain under pressure. Sellers are pretty active and looking to capitalize on another possible breakdown. But the bulls have managed to hold the support levels so far. The largest Altcoijn, Ether, rose marginally and hovered close to the $3500 mark.” Edu Patel, CEO and co-founder, Mudrex-A Global Crypto Trading Platform said.

However, here in India, after Raghuram Rajan, former RBI Deputy Governor R Gandhi while speaking at an event said that Cryptocurrencies should be paid for through normal payment channels. If they are not, then it should be deemed as mined and capital gains tax must be levied. That is like voluntary disclosure. The transactions should be fully tracked through a repository. He also focused on whether this currency should be declared as an asset or commodity.

“Technical indicators signal increased volatility across the markets. Bollinger bands are expanding, and we could expect the volatility to continue in the short term. Algorand was one of the showstoppers yesterday after rising almost 45 per cent and entering the list of top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Several estimates suggest that ALGO might be the preferred blockchain platform for building the Central Bank Digital Currencies or CBDCs. The total crypto market cap stands at approximately $2.08 trillion, a marginal decrease of 2.03 per cent over the previous day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $193.23B, which makes an 11.14 per cent decrease. The total volume in DeFi is currently $26.14B, 13.53 per cent of the total crypto market cap,” Patel said.

India's federal ministerial panel will consider a proposed legislation on cryptocurrencies with national security in mind, a Bharatiya Janata Party MP said.

""We have to be very watchful about what happens to these crypto assets and cryptocurrencies,"" Jayant Sinha, chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, said Wednesday. ""Use of these kind of crypto instruments in terror financing and for domestic security threats is something we have to be mindful of.""

He ruled out replicating advanced economies on virtual currencies as the nation still doesn't have a full capital account convertibility.

India's approach toward cryptocurrencies has evolved over time, going from being virtually outlawed to being reinstated by the court, which termed the curbs as illegal. Mr Sinha's comments come a day after a former Indian central banker said cryptocurrencies should be treated as an asset or commodity and governed by existing laws for exchanges.

""Our solution will have to be distinct and unique simply because of our unique circumstances,"" Mr Sinha said.

2021-09-09,Taiwan News,Cryptocurrency and Millennials—The Perfect Match: An Expert Article by OctaFX,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4283475,"KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA - Media OutReach - 9 September 2021 - From the standpoint of technological adaptability, Millennials are among the groups which were able to adjust the most in a brief period of time—a time that is torn and accelerated anew by paradigm shifts all over the board. The older ones (born between 1980–1993) received insights from the preceding generations and accommodated to the best of their ability: lessons that remained from the preceding Gen X's beliefs and habits and what their Baby boomer parents taught. Organic intergenerational exchange is now juxtaposed with exponential technological progress. The reality is, Millennials suffered a clash because of this energetic ambiguity. As a result, they stumbled into a whole new era where everything they've been taught has been distorted and tested. A test that already shows many fruits and reasons to believe that Millennials readjusted swiftly.









The prior generations' values about work, savings, lifestyle, and investments have radically shifted to different priorities. They appreciate investing in new technologies, have other behavioural habits, preferences and expectations towards their future.





Many of them are under the justified impression that merely finishing a bachelor's degree is not enough to find a fulfilling job and the salary of their dreams, as maybe their parents did.

Millennial traders are the most ambitious

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the future of the financial market is uncertain. One age group that seems to take advantage of this web of uncertainties, however, are millennials. Even though it might sound redundant, Millennials become more and more proficient in dealing with uncertainty at their best. A well-known characteristic of Millennials is their desire for aspirations to be fulfilled rapidly, no time wasted. Be it the morning news, dinner plans, or instant gratifications from their physical achievements in their jogging app—all rest comfortably at their disposal through a simple swipe or click on their smartphone.





We observe similar strives in today's fintech domain, evolving at par with this generation. For instance, the fact of digital and branchless banks challenging traditional bank structures.

Cryptocurrency—the most popular digital asset

As some also refer to Millennials, Generation Y has a reputation for embracing all things digital, especially cryptocurrencies. So when it comes to investments, most prefer doing things online or over an app rather than filling up lengthy paperwork. Cryptocurrencies emerged a little over a decade ago, with the first taking the spotlight in 2009: bitcoin. These novel assets became a diverse basket of tokens and coins, thriving from blockchain technology—a prospective and growing alternative to our current legacy financial system. It basically means that cryptocurrencies can be purchased, sold, exchanged, or stored by anyone, digitally, online with the aid of the blockchain. It is a unique database that has so far proved to be virtually incorruptible, with a natural affinity for decentralisation and self-responsibility. Many of these blockchain projects releasing new cryptocurrencies every year yielded unfathomable results and growth. (Not all of them on merits of their innovation, of course, but rather because they were hyped into oblivion by clever marketing.)

These attributes might display why cryptocurrency as an asset class fits perfectly into the Millennial lifestyle. For anyone still wondering why Millennials would invest in cryptocurrencies, here are some excellent reasons:





● High and quick returns (Millennials are considered one of the most ambitious generations, historically speaking. They seek investments that benefit them with high returns in a shorter duration. While there are not many assets that generate high returns quickly, cryptocurrency can be an exception.)

● A bonus to a decent retirement portfolio

Concerning the last point, it's even more severe. Unlike their parents (depending on the country they live in), most Millennials in Latin America, for instance, are a generation without access to a future pension assured by the state. Even those who hold good jobs now are not likely to receive a pension once retirement starts. This urge to take matters into one's own hands, making long-term investments, is driven by the possibility of reaching independence and financial freedom.

Cryptocurrency is highly volatile. The fact that sometimes its 30-day gains or losses can exceed 100% is a testament to that. Meaning, the risk and returns are relatively high. However, if played out wisely, they can make a great addition to a Millennial's retirement portfolio. In that sense, the statistics already show how Gen Y demographics often seek other incomes than just what their official jobs generate. That's why it is imperative to consider which platform gives the best conditions and security to avoid precarious situations. A service that can help them generate even more additional income on which they can rely.





Also, studies have shown that the pandemic has increased the risk appetite among Millennials significantly. Here is a paradox: They remain a relatively young generation that is not very worried about liabilities since, on the one hand, they don't have a whole lot to lose and starting over does not seem like that much of a tragedy. On the other hand, they`re used to sudden changes and have come to deal with these in a surprisingly determined and organised manner.

A suitable Alternative Investment

The term 'Alternative Investment' means performance is unrelated to traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds. Cryptocurrency can make for an alternative investment for Millennials over the long term since they are likely to remain strong and pull through any financial crisis that may occur in the future—particularly if the fundamentals, use case, partnerships, and innovation of the blockchain project hold up.

So, how to invest safely? The first step is finding a reliable and trustworthy exchange for cryptocurrencies. Simplicity, security, and accessibility are three aspects that everyone should consider while choosing an exchange to invest in crypto. Before ever trying to buy any asset with your hard-earned money, make sure the platform is legit.

Many lost orientation and perspective due to the great crashes in the crypto market, like back in March 2020, or more recently, in May 2021. When the typical Elon Musk tweet hits home and provokes severe market fluctuations, some of the best platforms should be able and willing to give guidance and adapt to their customers' needs.





OctaFX is one of those platforms.





The fintech company just recently accommodated its clients with a leverage update:

it raised the leverage for all its cryptocurrency pairs from 1:10 to 1:25.





As a friendly reminder, the most-traded cryptocurrencies at OctaFX, ranked by popularity, are:

BTCUSD (Bitcoin/U.S. dollar)

XRPUSD (Ripple/U.S. dollar)

ETHUSD (Ethereum/U.S. dollar)

LTCUSD (Litecoin/U.S. dollar)

BCHUSD (Bitcoin Cash/U.S. dollar)

OctaFX decided upon meeting this customer demand after carefully analysing the client sentiment and attentively reviewing client communications.

The cryptocurrency adventure is a wild one and plays a decisive role in ushering in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Thanks to Millennials or Generation Y, it gathered momentum never seen before on any financial market and has to be reckoned with in the future.

2021-09-09,ABC,Regulators threaten to sue cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase; $30 billion wiped off the ASX,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-09/asx-wallstreeet-currencies-commodities/100445648,"Digital currency trading firm Coinbase will be sued by the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, if the company goes ahead with plans for a cryptocurrency lending scheme.

Key points: Coinbase is threatened with legal action by the SEC over its new loan product

Coinbase is threatened with legal action by the SEC over its new loan product The Dow Jones index has dropped 0.2pc, to 35,031, the S&P 500 has fallen 0.13pc, to 4,514, and the Nasdaq has lost 0.6pc, to 15,286

The Dow Jones index has dropped 0.2pc, to 35,031, the S&P 500 has fallen 0.13pc, to 4,514, and the Nasdaq has lost 0.6pc, to 15,286 Meanwhile, ASX SPI 200 index has fallen 0.5pc, to 7,478, while the Australian dollar lost ground, to 73.65 US cents

The lending program would allow users to earn interest by lending digital money, but the SEC has classified the product as an investment security.

Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, said the SEC told the company last week that it intended to legally charge Coinbase, so the firm planned to delay the launch of its ""Lend"" product until at least October.

The company's chief executive officer, Brian Armstrong, took to Twitter to slam the agency's handling of the firm's plans to roll out the product and said the agency had denied him a meeting.

An SEC official told Reuters that the agency had held discussions with Coinbase.

Both its chief executive officer and its chief legal officer said that Coinbase disputed the SEC's determination.

""'Lend' is not an investment contract or note,"" they said.

The executive's remarks provide a glimpse into the rising tension between the cryptocurrency industry and regulators.

SEC chairman Gary Gensler has described the industry as a ""Wild West"", riddled with fraud and investor risk.

Mr Gensler has said some digital assets and platforms were operating as, or offering, securities, bringing them under the SEC's oversight.

Coinbase shares fell 3.2 per cent, to $US258.20.

Bitcoin rose 0.3 per cent, to $46,270 per digital coin.

Australian stocks take a hit

Meanwhile, the local share market tumbled after a fall overnight on Wall Street, with weaker mining stocks after the iron ore price fell, and a number of companies traded ex-dividend.

At 12:50pm AEST, the All Ordinaries lost 1.5 per cent of its value to 7,693.

Chief investment officer at Burman Invest, Julia Lee, said the losses on the All Ordinaries index amounted to around $30 billion at lunchtime. However, Ms Lee noted that stock markets were trading near record highs and were due for a correction, which is when a stock market falls at least 10 per cent from its peak.

""The concern is that Delta is eating into economic growth,"" she said.

Big miners and industrial stocks weighed on the market after the price of iron ore fell more than 4 per cent overnight to $US130.70 a tonne.

Rio Tinto lost 2.3per cent, BHP fell 1.5 per cent and Fortescue Metals declined by 0.3 per cent by 12:40pm AEST.

""It's those miners that are doing a lot of the damage today,"" Ms Lee said.

""And that's on concerns that iron ore prices will keep on falling and that's as Beijing clamps down on steel production for environmental reasons ahead of the Winter Olympics in February next year.""

At 12:50pm AEST, just 13 stocks were higher on the ASX 200, three were steady and 184 were making losses.

The benchmark index was down 1.5 per cent to 7,399 at 12:50pm AEST with all industry sectors in the red.

Leading the falls on the ASX 200 were litigation funder Omni Bridgeway (-5.9pc), financial firm Virgin Money (-6.9pc) and lithium miner Orocobre (-5.2pc).

Going up were medical device firm Resmed (+2.3pc), miner Whitehaven Coal (+2.4pc) and gold miner Gold Road Resources (+1pc).

The Australian dollar dropped 0.1 per cent to around 73.59 US cents at 12:50pm AEST.

NAB says Delta taking its toll

The National Australia Bank said there has been a huge reduction in borrowers deferring repayments on their loans since last year's COVID-19 shutdowns because the current lockdowns had been less financially damaging.

Ross McEwan has told a parliamentary committee that, at the end of August, around $1.8 billion worth of loans were deferred, compared to $58 billion at the height of the pandemic last year.

""Our position remains that a good business before COVID will most likely be a good business going forward,"" Mr McEwan said.

However, he said, the number of customers in financial hardship had risen since the outbreak of the Delta variant of the virus.

""Many businesses are in a state of hibernation, waiting for restrictions to open up and ready to get going again,"" he said.

""For others — in particular, small business customers in Sydney and Melbourne CBDs — the situation is more fragile.""

Mr McEwan also said that Australia needed its own national vaccine pass — as in European countries — that was ready to launch when 80 per cent of the population is double-vaccinated.

""Current forecasts show 80 per cent of eligible Australians will have had their first jab within three weeks, and their second jab by mid-November,"" Mr McEwan said.

""This is our light at the end of the tunnel. Our communities need hope. Our businesses need clarity, to plan for the future.""

NAB shares were down 1.5 per cent to $28.42 at 12:50pm AEST.

Commodities mixed

ANZ economists said crude oil prices gained overnight as supply issues plague the market, with US production struggling to recover from Hurricane Ida.

The US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said more than three-quarters of production remained shut in the Gulf of Mexico.

Brent crude slipped back in morning trade, to $US72.51 a barrel, while spot gold was weighed down by the stronger US dollar.

It traded around $US1789.53 an ounce as it steadied in Asian trade.

US stocks taper

Trade on Wall Street pulled back as investors worried about rising COVID-19 cases around the world as well as the timing of the US Federal Reserve's plan to ease back on its pandemic stimulus.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.20 per cent, to 35,031, the S&P 500 dropped 0.13 per cent, to 4,514, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.6 per cent, to 15,286.

Six of the 11 S&P 500 sector indices fell, with materials and energy the deepest decliners, down more than 1 per cent each.

Apple (-1pc) and Facebook (-1.2pc) fell after helping push the Nasdaq index to record highs in the previous session.

Digital currency platform Coinbase dropped after the corporate regulator the Securities Exchange Commission threatened to sue it.

Payments firm Paypal fell after buying a Japanese buy now, pay later company.

The dips in those two Silicon Valley giants contributed more than any other companies to the S&P 500's decline for the session.

Investors have become more cautious after Friday's weak August payrolls data, while pressures from rising costs, despite the economy slowing, have increased concerns that the Fed could move sooner than expected to scale back massive monetary measures enacted last year to shield the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.

In its latest Beige Book report, the Federal Reserve said the North American economy had ""downshifted slightly"" in August as concerns grew over how the renewed surge of COVID-19 cases would affect the economy's recovery.

Chief investment strategist at CFRA Sam Stovall said shareholders were hedging their bets.

""Investors are pulling petals from a daisy, saying, 'The economy will grow, the economy won't grow'.""

""They can't make up their minds, so they have not committed to long-term positions.""

St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president James Bullard told the Financial Times that the Fed should move forward with a plan to trim its pandemic stimulus program despite a slowdown in job growth.

European markets weaker

Across the Atlantic, European shares fell on jitters that the European Central Bank will start to roll back its pandemic stimulus.

The FTSE 100 index lost 0.8 per cent, to 7,096 , the DAX in Germany fell 1.5 per cent, to 15,610, while the CAC 40 in Paris 6,669, down 0.9 per cent.

The ASX SPI 200 index has fallen 0.5pc, to 7,478, while the Australian dollar lost ground to 73.65 US cents.

2021-09-09,Yahoo Finance,Proof-of-stake: Ethereum 2.0 ranks worst energy consumption,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/proof-stake-ethereum-2-0-153221744.html,"Groundbreaking research by University College London has systematically assessed the energy consumptions of leading proof-of-stake networks and concluded not all PoS blockchains are created equal.

Proof-of-stake has been heralded as the environmental saviour of the crypto industry, emerging as the rousing response to widespread attempts at decrying blockchain technology on the basis of its environmental impact.

Forecast as the future of the industry, there are many projects racing to become the dominant PoS blockchain system, including Cardano (ADA), Algorand (ALGO), Tezos (XTZ), and Celo (CELO).

The Ethereum network is rapidly approaching its own PoS standard – Ethereum 2.0 – following a successful London hard fork. It is expected to launch sometime this winter.

What is proof of stake?

PoS technology allows a circumvention of the energy-intensive cryptographic problem solving needed to mine cryptocurrencies in Proof of Work (PoW) systems. It allows owners to stake their tokens as collateral in order to validate transactions by consensus on the network in exchange for rewards, this often takes place in large public pools.

In effect, this means that PoS doesn’t require extra energy to prove trustworthiness, reducing the overall energy consumption of the network substantially.

Energy consumption ranked

UCL’s Centre for Blockchain Technology is among the first in the world to publish cutting edge research into second-generation consensus models.

The overall rankings produced for proof of stake networks’ energy consumption per transaction is as follows:

Hedera – HBAR Tezos – XTZ Polkadot – DOT Cardano – ADA Algorand – ALGO Ethereum 2.0 – ETH 2.0

Needless to say, Cardano chief Charles Hoskinson will be relieved to see ADA score as being more energy efficient than rival Ethereum.

The news also coincided with an ALGO price surge of 30%.

No doubt the review of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) can also be tied to the university’s prominent position on the Hedera Governing council, which aims to bring together global experts to manage decentralisation efforts.

Story continues

Proof of Stake Energy Consumption UCL Centre for Blockchain Technology

The above table shows the data produced for the global energy consumption of each distributed ledger technology network tested, alongside the per transaction calculation.

Energy Consumption Per Transaction UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies Proof of Stake consumption

Another interesting table from the report visually demonstrates the relative energy consumption of transactions between different proof of stake technologies relative to Bitcoin.

Dr Paolo Tasca, the executive director of UCL’s Centre for Blockchain and Technologies, suggested the research highlights the importance of investors fully understanding the ramifications of the technologies they’re investing in.

“At this point, the benefits of proof-of-stake are well recognised and understood in the blockchain space,” he said.

“However, through this research we have found that not all Proof-of-Stake networks are created

equally.

“This is something that both investors and adopters need to be wary of when selecting their network of choice… looking at these results it’s clear that we need to remain vigilant of potential environmental impact.”

Ultimately, the research revealed that the biggest interplay was between the number of active network validators and the scale of environmental consumption.

This means that if DLT PoS networks are to successfully reduce energy consumption and environmental impact, then it will be necessary to focus efforts on the the influence of design choices in network architecture and the efficiency of hardware used specifically by validators.

While Etheruem Classic coin value touched $76.94 on September 6, 2021, it fell down to $52.02 the very next day. Currently, the price of one Etherium Classic coin is $58.22, and it has seen a negative change rate of 4.43% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum Classis's trading volume has fallen over 71.40% in the last 24 hours and the cryptocurrency now holds a market cap of over $7.5 billion. A 24 hour low and high price of Ethereum Classis is $53.62 and $60.73 respectively. However, an all-time high value of the coin is still a long way to go, which was recorded in May 2021 at $176.16. There are over 130 million ETH coins in circulation. Keep reading to know more about Ethereum Classic price prediction.

Ethereum Classic price prediction 2022-2025

According to CoinPriceForecast, the price of Ethereum Classic will reach $75 by the end of 2022 and $100 by mid-2023. Additionally, the mid-year price for 2025 is predicted to be $162.39. According to WalletInvestor, the cryptocurrency will reach about $116 in one year and $291 in the next five years. According to Gov.Capital, the price of Ethereum Classic is supposed to rise to about $76.36 in one year. That being said, it might be a good time to invest in ETC, given that the prices are low.

Why is Ethereum Classic etc doing down?

According to the official Ethereum Classic Twitter page, the Geth exploit causes about 20% of the network to fall down. According to a recent report by CoinFomania, ""an unknown hacker exploited a bug in older versions of a popular Ethereum network client, Go Ethereum (Geth for short). ... It seems that someone found the bug we fixed in @go_ethereum v1. 10.8 and exploited it causing all geth nodes with earlier versions to split from the network."" This might be one of the causes that caused a decline in the price of Ethereum Classis price. However, the cryptocurrency network recovered as well. The Ehtereum Classic market cap still stands strong at over $7 billion. The coin has a total supply of over 210 million.","('https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/ytm5czxjndq6fxo6_1631158149.jpeg',)",none

Top Cryptocurrency Rates",https://www.news18.com/news/business/bitcoin-ether-cardano-prices-drop-for-second-day-in-a-row-top-cryptocurrency-rates-4181732.html,"Bitcoin on Thursday plunged to $45,813.90, down 2.80 per cent. On the other hand , Ethereum, the rival currency of Bitcoin, slid to $3,474.44, down 1.13 per cent. The total market cap of both Bitcoin and Ethereum stands at $861.7 billion, $408.062 billion respectively. This fall in the cryptocurrency market was partially led by El Salvador, a Latin American country which became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. This large-scale adoption of Bitcoin across the country created a baffling situation. Many surveys in the country have shown that people of the country are skeptical and doubtful to use Bitcoin, because of its volatile nature.

On Monday, El Salvador bought its first 400 of the cryptocurrency, temporarily pushing prices for bitcoin 1.49 percent higher to more than $52,680.

As of Thursday , the global crypto market cap is standing at $2.09 trillion which marks a decrease of 1.11 per cent over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $179.80 billion which makes a 25.59 percent decrease. The total volume in DeFi is currently $23.66 billion , 13.16 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins is now $140.74 billion, which is 78.28 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. On the other hand, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s dominance took a beating by 0.60 per cent and is currently standing at 41.39 per cent.

Cardano was trading at $2.40, down 5.65 per cent, however, Dogecoin was trading at $0.2514, down 3.62 per cent.

“After a choppy session on Tuesday, the crypto market showed faint signs of recovery over the past 24 hours. BTC hovered above the $46,000 level, whereas the Altcoins continued to remain under pressure. Sellers are pretty active and looking to capitalize on another possible breakdown. But the bulls have managed to hold the support levels so far. The largest Altcoijn, Ether, rose marginally and hovered close to the $3500 mark.” Edu Patel, CEO and co-founder, Mudrex-A Global Crypto Trading Platform said.

However, here in India, after Raghuram Rajan, former RBI Deputy Governor R Gandhi while speaking at an event said that Cryptocurrencies should be paid for through normal payment channels. If they are not, then it should be deemed as mined and capital gains tax must be levied. That is like voluntary disclosure. The transactions should be fully tracked through a repository. He also focused on whether this currency should be declared as an asset or commodity.

“Technical indicators signal increased volatility across the markets. Bollinger bands are expanding, and we could expect the volatility to continue in the short term. Algorand was one of the showstoppers yesterday after rising almost 45 per cent and entering the list of top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Several estimates suggest that ALGO might be the preferred blockchain platform for building the Central Bank Digital Currencies or CBDCs. The total crypto market cap stands at approximately $2.08 trillion, a marginal decrease of 2.03 per cent over the previous day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $193.23B, which makes an 11.14 per cent decrease. The total volume in DeFi is currently $26.14B, 13.53 per cent of the total crypto market cap,” Patel said.

India's federal ministerial panel will consider a proposed legislation on cryptocurrencies with national security in mind, a Bharatiya Janata Party MP said.

He ruled out replicating advanced economies on virtual currencies as the nation still doesn't have a full capital account convertibility.

India's approach toward cryptocurrencies has evolved over time, going from being virtually outlawed to being reinstated by the court, which termed the curbs as illegal. Mr Sinha's comments come a day after a former Indian central banker said cryptocurrencies should be treated as an asset or commodity and governed by existing laws for exchanges.

2021-09-09,Taiwan News,Cryptocurrency and Millennials—The Perfect Match: An Expert Article by OctaFX,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4283475,"KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA - Media OutReach - 9 September 2021 - From the standpoint of technological adaptability, Millennials are among the groups which were able to adjust the most in a brief period of time—a time that is torn and accelerated anew by paradigm shifts all over the board. The older ones (born between 1980–1993) received insights from the preceding generations and accommodated to the best of their ability: lessons that remained from the preceding Gen X's beliefs and habits and what their Baby boomer parents taught. Organic intergenerational exchange is now juxtaposed with exponential technological progress. The reality is, Millennials suffered a clash because of this energetic ambiguity. As a result, they stumbled into a whole new era where everything they've been taught has been distorted and tested. A test that already shows many fruits and reasons to believe that Millennials readjusted swiftly.









The prior generations' values about work, savings, lifestyle, and investments have radically shifted to different priorities. They appreciate investing in new technologies, have other behavioural habits, preferences and expectations towards their future.





Many of them are under the justified impression that merely finishing a bachelor's degree is not enough to find a fulfilling job and the salary of their dreams, as maybe their parents did.

Millennial traders are the most ambitious

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the future of the financial market is uncertain. One age group that seems to take advantage of this web of uncertainties, however, are millennials. Even though it might sound redundant, Millennials become more and more proficient in dealing with uncertainty at their best. A well-known characteristic of Millennials is their desire for aspirations to be fulfilled rapidly, no time wasted. Be it the morning news, dinner plans, or instant gratifications from their physical achievements in their jogging app—all rest comfortably at their disposal through a simple swipe or click on their smartphone.





We observe similar strives in today's fintech domain, evolving at par with this generation. For instance, the fact of digital and branchless banks challenging traditional bank structures.

Cryptocurrency—the most popular digital asset

As some also refer to Millennials, Generation Y has a reputation for embracing all things digital, especially cryptocurrencies. So when it comes to investments, most prefer doing things online or over an app rather than filling up lengthy paperwork. Cryptocurrencies emerged a little over a decade ago, with the first taking the spotlight in 2009: bitcoin. These novel assets became a diverse basket of tokens and coins, thriving from blockchain technology—a prospective and growing alternative to our current legacy financial system. It basically means that cryptocurrencies can be purchased, sold, exchanged, or stored by anyone, digitally, online with the aid of the blockchain. It is a unique database that has so far proved to be virtually incorruptible, with a natural affinity for decentralisation and self-responsibility. Many of these blockchain projects releasing new cryptocurrencies every year yielded unfathomable results and growth. (Not all of them on merits of their innovation, of course, but rather because they were hyped into oblivion by clever marketing.)

These attributes might display why cryptocurrency as an asset class fits perfectly into the Millennial lifestyle. For anyone still wondering why Millennials would invest in cryptocurrencies, here are some excellent reasons:





● High and quick returns (Millennials are considered one of the most ambitious generations, historically speaking. They seek investments that benefit them with high returns in a shorter duration. While there are not many assets that generate high returns quickly, cryptocurrency can be an exception.)

● A bonus to a decent retirement portfolio

Concerning the last point, it's even more severe. Unlike their parents (depending on the country they live in), most Millennials in Latin America, for instance, are a generation without access to a future pension assured by the state. Even those who hold good jobs now are not likely to receive a pension once retirement starts. This urge to take matters into one's own hands, making long-term investments, is driven by the possibility of reaching independence and financial freedom.

Cryptocurrency is highly volatile. The fact that sometimes its 30-day gains or losses can exceed 100% is a testament to that. Meaning, the risk and returns are relatively high. However, if played out wisely, they can make a great addition to a Millennial's retirement portfolio. In that sense, the statistics already show how Gen Y demographics often seek other incomes than just what their official jobs generate. That's why it is imperative to consider which platform gives the best conditions and security to avoid precarious situations. A service that can help them generate even more additional income on which they can rely.





Also, studies have shown that the pandemic has increased the risk appetite among Millennials significantly. Here is a paradox: They remain a relatively young generation that is not very worried about liabilities since, on the one hand, they don't have a whole lot to lose and starting over does not seem like that much of a tragedy. On the other hand, they`re used to sudden changes and have come to deal with these in a surprisingly determined and organised manner.

A suitable Alternative Investment

The term 'Alternative Investment' means performance is unrelated to traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds. Cryptocurrency can make for an alternative investment for Millennials over the long term since they are likely to remain strong and pull through any financial crisis that may occur in the future—particularly if the fundamentals, use case, partnerships, and innovation of the blockchain project hold up.

So, how to invest safely? The first step is finding a reliable and trustworthy exchange for cryptocurrencies. Simplicity, security, and accessibility are three aspects that everyone should consider while choosing an exchange to invest in crypto. Before ever trying to buy any asset with your hard-earned money, make sure the platform is legit.

Many lost orientation and perspective due to the great crashes in the crypto market, like back in March 2020, or more recently, in May 2021. When the typical Elon Musk tweet hits home and provokes severe market fluctuations, some of the best platforms should be able and willing to give guidance and adapt to their customers' needs.

2021-09-09,ABC,Regulators threaten to sue cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase; $30 billion wiped off the ASX,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-09/asx-wallstreeet-currencies-commodities/100445648,"Digital currency trading firm Coinbase will be sued by the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, if the company goes ahead with plans for a cryptocurrency lending scheme.

Key points: Coinbase is threatened with legal action by the SEC over its new loan product

Coinbase is threatened with legal action by the SEC over its new loan product The Dow Jones index has dropped 0.2pc, to 35,031, the S&P 500 has fallen 0.13pc, to 4,514, and the Nasdaq has lost 0.6pc, to 15,286

The Dow Jones index has dropped 0.2pc, to 35,031, the S&P 500 has fallen 0.13pc, to 4,514, and the Nasdaq has lost 0.6pc, to 15,286 Meanwhile, ASX SPI 200 index has fallen 0.5pc, to 7,478, while the Australian dollar lost ground, to 73.65 US cents

The lending program would allow users to earn interest by lending digital money, but the SEC has classified the product as an investment security.

Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, said the SEC told the company last week that it intended to legally charge Coinbase, so the firm planned to delay the launch of its ""Lend"" product until at least October.

The company's chief executive officer, Brian Armstrong, took to Twitter to slam the agency's handling of the firm's plans to roll out the product and said the agency had denied him a meeting.

An SEC official told Reuters that the agency had held discussions with Coinbase.

Both its chief executive officer and its chief legal officer said that Coinbase disputed the SEC's determination.

""'Lend' is not an investment contract or note,"" they said.

The executive's remarks provide a glimpse into the rising tension between the cryptocurrency industry and regulators.

SEC chairman Gary Gensler has described the industry as a ""Wild West"", riddled with fraud and investor risk.

Mr Gensler has said some digital assets and platforms were operating as, or offering, securities, bringing them under the SEC's oversight.

Coinbase shares fell 3.2 per cent, to $US258.20.

Bitcoin rose 0.3 per cent, to $46,270 per digital coin.

Australian stocks take a hit

Meanwhile, the local share market tumbled after a fall overnight on Wall Street, with weaker mining stocks after the iron ore price fell, and a number of companies traded ex-dividend.

At 12:50pm AEST, the All Ordinaries lost 1.5 per cent of its value to 7,693.

Chief investment officer at Burman Invest, Julia Lee, said the losses on the All Ordinaries index amounted to around $30 billion at lunchtime. However, Ms Lee noted that stock markets were trading near record highs and were due for a correction, which is when a stock market falls at least 10 per cent from its peak.

""The concern is that Delta is eating into economic growth,"" she said.

Big miners and industrial stocks weighed on the market after the price of iron ore fell more than 4 per cent overnight to $US130.70 a tonne.

Rio Tinto lost 2.3per cent, BHP fell 1.5 per cent and Fortescue Metals declined by 0.3 per cent by 12:40pm AEST.

""It's those miners that are doing a lot of the damage today,"" Ms Lee said.

""And that's on concerns that iron ore prices will keep on falling and that's as Beijing clamps down on steel production for environmental reasons ahead of the Winter Olympics in February next year.""

At 12:50pm AEST, just 13 stocks were higher on the ASX 200, three were steady and 184 were making losses.

The benchmark index was down 1.5 per cent to 7,399 at 12:50pm AEST with all industry sectors in the red.

Leading the falls on the ASX 200 were litigation funder Omni Bridgeway (-5.9pc), financial firm Virgin Money (-6.9pc) and lithium miner Orocobre (-5.2pc).

Going up were medical device firm Resmed (+2.3pc), miner Whitehaven Coal (+2.4pc) and gold miner Gold Road Resources (+1pc).

The Australian dollar dropped 0.1 per cent to around 73.59 US cents at 12:50pm AEST.

NAB says Delta taking its toll

The National Australia Bank said there has been a huge reduction in borrowers deferring repayments on their loans since last year's COVID-19 shutdowns because the current lockdowns had been less financially damaging.

Ross McEwan has told a parliamentary committee that, at the end of August, around $1.8 billion worth of loans were deferred, compared to $58 billion at the height of the pandemic last year.

""Our position remains that a good business before COVID will most likely be a good business going forward,"" Mr McEwan said.

However, he said, the number of customers in financial hardship had risen since the outbreak of the Delta variant of the virus.

""Many businesses are in a state of hibernation, waiting for restrictions to open up and ready to get going again,"" he said.

""For others — in particular, small business customers in Sydney and Melbourne CBDs — the situation is more fragile.""

Mr McEwan also said that Australia needed its own national vaccine pass — as in European countries — that was ready to launch when 80 per cent of the population is double-vaccinated.

""Current forecasts show 80 per cent of eligible Australians will have had their first jab within three weeks, and their second jab by mid-November,"" Mr McEwan said.

""This is our light at the end of the tunnel. Our communities need hope. Our businesses need clarity, to plan for the future.""

NAB shares were down 1.5 per cent to $28.42 at 12:50pm AEST.

Commodities mixed

ANZ economists said crude oil prices gained overnight as supply issues plague the market, with US production struggling to recover from Hurricane Ida.

The US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said more than three-quarters of production remained shut in the Gulf of Mexico.

Brent crude slipped back in morning trade, to $US72.51 a barrel, while spot gold was weighed down by the stronger US dollar.

It traded around $US1789.53 an ounce as it steadied in Asian trade.

US stocks taper

Trade on Wall Street pulled back as investors worried about rising COVID-19 cases around the world as well as the timing of the US Federal Reserve's plan to ease back on its pandemic stimulus.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.20 per cent, to 35,031, the S&P 500 dropped 0.13 per cent, to 4,514, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.6 per cent, to 15,286.

Six of the 11 S&P 500 sector indices fell, with materials and energy the deepest decliners, down more than 1 per cent each.

Apple (-1pc) and Facebook (-1.2pc) fell after helping push the Nasdaq index to record highs in the previous session.

Digital currency platform Coinbase dropped after the corporate regulator the Securities Exchange Commission threatened to sue it.

Payments firm Paypal fell after buying a Japanese buy now, pay later company.

The dips in those two Silicon Valley giants contributed more than any other companies to the S&P 500's decline for the session.

Investors have become more cautious after Friday's weak August payrolls data, while pressures from rising costs, despite the economy slowing, have increased concerns that the Fed could move sooner than expected to scale back massive monetary measures enacted last year to shield the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.

In its latest Beige Book report, the Federal Reserve said the North American economy had ""downshifted slightly"" in August as concerns grew over how the renewed surge of COVID-19 cases would affect the economy's recovery.

Chief investment strategist at CFRA Sam Stovall said shareholders were hedging their bets.

""Investors are pulling petals from a daisy, saying, 'The economy will grow, the economy won't grow'.""

""They can't make up their minds, so they have not committed to long-term positions.""

St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president James Bullard told the Financial Times that the Fed should move forward with a plan to trim its pandemic stimulus program despite a slowdown in job growth.

European markets weaker

Across the Atlantic, European shares fell on jitters that the European Central Bank will start to roll back its pandemic stimulus.

The FTSE 100 index lost 0.8 per cent, to 7,096 , the DAX in Germany fell 1.5 per cent, to 15,610, while the CAC 40 in Paris 6,669, down 0.9 per cent.

The ASX SPI 200 index has fallen 0.5pc, to 7,478, while the Australian dollar lost ground to 73.65 US cents.

2021-09-09,Benzinga,Will Dogecoin Bite The Hand That Feeds It Or Follow Ethereum Into A Reversal?,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/09/22854321/will-dogecoin-bite-the-hand-that-feeds-it-or-follow-ethereum-into-a-reversal,"Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) was trading slightly higher Wednesday after crashing on Tuesday.

The cryptocurrency markets entered into turmoil prior to El Salvador purchasing 550 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which President Nayib Bukele implied was due to the International Monetary Fund attempting to sabotage the countries adoption of the cryptocurrency as legal tender.

While Bitcoin was trading lower still on Wednesday, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) regained some of its losses and Dogecoin looked to be following suit.

See Also: How to Buy Dogecoin

The Dogecoin Chart: On Tuesday Dogecoin printed a bullish hammer candlestick with a low lower wick, which indicated a reversal back to the upside. On Wednesday the crypto looked to be printing either a second hammer candlestick, if Dogecoin closes the day above the 26-cent mark, or a long-legged doji candle, if it closes near $0.256. A hammer candle would be bullish going forward while a long-legged doji would be neutral.

Wednesday’s candle was also completely within the trading range of Tuesday’s price action. An inside bar signals consolidation and can precede a larger move higher or lower. For technical traders, when a stock or crypto prints an inside bar in an uptrend, a move higher is most likely while when the pattern is created in a downtrend the opposite is anticipated.

Dogecoin tested support at the 23-cent level and bounced upwards indicating bulls bought the dip. 23 cents is a key level because Dogecoin has tested the level multiple times in the past and it has acted as both support and resistance. Dogecoin has not crossed below 23 cents since Aug. 7.

Dogecoin is trading below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) and the retracement on Tuesday caused the eight-day EMA to cross below the 21-day, both of which are bullish for the short term. Dogecoin is trading above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), however, which indicates overall sentiment in the crypto is bullish.","('https://cdn2.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/dogecoin_3_9.jpeg?width=720',)",none
2021-09-09,Daily Voice,Suffolk County IT Supervisor Accused Of Using County Resources To Mine Cryptocurrency,https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/suffolk/news/suffolk-county-it-supervisor-accused-of-using-county-resources-to-mine-cryptocurrency/815963/,"An information technology supervisor was arrested and accused of running a cryptocurrency mining operation out of Suffolk County offices, costing the county thousands of dollars in electricity.

Christopher Naples, age 42, of Mattituck, was arraigned on multiple felony charges Wednesday, Sept. 8, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Timothy Sini.

Sini said Naples was charged with the following:

Public corruption

Third-degree grand larceny

Computer trespass

Official misconduct

“Mining cryptocurrency requires an enormous amount of resources, and miners have to navigate how to cover all of those electricity and cooling costs,” Sini said. “This defendant found a way to do it; unfortunately, it was on the backs of taxpayers. We will not allow County employees, who are already on the public’s payroll, to steal taxpayer money or illegally use government resources for their own personal gain.”

Sini said Naples has worked for the county since 2000.

Investigators found that Naples had been using county resources to run a mining operation for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies out of the County Center in Riverhead since February, the DA's Office reported.

Investigators seized 46 cryptocurrency mining devices while executing a search warrant at the County Center on Thursday, Aug. 19.

The DA's Office said at least 10 of the machines had been running since February, costing the county more than $6,000. Investigation into the operation and costs of the other devices is ongoing, Sini said.

Authorities are still investigating the amount and nature of proceeds Naples may have obtained from the operation, the DA's Office said.

Naples is due to appear in court again on Thursday, Sept. 16.

Bitcoin dropped in price from above $52,000 (£37,744) to below $43,000 on Tuesday following problems with its adoption as legal tender in El Salvador. It recovered to around $46,000 but was still well down on the previous day’s peak.

Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market value, also fell by as much as 5 per cent before rebounding early yesterday to $3,390, a two-day fall of about 14 per cent, Bloomberg data showed.

Since El Salvador declared bitcoin, the gold standard of cryptocurrencies, to be its legal tender, businesses are now required to accept it in exchange for goods and services. The government has purchased $20m of bitcoin and installed 200 bitcoin machines in the country.

“Rather than having a positive impact on markets, investors were on a selling spree, despite bitcoin reaching its highest price since May, surpassing $52,000,” said Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at Avatrade.

Problems arose after some companies in El Salvador were unable to accept the cryptocurrency as legal tender, while some websites crashed as they tried to keep up with new registrations of bitcoin.

Matt Blom, head of sales trading at Eqonex, said: “The people of El Salvador are now carrying the flag for crypto. Utilising a digital currency as a means to transact outside the banking system for daily activities is a watershed moment.”","('https://i.inews.co.uk/content/uploads/2021/09/PRI_198613167.jpg',)",none
2021-09-09,Newsday,Sini: Suffolk county worker charged with running illegal cryptocurrency mining operation,https://www.newsday.com/long-island/crime/cryptocurrency-long-island-suffolk-sini-1.50355683,"A veteran Suffolk County information technology supervisor was arrested Wednesday and charged with allegedly running a cryptocurrency mining operation out of the county clerk’s Riverhead office, prosecutors said.

The covert Bitcoin mining, which went undetected for several months, cost county taxpayers at least $6,000 in electricity and put important county infrastructure at risk, Suffolk County District Attorney Timothy Sini said.

""We will not tolerate county employees, who are already on the public payroll, to steal taxpayer money and illegally use government resources for their own personal gain,"" Sini said at a news conference Wednesday.

Christopher Naples, 42, of Mattituck, turned himself in to authorities Wednesday morning and was charged with third-degree grand larceny, public corruption, computer trespassing and official misconduct. Naples pleaded not guilty and was released without bail at his arraignment.

Naples, who has worked for Suffolk County government since 2000, is the assistant manager of Information Technology Operations in the county clerk’s office. Naples’ current employment status was unclear.

Suffolk County Clerk Judith A. Pascale, in a written statement Wednesday, said her office was ""fully assisting"" the DA's investigation.

""The public can be assured that no Suffolk County records were accessed, misused or impacted by the conduct being investigated by the District Attorney’s Office,"" Pascale said.

Naples’ attorney did not respond to a message seeking comment.

The district attorney's office began investigating after receiving a tip to its Public Integrity Bureau and installed surveillance cameras in the hallways of the building housing the clerk's office in the 300 block of Center Drive in Riverhead.

Sini said authorities executed search warrants on Aug. 19 and found 46 cryptocurrency mining devices, which require high levels of electricity to run, hidden in six different rooms — including under removable floorboards and inside an unused electrical wall panel. Authorities believe Naples had been operating at least 10 of the machines since February.

Sini said Naples admitted to owning and installing the devices when confronted by investigators.

Bitcoin, a digital store of value that operates without a central bank or overseer, are ""mined"" by high-powered computers and the transactions are recorded in a ledger known as blockchain. Mining is legal and can be lucrative. Sini said investigators are still trying to determine the dollar amount of Naples' mining proceeds.

Before Naples' alleged mining was uncovered, county employees working in the building housing the clerk's office had complained about the air conditioning and slow internet connections, which Sini attributed to the strain on the building's energy resources due to the mining.

Sini said when investigators entered a room where the bitcoin mining was occurring, which also housed secure data storage systems and communications equipment for county government, an alarm indicated the temperature was too high.

""Within hours of the devices being shut down, the temperature in the room dropped 20 degrees,"" Sini said. ""So not only was this operation being paid for with thousands of dollars of taxpayer money, but it also put the County’s infrastructure at risk. The defendant also had to bypass the County’s internet security protocols in order to get these devices online, which could have potentially jeopardized the security of the County’s network.""","('https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.50355684.1631151330!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpg',)",none

2021-09-09,CityNews Toronto,Toronto police warn of cryptocurrency phishing scam,https://toronto.citynews.ca/2021/09/08/toronto-police-warn-of-cryptocurrency-phishing-scam/,"Toronto police are warning cryptocurrency investors of an ongoing phishing scam that has defrauded victims out of several thousands.

Police explain that the fraudsters are using fake sites to carry out the scam when people who have their cryptocurrency stored on an online platform use a search engine to find the site and log in.

The search results usually show multiple sites and the top hit may be a sponsored advertisement for a site that looks legitimate, but in reality mirrors the actual cryptocurrency exchange page.

The mirrored page is designed to capture the user’s login details and once the account details are entered, they cannot actually log in.

While trying to recover the account, the user may enter the answers to their private account recovery questions. All this information is then used to transfer the user’s cryptocurrency to the scammer’s accounts.

One of the victims of such a scam tells CityNews he is well versed in cryptocurrency and has been investing in it for over five years, believing that he knew the risks and how information could be compromised well enough not to fall for a scam.

Rick (name changed for privacy) says he lost over $300,000 in Ethereum on July 13, when he accidentally logged in to a mirror site, instead of the real one.

When he logged into his “wallet,” he received a notification for a normal firmware update which asked him for his password to proceed.

He says the currency was gone in an instant and the scammers sent the currency from his account to another one and eventually moved it to 12 other accounts, making it extremely difficult to track down.

According to Rick, the only trail left that may help in finding the funds are what’s known as “address codes” and upon following them, he discovered they’re linked to accounts in Eastern Europe.

While he did report the incident to police, he believe the search engines should be liable as it is possible to pay to have certain sites show up as top searches on them.

Police is warning people to be extra cautious when it comes to protecting their investments in cryptocurrency.

“As cryptocurrency is decentralized and not regulated, it can be extremely challenging to recover these assets,” they said in a release.","('https://toronto.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/10/2019/03/CPT110535878.jpg',)",none

The price has since recovered to just over $46,700 as of 11.30am EST.

The next way to look at all of this, which isn’t about differing opinions about what is or isn’t a security, but an unwillingness on the part of the SEC, the body with the authority to make that argument to actually make the argument. Going back to Simon Taylor’s reframing of this as bond buying, the problem is that the SEC isn’t saying to Coinbase “we actually see this as bond buying” or any other reframing for that matter. They’re just saying, “nope, it’s a security because we say so.” Mark Cuban responded to Brian Armstrong’s thread saying, “Brian, this is regulation via litigation.

You have to go on the offensive.” Investor Adam Cochran agrees, saying: “Part of me wonders if the SEC’s unwillingness to provide Coinbase guidance on why they’re blocking their lead program is because they can’t. Like, maybe they realized that things they think are a security may not all be accounted for in the act from 1933. They don’t like it. They have concerns it feels to them as if it should be a security. But under the Howey Test and Exchange Act, they know it wouldn’t really stand up in a court and they don’t want to set a precedent that would make this industry harder on them.” Chainlink God put it more poetically: “So the SEC is pushing people through a minefield without telling anyone where their mines are and yet at the same time telling them to not step on any mines or you’ll die. This makes zero logical sense.”","('https://www.coindesk.com/pf/resources/images/social/dark/facebook.png?d=86',)",none
2021-09-09,The Daily Hodl,"Ethereum, Cardano, and Algorand Will Rise Due to ‘Great Use Cases’: SkyBridge Capital Chief Anthony Scaramucci",https://dailyhodl.com/2021/09/08/ethereum-cardano-and-algorand-will-rise-due-to-great-use-cases-skybridge-capital-chief-anthony-scaramucci/,"SkyBridge Capital founder and co-managing partner Anthony Scaramucci says altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Algorand (ALGO) will likely continue to grow because of their clear utility.

In a new interview on CNBC, the investment veteran says that despite the sharp correction that crypto markets experienced on the same day that El Salvador officially adopted BTC as legal tender, he still sees an overall bullish macro picture for the digital asset space.

“It felt like it was peaking as a result of the El Salvador news, there was a lot of leverage in the system, and a lot of leverage blew out… over the last 48 hours. Having said that, the demand and the fundamentals for things like Bitcoin continue to improve. Every day you hear new stories about more wallets, more activity, more potentiality of an ETF (exchange-traded fund) – at least a Bitcoin futures ETF – and so I’m still quite optimistic for year-end…”

Beyond Bitcoin, Scaramucci also names Ethereum, Cardano, and payments-focused blockchain Algorand as coins he expects to rise based on what he sees as “great use cases.”

“There’s a lot of great stuff happening in this space… As more digital applications happen, some of those altcoins, stuff like Algorand or Cardano, or things like Ethereum, will continue to rise because there’s actually great use cases for them.”

Earlier in the year, Scaramucci said that while he’s mostly focused on Bitcoin, he still thought Ethereum could be on its way to becoming a “store-of-value” asset.

“I think there’s a very big market for Ethereum and I predict that Ethereum has good fundamentals and will grow, but I’m in an institutionalist sort of business. I think like an institutionalist, and I’ve got to get my clients thinking about cryptocurrency and digital assets. So as a first step, I’m focused on Bitcoin and we only have now a Bitcoin fund…

Could we have an Ethereum fund in the future? Yes, we certainly could. Everything that you’re saying is true with the non-fungible tokens, and the technology around Ethereum is going to make it a sticky cryptocurrency and a store of value and something that people will transact with.”

2021-09-09,,Cryptocurrency In Uzbekistan: Legal Or Not?,https://www.mondaq.com/fin-tech/1109612/cryptocurrency-in-uzbekistan-legal-or-not,"ARTICLE

To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.

IS IT LEGAL TO ENGAGE IN CRYPTOCURRENCY AND HOW TO CREATE A CRYPTO EXCHANGE IN UZBEKISTAN

The capital that rotates in the cryptocurrency is estimated at billions of dollars. Each country has separate legal base that make it unprofitable to invest in cryptocurrencies. Uzbekistan was not an exception. However, the country has changed its opinion in the long run. Recently several acts have been signed in order to support the development of cryptocurrency activities.

To create a framework and regulate this rapidly developing sphere, the President of Uzbekistan has signed the Decree of the President No. 3832 ""On measures for the development of the digital economy in the Republic of Uzbekistan"" dated 03.07.2018.

The Decree outlined the most important tasks:

introduction and development of activities in the field of crypto-asset turnover, including mining (activities to maintain a distribution platform and create new blocks with the ability to receive remuneration in the format of new units and commission fees in various cryptocurrencies), smart contracts (an electronic contract, the fulfillment of rights and obligations under which is carried out by performing digital transactions automatically), consulting, issue, exchange, storage, distribution, management, insurance, crowd-funding (collective financing), as well as blockchain technologies for the diversification of various forms of investment and entrepreneurial activity;

creation of the necessary legal framework for the introduction of blockchain technologies, taking into account the best practices of foreign countries.

Important mechanisms to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions have also been identified as:

Transactions of legal entities and individuals related to the turnover of crypto assets, including those carried out by non-residents, are not subject to taxation, and the income received from these transactions is not included in the tax base for taxes and other mandatory payments;

Currency transactions related to the turnover of crypto-assets conducted by persons who have received a license to carry out activities in the field of turnover of crypto assets by the established procedure are not subject to the norms of the legislation on currency regulation.

After that, the Decree No.3832, the Decree No.3926 ""On the organisation of the activities of crypto-exchanges"" dated 02.09.2018 was later signed.

The Decree defined the main directions:

a crypto exchange is an organisation that provides an electronic platform for the exchange, purchase, and sale of crypto assets;

a crypto asset is a set of records in the blockchain that has a value and an owner;

the activities related to the turnover of crypto-assets and crypto exchanges are not subject to the legislation on securities and exchange activities;

a license to operate crypto-exchanges is issued exclusively to foreign legal entities by opening subsidiaries or other enterprises on the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan;

for the implementation of industrial mining (the use of more than 100 kW/h), land plots are provided without an electronic auction.

The activities carried out by the crypto exchange are subject to licensing.

To obtain a license, it is necessary:

a) to have a formed authorised fund in the amount of at least 30,000 basic calculated amount in the form of funds as of the date of application submission (about 761,000 USD), of which 12,000 (about 305,000 USD) are reserved in a separate account with a commercial bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan;

b) the presence of a functioning electronic system of crypto-exchange trading hosted on servers located on the territory of Uzbekistan, and meets the requirements provided for in the Regulation on the procedure for licensing the activities of crypto-exchanges;

c) the existence of rules for crypto-exchange trading, which must necessarily reflect:

the procedure for admission to crypto-exchange trading of participants;

measures aimed at ensuring compliance with the requirements of the legislation on countering the legalization of proceeds from criminal activities, the financing of terrorism, and the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction;

procedures for admission to circulation and exclusion from the circulation of crypto assets;

procedure for the implementation and registration of transactions with crypto assets;

the procedure for mutual settlements of participants in crypto-exchange trading when concluding transactions;

the amount of the fee for using the services of the crypto exchange and the procedure for determining it;

measures to prevent price manipulation on the crypto exchange and the misuse of confidential information;

prohibition on the use of crypto assets for illegal purposes;

d) the implementation of quotations for crypto assets based on the ratio of supply and demand for them;

e) storage for 5 years of information about transactions with clients' crypto assets, as well as their identification data and materials on customer relations, including business correspondence.

Crypto-exchanges were granted the right to:

receive remuneration for the services provided, including crypto assets, set its amount and the procedure for charging trading participants (clients);

organise exchange transactions with residents and non-residents of the Republic of Uzbekistan aimed at the acquisition and (or) alienation of crypto assets for national and foreign currency, as well as the exchange of crypto assets for other crypto assets.

The turnover of crypto assets and tokens was regulated with the adoption of Order No.16 of the Director of the National Agency for Project Management dated 21.01.2019, No. 3127, which approved the Regulation on the procedure for licensing the activities of crypto exchanges and the rules for conducting crypto-exchange trading.

The rules for the implementation of crypto-exchange trading gave definitions to the main concepts used in crypto-exchange trading:

blockchain is a distributed data registry in which all data is written sequentially and distributed in blocks, while each new block is connected to the previous block by a cryptographic signature;

a crypto asset is a set of records in the blockchain that has a value and an owner;

a crypto exchange is an organization that provides an electronic platform for the exchange, purchase, and sale of crypto assets and tokens;

a token is a unit of accounting designed to represent a digital balance sheet, performing the function of a ""substitute for securities"" in the digital world, representing an entry in the register distributed in the blockchain. The token is issued by a legal entity or an individual entrepreneur (issuer) to attract investment and financing to the activity;

a stablecoin is a crypto asset whose value is tied to the asset of a legal entity.

Under the Rules of crypto-exchange trading, residents of Uzbekistan cannot buy digital currency. They are only allowed to sell crypto assets and tokens. This restriction does not apply to citizens of other countries. They have the right to buy and sell crypto assets, subject to their mandatory identification and the conclusion of official contracts with them.

Any anonymous transactions with cryptocurrency are prohibited in Uzbekistan. Also, crypto-assets cannot be used as a means of payment on the territory of Uzbekistan. The authorised body regulating transactions with cryptocurrency is the National Agency for Project Management under the President of Uzbekistan (NAPU).

2021-09-09,The Daily Hodl,"Price of Ethereum To Grow Over 900%, According to Financial Giant Standard Chartered – Here’s Why",https://dailyhodl.com/2021/09/08/price-of-ethereum-to-grow-over-900-according-to-financial-giant-standard-chartered-heres-why/,"Financial services giant Standard Chartered has revealed a staggering estimate of Ethereum’s potential valuation.

In a new report titled “Ethereum Investor Guide,” the $781 billion firm prices Ethereum (ETH) somewhere between $26,000 and $35,000 per token, which is more than 900% above its current level.

ADVERTISEMENT

“A range of USD 26,000-35,000 may appear high compared to the current ETH price (just below USD 4,000), but we think the current price reflects both the relative complexity of ETH (versus BTC), and the uncertainty around ETH’s development. In other words, while potential returns may be greater than for BTC, risks are also higher.”

The British banking behemoth also indicates the need for Bitcoin to perform well as a key condition for Ethereum to reach its predicted valuation.

“For this valuation range to be attainable, we assume that BTC would also need to trade towards the upper end of its valuation range (which we estimate at USD 175,000). If the dominant crypto asset (BTC) trades well, we think this will benefit investor perceptions of other crypto assets.”

Standard Chartered says that to evaluate Bitcoin, they compare the total transaction values of all credit card companies to the market cap of BTC, assuming that the leading digital asset “becomes to crypto what cash is to global finance.” The firm then uses a similar method to calculate their Ethereum valuation.

“Extending this analogy to Ethereum, ETH is the global banking system for crypto – i.e, it is the infrastructure that enables dApps/DeFi, in the same way that the banking system enables non-linear finance involving complex transactions.”

Last week, macro guru and former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal said Ethereum trading north of $20,000 felt like a reasonable valuation.

“My price prediction has been ETH north of $20,000, and that’s pretty simple. All I did is just map over the ETH chart to the Bitcoin 2017 chart. They work perfectly, and it gives you $20,000. There’s no great science to that, but it feels about right.”

The ratings service posted a trio of jobs this week: Crypto-asset analyst, crypto-asset framework designer and senior blockchain platform engineer, all of which point to the increasing impact of cryptocurrency and NFTs on global financial markets.

The company also appears to be taking decentralized finance particularly seriously, noting that candidates for the crypto-asset analyst position should be well-versed on the “potential wide-reaching impact of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on existing ecosystem.”

The framework designer would join Moody’s existing blockchain analytics team, according to the job posting. The job’s responsibilities include research and development of projects surrounding everything from stablecoins to NFTs to DAOs — indicating Moodys is hoping to analyze a wide spectrum of the crypto universe.

The blockchain engineer, meanwhile, would be involved in developing applications for Moody’s internal use of blockchain technology. The job posting indicates that it could involve the deployment of smart contracts, NFTs and blockchain oracles.

Moody’s did not immediately return a request for comment.

The ratings agency most recently made crypto headlines when they downgraded El Salvador’s rating in July, in part due to the law that passed making Bitcoin legal tender in the country. Bitcoin tumbled more than $10,000 briefly as that law went into effect this week.

2021-09-08,Markets Insider,"Bitcoin will double to $100,000 by early next year - and ether could hit as much as $35,000 in the long run, Standard Chartered says",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-ether-crypto-price-outlook-standard-chartered-100000-early-2022-2021-9,"OZAN KOSE/AFP via Getty Images

Bitcoin will hit as much as $100,000 by early 2022, Standard Chartered predicted on Tuesday.

Ether could hit as much as $35,000, but bitcoin would have to reach $175,000 to attain that level, the team said.

""While potential returns may be greater for ETH than for BTC, risks are also higher,"" they added.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Bitcoin will surge 115% from current levels to $100,000 either late this year or early next year, and could reach $175,000 in the long term, Standard Chartered's cryptocurrency research team has forecast.

The bank's team said it ""structurally"" values bitcoin between the range of $50,000 to $175,000. ""Cyclically, we expect a peak around $100,000 in late 2021 or early 2022,"" they said in a note Tuesday.

It also sees the current price of ethereum's native token rising tenfold to between $26,000 to $35,000. No time period was specified for the price target.

That range ""may appear high compared to the current ETH price, but we think the current price reflects both the relative complexity of ETH (versus BTC) and the uncertainty around ETH's development,"" StanChart's Geoff Kendrick, Christopher Graham, and Melissa Chan said in the note.

""In other words, while potential returns may be greater for ETH than for BTC, risks are also higher,"" they added.

For ether to hit that range, bitcoin would need to trade towards the upper end of its valuation range at $175,000, the StanChart team said.

Bitcoin was last trading around $46,160 on Wednesday, regaining some ground after Tuesday's sell-off that came alongside El Salvador's bumpy rollout of the cryptocurrency as legal tender. Ether consolidated losses at $3,387, according to data from CoinDesk.

""As a medium of exchange, BTC may become the dominant peer-to-peer payment method for the global unbanked in a future cashless world,"" the StanChart team said.

The ethereum network, which underwent a major upgrade last month, offers smart contracts that promise to cut out middlemen in financial services. But other networks, such as cardano, are developing the capacity for smart contracts, which automatically execute a specified process once defined rules are met.

The Asia-focused bank's team said they used credit-card company transactions and market valuations as a reference point for their analysis.

Using a ""financial market versus currency"" analogy, they looked at credit-card providers' market capitalization versus potential transactions in the unbanked sector to arrive at their bitcoin price valuation. For ether, they said they compared the value of global banks against the value of global credit-card companies.

""Rather than being akin to a currency like bitcoin, (ethereum) is more akin to a financial market in which non-linear financial transactions such as lending, insurance and exchanges can operate,"" they said.

Toronto police are out with a warning about fraudulent websites designed to steal your account number and password.

They say some people are using websites like Google to search for legitimate trading platforms, but end up clicking the wrong link.

Investigators say the top hit on search engines may actually be a sponsored advertisement that is set up to mirror the log-in page of real websites.

If you enter your login information on this scam website, you won’t be able to access your account.

Sometimes, the website will also ask you to answer account recovery questions.

Any info you enter on this site is sent to scammers, who’ll be able to log in to your account and even use security questions to keep control following a password change.

This is a type of scam known as ‘phishing.’

Police say it is very difficult to recover lost cryptocurrency, so you should take every precaution to secure your assets.

Instead of searching for the site you want to use, try writing down the web address or bookmarking the real login page.

Bitcoin , the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, crashed as much as 14 per cent from its recent highs before recovery part of those losses to trade 8 per cent lower.The crash in the cryptocurrency market came just as El Salvador became the first country in the world to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, despite widespread domestic skepticism and international warnings of risks for consumers. According to experts, the market was expecting the fall anytime soon after the recent rally. Cynicism over glitched rollout in El Salvador might just be an excuse.""This volatility and profit taking was expected after a strong bull run from the lows, but the magnitude is very much violent,"" said Ishan Arora, Partner, Tykhe Block Ventures. ""Not many altcoins could hold it well,"" he added.Similarly, Ethereum plunged 16 per cent during the session and was last trading 8 per cent lower at $3,400 level. Polkadot, Chainlink and XRP (Ripple) crashed the most, eroding over 26 per cent of investors' wealth in just 24 hours.Cardano, Binance Coin Uniswap and Litcoin were the other top tokens which shed between 15-20 per cent during the day, but most had recovered much of their losses likely due to bargain buying by investors. Among the pack of top 100 tokens, Theta lost almost one third or 32 per cent of its value.According to the data from coinmarketcap.com , the traded volume of the crypto market in the last 24 hours has gained over 67 per cent to $241.64 billion. This is about 12 per cent of the total global crypto market cap, which is just about $2 trillion mark.""We don’t see any fundamental reasons tied up with this drop, but one possible reason could be the mass liquidation of Bitcoin longs which resulted in a massive drop within a few minutes,"" said Hitesh Malviya, founder, itsblockchain.com The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has threatened to sue Coinbase Global Inc if the crypto exchange goes ahead with its plans to launch a programme allowing users to earn interest by lending crypto assets.After this bloodbath in the crypto market, investors are on their feet as they are anticipating a déjà vu, just like May this year. However, market experts have a different opinion on this.Arora from Tykhe Block Ventures said that he expects Bitcoin to hold $40,000 level, which is likely to cap the downfall. ""Altcoins may bounce back much stronger when Bitcoin recovers as they have shown good strength.""On the other hand, Malviya has a different opinion and he did not rule out the possibility of Bitcoin retesting its recent lows at $30,000.""The chances for such a bearish scenario are minimal, but not out of the question,"" he said. ""However, Bitcoin will stay in the bull market as long the price stays above $43,000 on the daily timeframe,"" he added.Despite mixed opinions, market experts are suggesting investors to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at lower valuations. ""This is a good buy-the-dip opportunity and should not be missed,"" said Arora.However, one should not hurry and invest the entire capital at one go. ""Bitcoin is a steal below $40,000 for a long-term position and one should not miss the bus this time,"" Malviya said.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-86033374,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-303314,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-09-08,CNN,"Yes, the IRS can tax bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. What you need to know",https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/08/success/cryptocurrency-taxation-feseries/index.html,"El Salvador's adoption of bitcoin as legal tender may have been a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies. But in the United States, even though you can use crypto to buy and sell products or services, don't think for a minute that makes it just like cash -- at least not if you want to avoid trouble with the IRS.

Virtualcurrencies are taxed as property, or as an investment , when you sellthem. To make matters more confusing, using them to buy something technically counts as selling.

If you're paid in bitcoin or other crypto, on the other hand, that will be treated as taxable income to you.

Indeed, almost every transaction may be taxable and should be reported.

While bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be virtual, they havevery real-world tax consequences. If you fail to pay the tax you owe, you will be subject to interest and penalties and, in some circumstances, even criminal prosecution.

So if you couldn't resist getting in on, say, bitcoin's wild ride -- it rose 437% in just the past year, at one point trading north of $60,000 in April and dropping below $43,000 this week - keep good records, because you are responsible for preserving documentation for every one of your transactions.

Do crypto transactions get reported to the IRS?

There is no legally required third-party reporting of crypto trades or many types of crypto payments. But that may soon change if the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is enacted. If it is enacted, then exchanges like Coinbase would have to report your trades. The bill has passed the Senate and awaits a vote in the House this month.

In the meantime -- and especially if the bill doesn't get enacted -- there are a variety of ways the IRS will assess whether you have engaged in taxable crypto transactions.

For instance, any business paying more than $600 to a non-employee or paying wages to an employee must report that income to the IRS, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting.

Plus, every federal tax filer at the top of their 1040 form must truthfully answer a question about whether they received, sold, sent, exchanged, or otherwise acquired any financial interest in any virtual currency during the tax year.

That doesn't mean the IRS will simply rely on an honor system. ""They have the perception that there are many more people engaged in virtual currency transactions than is being reported on returns,"" Luscombe said.

So, together with the US Department of Justice, the tax agency is actively seeking compliance in a few ways.

It has started a "" virtual currency compliance campaign "" that will include public outreach but also ""examinations."" That can mean audits.

In addition, the IRS sent letters in the summer of 2019 to 10,000 people alerting them to their tax obligations regarding virtual currencies and urging them to review and amend past returns if they owe back taxes, interest and penalties.

How did it get the names of those 10,000 people? ""[T]hrough various ongoing IRS compliance efforts,"" the agency noted.

One such effort: The IRS is seeking customer lists from cryptocurrency companies through legal summonses.

""The Department of Justice will continue to work with the IRS to ensure that cryptocurrency owners are paying their fair share of taxes,"" the DOJ said in a statement in April.

The IRS also has a Criminal Investigation Cyber Crimes Unit, charged with snuffing out illegal activity in virtual currency transactions.

What tax do I owe on cryptocurrency if I sell it?

You must report any capital gain or capital loss from the sale of your cryptocurrencies. That will be determined by the difference -- in US dollars -- between how much you paid when buying them and how much you received when you sold them.

If you held the investment for a year or less and it had appreciated in value by the time you sold it, your gain will be taxed as ordinary income. If you held it longer than a year, then it would be subject to capital gains tax rates.

If you lost money on the sale, you may use your capital loss to offset any capital gains you incurred in other investments, Luscombe said.

How about if I got paid in a virtual currency for a good or service?

That's reportable as ordinary income to you. And the amount of income reported should be the value in US dollars of the virtual currency the day you received it.

What if I paid someone else in virtual currency?

That's like a sale of bitcoin on which you will realize a gain or loss. The IRS notes that the gain or loss is determined by ""the difference between the fair market value of the services you received and your adjusted basis in the virtual currency exchanged.""

What should I report if all I did was buy virtual currency?

You don't have to report it on your tax return, according to the IRS , just as you wouldn't report an investment you purchased and are holding in a brokerage account, unless it threw off taxable income, such as dividends or interest.

Will my state tax my crypto transactions?

Probably, but you should see what your state revenue department has said on the issue.

""Most states have not specifically addressed virtual currency, which means that the majority of states that have an income tax would follow the federal lead,"" Luscombe said.

Any money you earn from your crypto investments or income payments will be factored into your federal adjusted gross income. And most states use your federal AGI as a starting point.

Two states -- Nevada and Wyoming, neither of which have an income tax -- did specify they would not subject virtual currency transactions to the state property tax, Luscombe said.","('https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210408121317-20210408-bitcoin-2020-tax-gfx-super-tease.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrency prices continue to be in the red on September 8. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $2.o5 trillion, a 10.25 percent decrease over the last day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $244.82 billion, which makes a 51.81 percent increase.

The volume of all stable coins is now $195.51 billion – 79.86 percent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. Bitcoin's price is currently $46,309.44 and its dominance is currently 42.32 percent, an increase of 0.30 percent over the day.

This comes after El Salvador bought its first 200 bitcoins, President Nayib Bukele said on Monday, an announcement that sent the price of the cryptocurrency rising one day before the country formally adopts it as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.

Ahead of the launch, El Salvador bought 400 bitcoins worth around $20 million, Bukele said, helping drive the price of the currency above $52,000 for the first time since May. Hours later, however, bitcoin had weakened and last traded down 10.19% at $47,222.02.

The price of Solana is technically in the red, but the coin has risen by over 450% in the past month. At 3:44pm Indian Standard Time (IST), the price of Solana was at around $164, whereas its price was in the $31-33 range just last month.

The token, which has many of the properties of Ethereum, is also seen as its primary competitor. In the past month, Solana’s rise has been attributed to growing adoption in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) markets.

In fact, while Solana’s price has dropped in the past 24 to 48 hours, Coinmarketcap shows an over 45% increase in its seven day prices.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/86038623/While-Bitcoin-bombed-heres-what-remained-in-the-green.jpg',)",none

More than ever businesses are turning to cryptocurrency to support their growth and keep up with consumer demand.

Absolute Digital Media, a digital marketing agency offering search engine optimisation (SEO), pay per click (PPC) and digital PR is the latest to join in.

As of October, the agency will be adding cryptocurrency to its list of payment methods and the team are thrilled.

Agency Founder and CEO, Ben Austin, commented:

""As of October, we at Absolute Digital Media will accept cryptocurrency as our latest payment method. This applies to all our existing clients who will be given the opportunity to pay by crypto if they want to as well as those we are currently speaking to and future business. We will first be accepting Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Cardano with the aim of expanding the currencies available in the future. We can't wait until it's official rollout!""

This comes at an exciting time for the agency, whereby it has already completed numerous in-house changes.

Since the start of the pandemic the Absolute Digital Media team have been working from home and as of January 2021, the agency became a remote-first agency.

As part of this exciting shift, the team have been provided with additional perks such as the ability to choose their working hours, the chance to continue to work remotely (at home, in a café or another remote workspace) and have now been given the opportunity to work from anywhere in Europe.

Several of Absolute Digital Media's team have already taken full advantage, relocating their remote office spaces to elsewhere around the globe. Whilst some have chosen to work from sunny Spain, others have gone back home to see their family and friends which for many has been the light at the end of the tunnel.

With Absolute Digital Media set to introduce crypto as their latest payment method and host of other businesses including Microsoft and Starbucks already accepting the likes of Bitcoin, many more are expected to follow in their footsteps.

According to Ukrinform, 276 MPs voted for the document at its second reading and in its entirety on Wednesday, September 8.

""The law regulates legal relations arising in connection with the turnover of virtual assets in Ukraine, defines the rights and obligations of participants in the virtual assets market, the principles of state policy in the field of virtual assets turnover,"" the explanatory note to the bill reads.

It states that the adopted document will allow Ukrainian blockchain companies to legalize their own business processes and officially work with the banking system. In addition, this opportunity will be granted to citizens who receive income from transactions with virtual assets.

The bill also forms the legal framework for working in the virtual assets market, determines the legal status, classification, property rights and other key legal definitions. In particular, it determines the list of professional service providers in the virtual assets market and their registration.

According to the document, the regulator of the virtual assets market will be the Ministry for Digital Transformation of Ukraine and the Committee on Digital Transformation of Ukraine, and in some cases the National Bank of Ukraine and the National Securities and Stock Market Commission. The explanatory note emphasizes that the granting of legal status to virtual assets will stimulate the development of a new industry in the legal field of the state and will help increase revenues to the state budget through taxes.

""Ukrainians will be able to tokenize property rights and will receive the judicial protection of rights to virtual assets. International cryptocurrencies will legally operate on Ukrainian territory,"" the explanatory note reads.

Bill No. 3637 ""On Virtual Assets"" was supported by parliament at its first reading last year and was finalized in accordance with amendments submitted by MPs. After that, on April 28, 2021, the Committee on Digital Transformation recommended that the Verkhovna Rada adopt this bill at its second reading.

The almost 14% dip in Bitcoin price was mirrored by cryptocurrency prices across the board – with falling values of XRP Ripple, Ethereum and Cardano contributing to a $400billion wipeout in the crypto market.

This follows a period of renewed confidence in the coin as it surged toward a much-anticipated return to a one trillion dollar cap and its $64,000 peak reached in April 2021.

Bitcoin price drops along with values of Ethereum, Cardano, XRP - is crypto crashing? (Image credit: Getty Images)

Here are the latest prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and more today as the cryptocurrency crash continues.

How much is Bitcoin worth today?

As of 8.45am, Bitcoin’s price today (8 September) was fluctuating around $45,362.73 or £32,963.05 according to CoinDesk.

While the cryptocurrency’s market cap stood at around $946.08 billion or £693.45bn on 23 August, it had fallen to $853.25bn by Wednesday morning.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin had shed $7,044.33 in the last 24 hours – down 13.44%.

On Tuesday morning at just before 4am, the coin had been trading at $52,722.34 or roughly £45,327.24.

The dramatic Bitcoin dip collided with El Salvador’s controversial acceptance of the coin as a form of legal tender – with President Nayib Bukele’s appreciation for Bitcoin being met with some confusion and protest in the country.

El Salvador’s digital wallet, Chivo, was hit with technical difficulties and pulled into downtime on Tuesday after it buckled under user demand and registrations.

Citizens of El Salvador were encouraged to sign up to the wallet and claim $30 in free BTC upon downloading, but the app proved difficult to download on Apple, Huawei and Google Play stores.

Geoff McCabe, chairman of decentralized payment ecosystem, Divi Project and member of Brock Pierce’s Delegation, who met with the El Salvadorian government to consult on the implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender, commented: “This is a seminal moment in crypto history and important that it succeeds.

""It will confirm Bitcoin’s (and crypto more generally) utility and its power to return financial and economic sovereignty to nation-states and the individual.”

Mr McCabe added: “Success in El Salvador will likely trigger a domino effect.

""People are tired of the oversized power of the US dollar and of the bullying that has gone on for decades.

""The Delegation has been contacted by 20-30 countries who want to understand more about what’s going on in El Salvador and how they can replicate it in their own country.”

When was the last major crypto crash?

In June, the Chinese Government cracked down on considerable crypto mining operations taking place in the Sichuan province and demanded that Chinese banks and payment channels stop supporting decentralised and anonymous crypto transactions.

This saw Bitcoin prices tumble to below $30,000 in a dramatic plummet from its soaring success.

The cryptocurrency has continued to rise and fall as other global administrations and regulators mull legislation to curb increased crypto activity often attributed to laundering and crime.

Following the Chinese state’s move, countries like South Korea also pledged to tackle the rise in money laundering taking place via cryptocurrency, while the Metropolitan Police announced that it had successfully closed in on a huge UK cryptocurrency money-laundering operation.

July saw the Met seize a cryptocurrency operation valued at £180million in the UK’s largest cryptocurrency seizure to date.

In turn, cryptocurrency exchange platforms such as Binance have been feeling the heat across the world as regulators and governments have started to pay close attention to the operations of such platforms in the wake of the global crackdown on crypto.

The result of this saw Bitcoin’s highest prices sliced in half in June, with the coin struggling to break out of the low to mid $30k price range until it received a welcome boost from Tesla founder Elon Musk in his appearance at major Bitcoin conference in July.

The bullish rise and increased confidence in Bitcoin will likely see it remain at prices around $50k threshold but with increased resistance as it looks ahead to regaining the $14,000 between its current price and April’s all time high.

What are the prices of Ethereum, Cardano and Ripple today?

With all coins tending to move in tandem with Bitcoin, Ethereum was trading down by more than 15% on the last 24 hours at $3,284.50 or

£2,386.08 at 9am on Wednesday (8 September).

A popular cryptocurrency synonymous with the rising crypto trend of NFTs, Ethereum has an all time high of $4,382.73 which it reached in May’s cryptocurrency boom, but it has struggled to return to this peak since.

The hype surrounding popular memecoin Dogecoin had appeared to diminish recently as new altcoins took centre stage.

Dogecoin was trading -19% on the last 24 hours at $0.241361 (£0.175340) on Wednesday morning.

Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) prices are fluctuating around $2.28 (£1.65), XRP Ripple at $1.06 (£0.767609) and Stellar at $0.313361 (£0.227646)

as of 9.15am on Wednesday.

XRP and Stellar were the main cryptocurrencies leading the latest market crash, with values of both down over 20% on the last 24 hours.

About Cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.

Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain that serves as a public financial transaction database.

The Jamestown Chamber of Commerce is set to hold a groundbreaking for Applied Blockchain Inc. on Highway 20 north of the city.

Bitcoin and ether fell further on Wednesday after plunging during El Salvador's BTC rollout on Tuesday.

Analysts said price falls on Tuesday were accelerated by high levels of leverage in crypto markets.

Glitches on exchanges such as Coinbse and Kraken also worsened the situation, analysts said.

Bitcoin and ether fell again on Wednesday before regaining some ground after plunging during El Salvador's bumpy bitcoin rollout the day before, with more than $360 billion wiped off the highly leveraged crypto market in just two days.

Bitcoin fell as much as 5% on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg data, before paring losses. It was 1% lower by 9.50 a.m. ET to trade at $46,347, after a two-day drop of 11%.

Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market value, also fell as much as 5% before rebounding somewhat. It stood 0.6% lower at $3,390 early Wednesday, with its two-day fall coming to 14%, Bloomberg data showed.

Cryptocurrencies began to crater on Tuesday as El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender in a landmark moment for the world's biggest cryptocurrency. The rollout was afflicted by glitches, with the small central American country's Chivo wallet having to be taken offline.

""Bitcoin is lower on a 'buy leading up to the big event, sell the fact' reaction to El Salvador's historic moment embracing bitcoin,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at trading platform Oanda, said.

Bobby Ong, chief executive of crypto data company CoinGecko, agreed with Moya's analysis and said the price falls were so steep due to the effects of leverage in crypto markets.

Many of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance allow users to borrow large sums to bet on the markets. Yet when prices fall, investors often have to sell out of their positions, or exchanges liquidate them automatically to limit losses.

Matt Blom, head of sales trading at Nasdaq-listed crypto firm Eqonex, said: ""Heavy selling on derivatives platforms… caused a cascade of auto-liquidations, like a line of dominoes,"" he said. ""Over $2 billion of long positions were liquidated in under 20 minutes.""

Matters weren't helped by problems on major cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini, which led to transactions being delayed or canceled.

Coinbase said its issues were caused by ""a sudden increase in network traffic and market activity"" that led to a ""degradation in our services.""

So-called altcoins such as cardano, binance coin, XRP and dogecoin were also nursing heavy losses after falling sharply on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which tracks a range of crypto tokens, was down 0.7% on Wednesday and had shed 11.5% over two days.

The total market value of all cryptocurrencies stood at $2.01 trillion on Wednesday, more than $360 billion below its Tuesday peak.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/6138c147eedea900193d8d3e?format=jpeg',)",none

2021-09-08,Moneycontrol,Cryptocurrency prices have been falling - here is why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-prices-have-been-falling-here-is-why-7443131.html,"Some analysts fear the move to make bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar could muddy the outlook for El Salvador's quest to seek a more than $1 billion financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin are among the cryptocurrencies that have seen a steep price volatility in the last few days. Bitcoin’s price tumbled more than 17 percent to $43,000 before paring some losses to trade down over 11 percent at $46,000. Earlier bitcoin had hit a session high of $52,948.

Smaller rival ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, fell 11.99 percent. Meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin has fallen over 16 percent.

Just before the steep fall, Bitcoin hit its highest price since May at $52,000, while Ethereum traded traded close to $4,000. Dogecoin had also touched $0.31 per token.

However, the next day Latin American country El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. Polls show Salvadorans are skeptical about using bitcoin and wary of the volatility of the cryptocurrency that critics say could increase regulatory and financial risks for financial institutions. Still, some residents are optimistic.

On Monday, El Salvador bought its first 400 of the cryptocurrency, temporarily pushing prices for bitcoin 1.49 percent higher to more than $52,680.

Some analysts fear the move to make bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar could muddy the outlook for El Salvador's quest to seek a more than $1 billion financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

After Bukele's bitcoin law was approved, rating agency Moody's downgraded El Salvador's creditworthiness, while the country's dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.

The launch of Bitcoin in El Salvador ran into snags following which shares of blockchain-related firms also fell as crypto stocks were hit by trading platform outages.

Coinbase said some transactions were delayed or canceled at ""elevated rates"" and that ""our apps may be experiencing errors."" The exchange later said issues with Coinbase card swipes were resolved and that transactions were going through normally.

The Gemini exchange said it temporarily entered a full-maintenance period to address an exchange-related issue that caused performance trouble. Coinbase shares slid 4.02 percent.

Anything related to cryptocurrencies appeared to suffer. Cryptocurrency miners Riot Blockchain fell 7.38 percent and Marathon Digital Holdings slipped 7.76 percent.

Shares of MicroStrategy Inc, a BTC buyer and business intelligence software firm, fell 7.64 percent.

But, the major focus was on El Salvador, where the government had to temporarily unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand.

Some analysts attributed such market volatility to El Salvador's implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender affecting user decision to buy in anticipation of the implementation and then selling it off.

“When this move was first announced, it didn’t have nearly as big of an impact on price as some may have expected it might, possibly because El Salvador’s population is less than New York City’s, but also because the announcement was light on details and people were on the fence about how this was going to be implemented,” Leah Wald, CEO at Valkyrie Investments told CNBC.

“Transaction fees, processing times, and other hurdles also make this feel more like a beta test rather than a solution to many of the problems plaguing the country’s poor,” Wald added.

Others disagreed with this reasoning. David Gerard, author of 'Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain,' told the Associated Press (AP) that the Bitcoin volatility on September 7 likely had little-to-nothing to do with El Salvador.

""My first guess was shenanigans, because it’s always shenanigans,"" Gerard said via email to AP.

""It's basically not responding to market forces or regulatory announcements,"" Gerard added. ""That kind of price pattern, where it plummets in a big way in minutes and then rises again, is one of the biggest factors affecting traders.""

Gandhi was speaking at the inaugural session of India’s first ever crypto-asset conference, HODL-2021, organized by the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) of the Internet and Mobile Association of India. Gandhi, in support of cryptocurrency, said, “ It is a valid legal activity.” In the past few months, some favourable developments and acceptance of cryptocurrency across the world has boosted the sentiment and led to a sharp rally in the prices of cryptocurrency. Clearing the fog around regulatory framework and paving the way ahead, Gandhi said that the cryptocurrency needs to be treated as an asset and should be taxed on the basis of its payment channels. “On entry in a citizen’s hand, crypto should be deemed as a foreign asset. Then, it should be paid through normal channels when it is bought, if not, it will be deemed as mined, and the capital gained and taxed heavily. Then if it is proved mined, capital gained and is taxed slightly lightly. It should be fully tracked through a depository or repository of information. Then exchanges can facilitate trade– buy and sell–and settle payment and receipt,"" Gandhi said.

Gandhi also made it clear that once a large section of people start using crypto assets as a mean payment then it would be a matter of concern for monetary authorities. After giant corporations, countries and influential people came out in favour of cryptocurrency, the countries, those who were against this are also striving to make a framework for it. As per many media reports, the Indian government is thinking of defining cryptocurrency as an asset or commodity. It may also come up with a way to define cryptos as per their use cases such as payments, investment or utility. Expressing his concern about the possible monetary transmission using crypto, Gandhi said, “Then the question will arise, whether monetary transmission will be possible or not using crypto. Right now it is not very clear. Here, we can have an open mind about how monetary transmission will take place even through crypto assets. I don’t have any research to confirm that, so, it is my belief that even crypto assets would be sensitive to monetary action.”

Recently, former RBI Governor and a top economist Raghuram Rajan speaking about the possible future of Cryptocurrency said that cryptocurrency may have a “ potential future”.

Rajan seemed optimistic about well-regulated stable coins, which are digital currencies linked to an underlying asset like currency or gold. He, however, pitched for appropriate regulations for such assets. Throwing light on the origin of cryptocurrency, Gandhi said, “Originally, it came out of the mistrust about authoritarian currency, and in a sense, the philosophy was to some anarchist disruption. The idea was that this is a money, which could not be taxed or traced. Thereafter, the principles have completely changed, including in India. Now, more and more people are putting faith in it and they want to deal in it legally,”

The enigmatic space of Metaverse is imperceptibly infiltrating the internet world. Metaverse, an evolved superset of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) literally means 'Beyond Universe' or ‘ Transcending universe’. It was first coined in Neal Stephenson ’s 1992 Science fiction novel ‘Snow Crash’. According to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , Metaverse will be the embodied internet where instead of just viewing content, we will be in it having different experiences that one couldn’t necessarily have on a 2D app or webpage.Did you ever imagine that a sci-fi world time-machine will become a reality? Well, we could be close to it because in the simulated world of Metaverse. At some point in the future, people will be able to enter the metaverse, virtually of course, and interact with the elements there, with help from AR and VR, according to a Forbes report.Metaverse could well be hailed as the culmination of the internet, where cyberspace is an ever- expanding, never-ending and parallel-digital universe, connected to our physical world.But the gaming industry is already suffused with Metaverse, which can be seen in popular video games likeMetaverse is not just gaming after all and is already being envisioned by Mark Zuckerberg as the virtual workspaces, which he called “infinity offices that allow for greater multitasking.” Meetings in the metaverse would be intrinsically more collaborative and productive than zoom calls.Venture capitalist, Matthew Ball also believes Metaverse is the gateway to most digital experiences and it will be the driving force in creating a new generation of companies, similar to what happened with the popularization of the internet. In his 2020 essay, he had said that the Metaverse will span the physical and virtual worlds, contain a full- fledged economy, and offer unprecedented interoperability. This means that users will be able to take their avatars and goods from one place in the metaverse to another, no matter who runs that particular part of it, he had written.Now NFTs, as we know, are intangible digital art that could include photos, videos, music, clip-art, downloaded into an AI. It is created by minting digital assets on a blockchain.All three - Metaverse, NFTs and cryptocurrency - are built using blockchains and decentralized applications. Because of being blockchain-based products, buying and using Metaverse and NFTs with cryptocurrency would be the most preferred and viable choice in the present and in near future.NFTs will play a key role in Metaverse-based games giving players greater control over their characters. At some point in the future, users will be able to trade in virtual goods too. Here as well, cryptocurrencies could become the sole legal tender used in the metaverse, with all virtual objects and intangible items being expressed as NFTs.It’s impossible for Metaverse, NFTs and cryptocurrencies to operate in isolation, and things are only going to get more exciting from here on.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-86029271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-13532,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Despite the fluctuations, the cryptocurrency market has grown phenomenally.

In India, this market has grown from $923 million in April 2020 to $6.6 billion in May 2021, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform. Among 154 nations, India ranks 11th in cryptocurrency adoption, it said.

Bitcoin was one of the earliest cryptocurrency, which was lapped up by investors. Since then, many new platforms have emerged, which are mostly powered by blockchain technology.

What is blockchain?

A blockchain is a database that is shared across a network of computers. In fact, it is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency.

Blockchain uses strong encryption techniques to keep a check on the creation of monetary units and verify the transfer of funds. Once a record has been added to the chain, it is very difficult to change. To ensure all the copies of the database are the same, the network makes constant checks.

Blockchain has been used to underpin cyber-currencies like bitcoin, but many other possible uses are emerging.

Solana

It is believed to be the fastest growing blockchain network in the world of cryptocurrency. Solana has a block time of 400 milliseconds and transaction fees of less than $0.01.

Its token - a virtual denomination of a cryptocurrency - is SOL. It has jumped to the seventh spot among the world’s top 10 largest virtual coins amid optimism that the blockchain could be a long term competitor to Ethereum.

Solana’s SOL token has tripled in about three weeks and now has a market value of more than $41 billion, according to CoinGecko.

Metaverse

The coronavirus pandemic has sparked huge interest in shared virtual environments, or the ""metaverse"". First coined in science fiction, the term is a combination of the prefix ""meta"", meaning beyond, and ""universe"".

It refers to shared virtual worlds where land, buildings, avatars and even names can be bought and sold, often using cryptocurrency. In these environments, people can wander around with friends, visit buildings, buy goods and services, and attend events.

The term covers a wide variety of virtual realities, from workplace tools to games and community platforms.

Binance

It is a cryptocurrency exchange which claims to be the largest in the world in terms of daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies. According to its website, Binance was founded in 2017 and is registered in the Cayman Islands.

Binance is in trouble as Singapore's central bank recently said that it should stop offering payment services. The Monetary Authority of Singapore warned last week that Binance's website could be breaking the law by providing payment services to Singapore residents without an appropriate licence.

After the blow, the exchange has said that it will it will restrict its services in Singapore from September 10.

Binance entered India in 2019.

India and cryptocurrency

Several digital currency exchanges are eyeing India to launch trading platform to capture the growing domestic crypto market. However, the fate of cryptocurrency in India is still unclear.

The government was set to present a bill to parliament by March that proposed a ban on cryptocurrencies, making trading and holding them illegal. But the bill was not tabled in the session and there is uncertainty about the government's plans.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently said it is planning to launch its own digital currency by December.","('https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2021/09/08/1600x900/Cryptocurrency_exchange_Binance__1631077793651_1631077793840.JPG',)",none

A bitcoin trader says she is running out of options after being booted from 90 banks across Australia.

Michaela Juric has been trading virtual currency for seven years but her business, Bitcoin Babe, is now under threat due to financial institutions’ refusal to do business with her.

The banks named and shamed by Ms Juric in a parliamentary hearing into Australia’s technology and financial sector include Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Suncorp.

“As of yesterday, I have been debanked and banned from 91 banks and financial institutions,” she said.

“There‘s been instances where de-banking has caused me to be denied from being able to get utilities or phone and internet services, which I think is very concerning.”

Debanking is when a bank chooses to no longer offer banking services to a customer.

In some cases, Ms Juric’s customers have received calls from their own banks warning her bitcoin services were a scam, or had also debanked them all together.

Aus Merchant, a digital currency brokerage, has experienced four debanking experiences in the past 12 months.

Managing director Mitchell Travers said the situation was causing the company to move to offshore banking.

“We are regulated by AUSTRAC, and offer all of our compliance documentation to support onboarding, and yet get a default negative response causing our business to seriously consider moving our traditional banking offshore,” he said in a submission to the hearing.

He told the committee the big four banks adopted the policy as a stopgap measure to avoid competition.

“With the sort of anti-competitive nature of the banks, it’s somewhat buying them time,” Mr Travers said.

“It could be considered a stopgap for them as they sort of educate and find a way to enter the space in a more profound manner.”

FinTech Australia echoed Mr Travers comments, saying the practice was a big issue across the market.

“The issue is complex, as it affects companies broadly across different fintech verticals, such as payments, loans, remittance services, crypto-asset exchanges and others,” FinTech Australia said.

AUSTRAC and its anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing laws, along with anti-competitive conduct, were labelled as the two major issues by the industry group.

In a submission to the inquiry, NAB chief executive Ross McEwan said the bank may choose to debank a customer if companies were using banking products for purposes which they were not intended.

“A product may be designed and offered according to certain commercial, risk or regulatory parameters,” Mr McEwan said.

“NAB may stop offering that product to a customer if it is not being used in line with its intended design or use.”

CBA said it would cease a relationship with a customer if the “source of funds and source of wealth was unable to be determined”.

In the 12 months to June, Westpac estimated it had exited eight fintech businesses.

“Westpac does not consider fintech to be higher risk or out of appetite per se,” group executive Les Vance said.

The major banks say current legislation is the issue. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Joel Carrett

“However, there could be segments of the fintech sector that operate in higher risk areas or have higher risk aspects and these may result in a decision to decline or cease to offer banking services.”

Ms Juric told the committee she was registered with AUSTRAC but that made little difference to the banks’ response.

According to Home Affairs and AUSTRAC, the legislation does not mandate debanking.

“A decision to ‘debank’ a particular customer sits with the relevant financial institution, and the AML/CTF Act does not mandate this practice,” the department said.

“A range of additional factors may lead to a customer being debanked, e.g. commercial considerations; reputational risk; uncertainty associated with new business models; expectations of overseas correspondent banks and a range of other regulatory requirements relevant to the financial sector.”

Committee Chair Andrew Bragg said the practice must be addressed. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Gary Ramage

Senator Andrew Bragg, inquiry chair, told NCA Newswire the committee would be putting together a plan to address the practice of debanking.

“A lacking regulatory framework has been identified by major banks for debanking of fintechs and cryptocurrency businesses. These may be legitimate issues or an anti competitive approach or both,” he said.

“We don’t tell people who to bank in Australia but we do expect that anti competitive behaviour won’t be tolerated. And that’s what a lot of the de-banking is: anti competitive behaviour.

“We will come up with a plan to address the issues flagged by the banks so there are no more de banking excuses.”","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/368917d3f21efebf3f3503f5f0f87631',)",none

Bitcoin price

In the past two sessions, bitcoin price saw a major decline below the USD 50,000 support. BTC broke many supports near USD 48,000 and USD 46,200. It even tested USD 43,000 before the bulls appeared. The price is now correcting losses and it is back above USD 45,000. An immediate resistance is near the USD 47,200. The next major resistance is near the USD 48,400 level, above which the price could test USD 50,000.

If there is no recovery above USD 48,400, the price could resume its decline. The main support is near USD 45,500, below which the price could revisit USD 43,000.

Ethereum price

Ethereum price also followed a similar path after it broke the USD 3,800 support. ETH declined over USD 800 and it even tested the USD 3,000 support zone. Recently, there was a recovery wave above USD 3,200 and USD 3,350. The price is now facing resistance near the USD 3,500 level.

The next major resistance is now forming near USD 3,550, above which the price might start a steady increase towards the USD 3,680 level in the near term.

ADA, LTC, DOGE, and XRP price

Cardano (ADA) failed to stay above the USD 2.65 support. It declined heavily below the USD 2.50 and USD 2.20 support levels. The bulls appeared near USD 2.00 and the price recovered above USD 2.40. To start a fresh increase, the price must reclaim the USD 2.65 pivot level.

Litecoin (LTC) trimmed all its gains and declined heavily below USD 200. The price even broke the USD 188 support level and tested USD 162. It is now recovering, but the previous support at USD 185 and USD 188 could act as hurdles in the coming sessions.

Dogecoin (DOGE) declined nearly 20% and it traded below the USD 0.280 support. The price even declined below USD 0.250 and tested USD 0.220. It is now consolidating near the USD 0.250 level. If it clears the USD 0.265 resistance, there might be a move towards USD 0.280.

XRP price fell sharply below USD 1.25 and USD 1.20. It even traded below USD 1.12 and spiked below USD 1.00. However, the bulls defended more losses and the price recovered above USD 1.05. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 1.15 level. The first key resistance is now near the USD 1.20 level.

2021-09-08,Gadgets 360,"Bitcoin in El Salvador: World-First Adoption of Cryptocurrency Sees Angry Protest, Glitches, and a Dip",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-price-cryptocurrency-el-salvador-adoption-protest-technical-glitch-dip-rout-2533578,"El Salvador's historic adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender on Tuesday was beset by teething problems, as an angry protest by mistrustful citizens, technological glitches, and a dip in the cryptocurrency clouded the rollout.

The bold experiment got off to a bumpy start when shortly after midnight, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele complained the government-backed Bitcoin app was not available on various Internet platforms including Apple and Huawei. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 37.4 lakhs as of 10am IST on September 8.

Bukele used his Twitter account to press online stores to stock the app, or digital wallet, known as Chivo, and Huawei later began making it available. But when the app proved unable to cope with user registrations, the government unplugged it in order to connect to more servers and increase capacity.

Still, as the app began appearing on more platforms, Bukele was by afternoon retweeting videos posted on social media with people making payments using Bitcoin at retailers in El Salvador including McDonald's and Starbucks.

""El Salvador is taking a great step forward today,"" said Carlos Garcia, who went to a booth at a San Salvador shopping mall giving out advice on how the new currency would work.

Starbucks' El Salvador unit said it was accepting Bitcoin for purchases at its restaurants, drive-through facilities or to go.

Promising $30 (roughly Rs. 2,200) of Bitcoin for each user, Bukele has pushed for its adoption, saying it will help Salvadorans save $400 million (roughly Rs. 2,940 crores) a year on commissions for remittances, while giving access to financial services to people with no bank account.

""We must break the paradigms of the past,"" Bukele tweeted. ""El Salvador has the right to advance towards the first world.""

Bukele, 40, is one of the most popular presidents in the Americas, but has been accused of eroding democracy. Opinion polls showed Salvadorans are skeptical about using Bitcoin, fearing its volatility and unsure of how it will work.

More than 1,000 people held a protest in San Salvador on Tuesday against the adoption of Bitcoin, burning a tire and setting off fireworks in front of the Supreme Court.

As the currency's price wobbled, the government purchased an additional 150 Bitcoins on Tuesday, worth around $7 million (roughly Rs. 51.4 crores).

Still, the poorest may struggle to access the technology needed to make Bitcoin work in El Salvador, where nearly half the population has no internet access and many more only have spotty connectivity.

""I'm going to continue suffering with or without Bitcoin,"" said sweets seller Jose Herrera, who said he had trouble accessing a mobile phone.

Some say the adoption of Bitcoin may fuel illicit transactions and financial instability. It has already muddied the outlook for more than $1 billion (roughly Rs. 7,350 crores) in financing that El Salvador is seeking from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

US TENSIONS

Ahead of the launch, El Salvador bought 400 Bitcoins worth around $20 million (roughly Rs. 146 crores), Bukele said, helping drive its price above $52,000 (roughly Rs. 38.2 lakhs) for the first time since May. Hours later, Bitcoin had weakened and last traded down 0.51 percent at $46,561.74 (roughly Rs. 34.2 lakhs).

Ethereum, another crypto currency, fell 0.32 percent to $3,404.05 (roughly Rs. 2.5 lakhs), while crypto exchange Coinbase Global slid 4.18 percent after reporting delays in some transactions on its platform. Ether price in India stood at Rs. 2.77 lakhs as of 10am IST on September 8.

The change means businesses should accept payment in Bitcoin alongside the US dollar, which has been El Salvador's official currency since 2001 and will remain legal tender.

It remains unclear whether businesses will be penalised if they do not accept Bitcoin.

In the run-up to the launch, the government installed ATMs that allow Bitcoin to be converted into dollars and withdrawn without commission from the digital wallet Chivo.

Bukele blamed Apple, Alphabet's Google, and Huawei's app download platforms for the initial Chivo delay.

""Release him! @Apple @Google and @Huawei,"" Bukele wrote in a tweet, which was accompanied by a red-faced ""angry"" emoji.

The wallet was later available from Huawei and Apple.

A spokesman for Huawei said the company's platform showed less than a thousand installations by late afternoon on Tuesday.

""Like all innovations, El Salvador's Bitcoin process has a learning curve,"" Bukele said in a tweet. ""Not everything will be achieved in a day, or in a month.""

In barely two years in office, Bukele has taken control of almost all levers of power. But although he has promised to clean up graft, the US recently put some of his close allies on a corruption blacklist.

Last week, top judges appointed by Bukele's lawmakers ruled that he could serve a second term, breaking away from a constitutional rule that forbade consecutive terms.

Analysts fear the adoption of Bitcoin, whose transaction records are distributed across the Internet, beyond the reach of national jurisdictions, could encourage money laundering.

After the Bitcoin law was approved, the ratings agency Moody's downgraded El Salvador's creditworthiness, while its dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.

The World Bank reiterated on Tuesday it could not help El Salvador in adopting Bitcoin ""given environmental and transparency shortcomings,"" a bank spokesperson said.

Bitcoin managed to maintain a market dominance of 42.01 per cent, which indicated an increase of 0.27 per cent over the day according to data from the crypto listing website. It had also maintained a market cap of $885.59 billion.

Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex said, “Bitcoin reversed its bullish momentum and slumped towards $43,000 from its initial position. Several investors who didn’t have a stop loss in place rushed for cover and booked profits. More than 329,483 traders got liquidated over the past 24 hours.

The coin was also trading 10.13 per cent down over the last seven days.

Patel went on to add, “The total value of liquidations crossed 2.6 billion dollars in just one hour. Although the selloff lasted across the crypto spectrum, with most of the coins having double-digit losses, Solana outperformed for yet another day. The SOL token created a day’s high of $215 and rose more than 13 per cent.”

The global crypto market cap stood at $2.11 trillion on Wednesday. This indicated a decrease of 11.30 per cent over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours was 241.26 billion, which was a 70.57 per cent increase, data revealed.

Crypto transactions should be taxed based on payment channels, tracked through repository: R Gandhi



Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor R Gandhi is of the view that cryptocurrencies should be treated as a foreign asset once they reach citizens. Speaking at the first edition of the Crypto Asset Conference HODL 2021, Gandhi said that it should be possible to track crypto transactions through a central repository. Sumit Gupta, Co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX stressed how regulators should not look at clamping down the technology as it evolves, usually faster than the time taken to frame laws around it.

However, the rollout stumbled in its first hours and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the digital wallet used for transactions was not functioning.

Tuesday’s selloff is the most significant break in the rebound that had lifted Bitcoin almost 75% since late July. Overall cryptocurrency market value fell about $300 billion in the past 24 hours, according to tracker CoinGecko.

The world's largest cryptocurrency staged a small recovery as Bitcoin prices today were at around $46,757, down 11%. Meanwhile, other digital coins followed the lead with ether fell over 11% to $3,471 whereas dogecoin and cardano prices plunged 15% and 12% to $0.26 and $2.5 respectively. Stellar, XRP, Uniswap also crashed in the range of 15-20% over the last 24 hours.

“Social media platforms were very cautious over the weekend that a plunge could occur following El Salvador’s big day,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., wrote in a note, as reported by Bloomberg. Some investors likely bought in anticipation of the nation implementing its Bitcoin law Sept. 7 and then moved to “sell the fact,"" he said.

According to experts, bitcoin was still in the bull market as long the price stayed above the $43,000 level.

Billionaire Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings and a long-time cryptocurrency bull, told Bloomberg the market for digital coins was running strong over the last eight weeks and became overbought. Interest from individual investors spiked on the back of large institutions jumping on board the crypto wagon, he said.

David Gerard, author of “Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain,"" told the Associated Press that Tuesday’s Bitcoin volatility likely had little to nothing to do with El Salvador. “My first guess was shenanigans, because it’s always shenanigans,"" Gerard said via email to AP.

“Bitcoin basically doesn’t respond to market forces or regulatory announcements,"" Gerard said. “That sort of price pattern, where it crashes hugely in minutes then goes back up again, is usually one of the big guys burning the margin traders."" Because Bitcoin is so thinly traded, it could also have been a big holder making a large sale to have cash, thus sending the market for a ride, Gerard said.

2021-09-08,CNET,Bitcoin falls as El Salvador’s cryptocurrency gamble stumbles,https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-falls-as-el-salvadors-cryptocurrency-gamble-stumbles/,"Bloomberg/Getty

Number go up, number go down. After climbing to just under $53,000 on Monday, Bitcoin fell precipitously on Tuesday. The price briefly dipped to just over $43,000, but at time of writing stands at $46,925. Other currencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin saw similar falls.

Cryptocurrencies are decentralised and notoriously volatile, so it's often difficult to precisely pinpoint the cause of such sharp price movements. In this case, however, it appears to be tied to El Salvador, where Bitcoin officially became legal tender on Tuesday.

El Salvador's government created a digital wallet for its 6.4 million citizens to use, which would come with $30-worth of Bitcoin preloaded. (That's about 0.0007 Bitcoin.) At first, the wallet wasn't available through Apple and Huawei app stores. After President Nayib Bukele pressed all online app ecosystems to add the Chivo app, the digital wallet was overwhelmed with traffic and had to briefly be taken offline.

Bukele, who at 40 years old is an unusually young world leader, went on to joke about the Bitcoin price drop on Twitter. ""Buying the dip,"" he tweeted with a winking Emoji, a quip commonly made by cryptocurrency traders exposed to sharp price drops. He said El Salvador bought 150 Bitcoin this morning, bringing its total to 550. (At current price, that's $25.7 million-worth.)

Many El Salvadorians shared videos of Bitcoin being accepted at Starbucks, McDonald's and other retailers -- videos Bukele gleefully retweeted. Bitcoin enthusiasts around the globe pledged to buy $30 worth of the cryptocurrency on Tuesday, dubbed ""Bitcoin Day,"" in support of Bukele.

The adoption of Bitcoin has been poorly received among many other citizens, however. Over 1,000 gathered in San Salvador to protest the move, which they say won't help the country's poorest residents. ""This is a currency that's not going to work for pupusa vendors, bus drivers or shopkeepers,"" a resident told Reuters.

President Bukele, whose political party is literally called ""New Ideas,"" hopes that the mass adoption of Bitcoin will spur forward-thinking foreign investment in the country, and also lower the cost of remittance payments, which currently make up 24% of El Salvador's GDP, according to World Bank data.

Global financial institutions have warned El Salvador against the move. ""Adoption of bitcoin as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues that require very careful analysis,"" said a spokesman for the International Monetary Fund in June. Meanwhile, a World Bank spokesperson told the Washington Post in June: ""While the government did approach us for assistance on Bitcoin, this is not something the World Bank can support given the environmental and transparency shortcomings.""

Bukele, sometimes called Latin America's first millennial president, has rebuffed the criticisms. When influential economist Steve Hanke called it a ""crackpot"" plan, Bukele replied: ""Who is this Boomer?""

""We should break the paradigms of the past,"" Bukele tweeted just prior to the law going into effect. ""El Salvador has the right to advance toward the First World.""","('https://www.cnet.com/a/img/m4BiVSykNzoI-wHyCScpaxsUh_Q=/1200x630/2021/09/08/4b0e228d-cca9-499f-b3cc-c4369e88e336/gettyimages-1235112162.jpg',)",none

The price of bitcoin has plunged in minutes, wiping billions of dollars off the market.

The volatile cryptocurrency dropped from (USD) $50,257 to $43,351, before recovering some ground.

At 6am this morning it was trading at $47,048, having given up 9.11% in the past 24 hours.

The massive price crash came as El Salvador became the first country to introduce bitcoin as legal tender.

The price of bitcoin crashed overnight.

Other cryptos including ethereum have also suffered heavy losses.

“Horrible, horrible chart damage being done in $BTC and the rest of the #crypto market,” crypto trader and author Glen Goodman wrote on Twitter.

Trader and analyst Scott Melker blamed large-volume traders for bitcoin’s plunge.

“Leave it to whales to dump Bitcoin on the day that El Salvador makes it legal tender,” he wrote.

Economist Peter Schiff wrote: “Welcome to #Bitcoin #ElSalvador.

“Your national ‘currency’ just lost over 15% of its purchasing power in under an hour. Get used to it. Just another perfectly orchestrated pump-and-dump by the Bitcoin whales. Too bad this time they had to sacrifice an entire nation to pull it off.”

The plunge wiped billions off the overall market, which is worth about $2.35 trillion.

El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, wrote he would be “buying the dip.”

The plunge was also caused by centralised exchanges liquidating more than $3 billion in long positions.

Liquidations often happen when trades cannot fulfill margin requirements for holding long or short positions, which can exacerbate market drops.

It “looks like it was a standard de-leveraging event,” Rahul Rai from crypto investment firm BlockTower Capital told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin becomes legal tender in El Salvador

Salvadoran consumers can now legally use bitcoin — along with the US dollar which has been the official currency for two decades — to pay for any good or service.

The rollout has been met by much scepticism and fear over the effect of currency volatility on the small Central American country’s ailing economy, and hundreds have taken part in anti-bitcoin protests.

Remittances account for a fifth of El Salvador’s GDP — over $5.9 billion in 2020 — and are vital to revive an economy that contracted 7.9 per cent in 2020 due in large part to the coronavirus pandemic.

Thousands of Salvadorans were already using bitcoin before Tuesday — many of them in the coastal town of El Zonte, where hundreds of businesses and individuals rely on the cyber currency for everything from paying utilities bills to buying a can of soft drink.

Mike Petersen, director of the El Zonte Bitcoin Beach project, said the cryptocurrency had changed the lives of locals.

“They are now able to do online payments, they are able to send money back and forth with family members even hundreds of miles away,” he said.

And the way that law was rammed through and really just the way the government is doing things in general than they are about bitcoin. Here’s some additional thoughts from Mike Peterson at Bitcoin Beach: “How to make sense of the anti-bitcoin views in El Salvador in historical and political context? What are valid concerns and what are not? First it is important to realize that bitcoin in El Salvador has become more political than COVID in the U.S. If you don’t like Nayib Bukele, you now think bitcoin is dangerous and bad for the country. If Nayib Bukele had made bitcoin illegal, they would have been protesting against that. The vast majority have not taken a moment to even attempt to understand bitcoin isn’t the issue. That said, there are also many Nayib Bukele supporters that are also against the law. There are deep historical scars from the abrupt dollarization in 2001 that many Salvadorans feel hurt the poor and benefited the wealthy. They felt the government lied to them. Now, the government is telling them they will be free to keep using dollars, but they are afraid that this will not be true, and that the government will filter the dollars out and they will be forced to use only bitcoin. Obviously, introducing bitcoin as legal tender is very different from what happened in 2001, but to the majority of the older people, it seems like deja vu. We understand it would be impractical at this point in time to solely use bitcoin and there’s no incentive for the government. There are concerns because bitcoin is such a more efficient way to transfer money it will be used in scams and pyramid schemes. This will definitely be widespread and people who don’t understand how Bitcoin works will be more susceptible. They see lots of similarities in the way the Bitcoin law was rolled out overnight. When the country was dollarized, the people were told they could continue to use the Salvadoran colón. In reality, over a short period, the colón was taken out of circulation and ceased to be used. For those that don’t understand bitcoin, they don’t understand that this time it will actually be different. I think that is very understandable. Those who want Nayib Bukele to be hurt by passing the Bitcoin law or fanning these worries, even though they realize that there isn’t real danger.”","('https://www.coindesk.com/pf/resources/images/social/dark/facebook.png?d=86',)",none

2021-09-08,Bitcoin News,Standard Chartered Report Structurally Values Ethereum at '$26K to $35K' – Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-report-structurally-values-ethereum-at-26k-to-35k/,"Standard Chartered Report Structurally Values Ethereum at '$26K to $35K'

A report published by the British bank Standard Chartered indicates the company’s analysts are bullish about the crypto asset ethereum. The bank’s analysts think that bitcoin could reach $175K and said “structurally, we ‘value’ ethereum at $26,000-$35,000.”

British Bank Publishes ‘Ethereum Investor Guide,’ Formulates the Economic Case for Ethereum’

The British multinational banking and financial services giant Standard Chartered has published a report on the two leading cryptocurrencies. In fact, the report is called the “Ethereum Investor Guide” and was written by Geoff Kendrick, Christopher Graham, and Melissa Chan. The report goes into various factors including “structural considerations” like what the “economic case is for Ethereum.”

The Standard Chartered research report notes that “ETH and BTC share many characteristics,” but the Ethereum blockchain has things like smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), decentralized finance (defi), non-fungible token (NFT) assets, and initial coin offerings (ICOs). Despite the myriad of applicable use cases Ethereum offers, the bank does say there could be a greater risk than it would be with bitcoin (BTC).

“While potential returns may be greater for ETH than for BTC, risks are also higher,” the three Standard Chartered researchers said.

In addition to the NFTs, DAOs, defi, ICOs, and other applications, Standard Chartered’s report highlighted the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 transition. “The shift has obvious environmental advantages,” Standard Chartered’s researchers stressed. “As it removes the need for excessive computer power to be used in ‘mining.’ The switch from [proof-of-work (PoW)] to [proof-of-stake (PoS)] is expected to be gradually phased in during H1 2022,” Kendrick, Graham, and Chan said.

Standard Chartered also discussed subjects like “sharding,” “from EVM to eWASM,” and the overall supply of ether. It also notes that scaling Ethereum and the ETH 2.0 rollout is a difficult task. “ETH 2.0 is complex,” the writers insist. “[And] a comprehensive upgrade to an already complex platform. The complexity is compounded by the fact that both ETH 1.0 and ETH 2.0 are running in parallel for a protracted period,” the researchers state.

The Standard Chartered report also takes into consideration the “regulatory landscape,” and “competitive landscape.” It mentions blockchains that are competing with Ethereum in the world of defi, NFTs, and decentralized applications (dapps). “Separate ecosystems already exist and may continue to challenge Ethereum in niche areas,” the report emphasizes. Moreover, “regulatory concerns related to Ethereum will be very different to those than Bitcoin,” the bank’s report concludes.

NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The price of cryptocurrencies plunged and crypto trading was delayed on Tuesday, a day in which El Salvador ran into snags as the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.

Shares of blockchain-related firms also fell as crypto stocks were hit by trading platform outages. But the major focus was on El Salvador, where the government had to temporarily unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand.

Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, tumbled more than 17% to $43,000 before paring some losses to trade down 9.20% at $47,140.27. Earlier bitcoin had hit a session high of $52,948.00.

Smaller rival ether , the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, fell 11.99%.

Major cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) and Kraken said they faced delays in some transactions on their platforms.

Coinbase said some transactions were delayed or canceled at ""elevated rates"" and that ""our apps may be experiencing errors."" The exchange later said issues with Coinbase card swipes were resolved and that transactions were going through normally.

The Gemini exchange said it temporarily entered a full-maintenance period to address an exchange-related issue that caused performance trouble.

Coinbase (COIN.O) shares slid 4.02%.

Anything related to cryptocurrencies appeared to suffer. Cryptocurrency miners Riot Blockchain (RIOT.O) fell 7.38% and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA.O) slipped 7.76%.

Shares of MicroStrategy Inc (MSTR.O), a BTC buyer and business intelligence software firm, fell 7.64%.

2021-09-08,Bitcoin News,Golden State Warriors Point Guard Stephen Curry Asks for Advice About Cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/golden-state-warriors-point-guard-stephen-curry-asks-for-advice-about-cryptocurrencies/,"Golden State Warriors Point Guard Stephen Curry Asks for Advice About Cryptocurrencies

The popular Golden State Warriors point guard, Stephen Curry, asked his 15.5 million followers for some “advice” about crypto. Curry said he was “just getting started” and a great number of people shared advice with the professional basketball player.

Stephen Curry Gets ‘Advice’ From Crypto Twitter

Well known athletes, celebrities, and musicians worldwide have been getting into digital currencies and asking fans for pointers. Recently, Bitcoin.com News reported on the American rapper Busta Rhymes asking about cryptocurrencies and whether or not he should “buy in.” Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson asked his fans whether they preferred bitcoin (BTC) or ethereum (ETH). The “Legally Blonde” star, actress Reese Witherspoon, told her 2.9 million Twitter followers that she just bought ethereum. Witherspoon said:

Just bought my first ETH. Let’s do this #cryptotwitter

Now the star point guard for the Golden State Warriors, Stephen Curry, has tweeted about cryptocurrencies and is looking for advice. “Just getting started in the crypto game… y’all got any advice?” Curry asked on September 7. Of course, Curry got a lot of responses from crypto supporters shilling their favorite blockchain-based assets. One person said he should ignore what people on crypto Twitter say. “Yes. Ignore all Twitter crypto advice,” the person replied to Curry. A number of others used the opportunity to ask the Golden State Warriors star for an interview about crypto.

Microstrategy CEO Speaks Up, Tribalistic Crypto Comments and Shilling Taint Conversation

Microstrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor told Curry to direct message him if he needed. “Steph, I spent more than a thousand hours considering this question and chose bitcoin,” Saylor said. “So far, I have purchased more than $3 billion in BTC because I think it’s the future of digital property. I have posted tons of free bitcoin education on hope.com (or DM me).” Alongside commentary of people telling Curry why he should buy this or that crypto asset, bitcoin maximalists — as per usual — and those who support a variety of alternative blockchains, had to throw in tribalistic shade comments and argue in Curry’s Twitter thread.

The finance writer Frances Coppola said “don’t” to Curry’s tweet and the Human Rights Foundation’s Alex Gladstein remarked: “Consider making small gifts in Bitcoin to charities that you care about and support with the condition that they can’t spend it for 4 years.” Numerous people commented on the fact that Curry had a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible token (NFT) as his Twitter profile picture. While some loved the BAYC profile pic, others showed distaste for the NFT picture.

“Take the silly ape off your profile, it’s like waving around and idiot flag,” the well-known bitcoin artist dubbed ‘Fractal Encrypt’ wrote. “Next do intense research and learn about the Bitcoin vs. sh**coin dichotomy,” the artist added. In contrast to comments like that, NFT fans shilled their favorite BAYC NFTs and told the professional basketball player to look into other NFT collections.

With all the tribalism, the shilling of coins and different NFT collections, probably the best advice Stephen Curry got from Twitter was to “Ignore all Twitter crypto advice.” At the time of writing, that specific reply to Curry has close to 20,000 likes and hundreds of retweets.

2021-09-08,CNBC,Bitcoin tumbles nearly 10% as El Salvador adopts it as legal tender,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/07/bitcoin-retreats-from-the-highest-level-since-may-as-el-salvador-adopts-it-as-legal-tender.html,"The price of bitcoin fell Tuesday after breaking through $52,000 late Monday, reaching its highest level since May.

The price action comes on the day El Salvador is set to adopt the largest cryptocurrency by market cap as legal tender, becoming the first country to do so. Bitcoin dropped as much as 16% on Tuesday morning. It was last down about 9.5% and trading at $46,892.04, according to Coin Metrics. Ether fell 12% to $3,441.21.

Crypto adjacent stocks MicroStrategy and Coinbase also lost about 9% and 4%, respectively. Coinbase users were experiencing delayed or canceled transactions at ""elevated rates"" in the morning, the company said in an update on Twitter, but those issues were resolved by the afternoon. Major crypto exchanges Kraken and Gemini were also investigating delays and performance issues.

Early Tuesday El Salvador temporarily disabled Chivo, its government-run bitcoin wallet, to increase the capacity of the servers, which were hindering new users from installing it, President Nayib Bukele announced in a tweet at about 7:00 a.m. EST.

""Any data they try to enter at this time will give them an error,"" he said. ""This is a relatively straightforward problem, but it cannot be fixed with the system connected.""

The market action is unsurprising, according to Leah Wald, CEO at Valkyrie Investments, who said the news was largely priced into the market ""a while ago.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106892639-1622836826337-bit.jpg?v=1631045758',)",none
2021-09-08,Reuters,El Salvador's world-first adoption of bitcoin endures bumpy first day,https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/el-salvador-leads-world-into-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-09-07/,"SAN SALVADOR, Sept 7 (Reuters) - El Salvador's historic adoption of bitcoin as legal tender on Tuesday was beset by teething problems, as an angry protest by mistrustful citizens, technological glitches and a dip in the cryptocurrency clouded the rollout.

The bold experiment got off to a bumpy start when shortly after midnight, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele complained the government-backed bitcoin app was not available on various internet platforms including Apple and Huawei.

Bukele used his Twitter account to press online stores to stock the app, or digital wallet, known as Chivo, and Huawei later began making it available. But when the app proved unable to cope with user registrations, the government unplugged it in order to connect to more servers and increase capacity.

Still, as the app began appearing on more platforms, Bukele was by afternoon retweeting videos posted on social media with people making payments using bitcoin at retailers in El Salvador including McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O).

""El Salvador is taking a great step forward today,"" said Carlos Garcia, who went to a booth at a San Salvador shopping mall giving out advice on how the new currency would work.

Starbucks' El Salvador unit said it was accepting bitcoin for purchases at its restaurants, drive-through facilities or to go.

Promising $30 of bitcoin for each user, Bukele has pushed for its adoption, saying it will help Salvadorans save $400 million a year on commissions for remittances, while giving access to financial services to people with no bank account.

""We must break the paradigms of the past,"" Bukele tweeted. ""El Salvador has the right to advance towards the first world.""

Bukele, 40, is one of the most popular presidents in the Americas, but has been accused of eroding democracy. Opinion polls showed Salvadorans are skeptical about using bitcoin, fearing its volatility and unsure of how it will work.

More than 1,000 people held a protest in San Salvador on Tuesday against the adoption of bitcoin, burning a tire and setting off fireworks in front of the Supreme Court.

As the currency's price wobbled, the government purchased an additional 150 bitcoins on Tuesday, worth around $7 million.

Still, the poorest may struggle to access the technology needed to make bitcoin work in El Salvador, where nearly half the population has no internet access and many more only have spotty connectivity.

""I'm going to continue suffering with or without bitcoin,"" said sweets seller Jose Herrera, who said he had trouble accessing a mobile phone.

Some say the adoption of bitcoin may fuel illicit transactions and financial instability. It has already muddied the outlook for more than $1 billion in financing that El Salvador is seeking from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

U.S. TENSIONS

Ahead of the launch, El Salvador bought 400 bitcoins worth around $20 million, Bukele said, helping drive its price above $52,000 for the first time since May. Hours later, bitcoin had weakened and last traded down 0.51% at $46,561.74.

Ethereum, another crypto currency, fell 0.32% to $3,404.05, while crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN.O) slid 4.18% after reporting delays in some transactions on its platform.

The change means businesses should accept payment in bitcoin alongside the U.S. dollar, which has been El Salvador's official currency since 2001 and will remain legal tender.

It remains unclear whether businesses will be penalized if they do not accept bitcoin.

In the run-up to the launch, the government installed ATMs that allow bitcoin to be converted into dollars and withdrawn without commission from the digital wallet Chivo.

Bukele blamed Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Huawei's app download platforms for the initial Chivo delay.

""Release him! @Apple @Google and @Huawei,"" Bukele wrote in a tweet, which was accompanied by a red-faced ""angry"" emoji.

The wallet was later available from Huawei and Apple.

A spokesman for Huawei said the company's platform showed less than a thousand installations by late afternoon on Tuesday.

""Like all innovations, El Salvador's bitcoin process has a learning curve,"" Bukele said in a tweet. ""Not everything will be achieved in a day, or in a month.""

In barely two years in office, Bukele has taken control of almost all levers of power. But although he has promised to clean up graft, the U.S. recently put some of his close allies on a corruption blacklist.

Last week, top judges appointed by Bukele's lawmakers ruled that he could serve a second term, breaking away from a constitutional rule that forbade consecutive terms.

Analysts fear the adoption of bitcoin, whose transaction records are distributed across the internet, beyond the reach of national jurisdictions, could encourage money laundering.

After the bitcoin law was approved, the ratings agency Moody's downgraded El Salvador's creditworthiness, while its dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.

The World Bank reiterated on Tuesday it could not help El Salvador in adopting bitcoin ""given environmental and transparency shortcomings,"" a bank spokesperson said.

President Nayib Bukele confirmed that the Chivo Wallet had been taken offline following complaints about installation problems. No time has been given for when it will be online again.

He said that server capacity was being increased - a ""relatively straightforward problem to fix"", but one that needs the system to be disconnected.

""Mejor despacio y con buena letra,"" he tweeted, an idiom that translates as ""slowly and with good handwriting"" - meaning that it's better not to rush.

""Un poquito de paciencia,"" he added, meaning ""a little bit of patience"".

Even the Chivo Wallet's website was taken down on Tuesday when a recently passed law recognising Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador took effect.

Citizens have protested against it, complaining that there has been too little explanation from officials about what benefit Bitcoin will bring and how transactions using the cryptocurrency will work.

Claudia Molina, a 42-year-old who sells T-shirts and souvenirs, criticised the plan.

""We don't know the currency. We don’t know where it comes from. We don't know if it's going to bring us profit or loss. We don’t know anything,"" she told Reuters.

""They haven't given us training. They haven't told us what we're going to use or how to make the change,"" she added.

Foreign cryptocurrency enthusiasts have supported El Salvador's move, with a movement stirring for people to buy $30 (£21.76) in the cryptocurrency together to mark the law coming into effect, potentially driving up the price.

Bitcoin has been trading steadily at around $51,000 (£37,000) over the past few days - its highest since May, when it fell sharply after China announced curbs on cryptocurrency transactions - but no price pump has materialised.

El Salvador has begun to install Bitcoin ATMs in cities around the country where citizens will be able to convert their digital tokens into cash, backed by a $150m (£108m) government fund.

Polls have reported that most Salvadorans are opposed to the adoption of Bitcoin, despite the government pledging to provide $30 (£22) in the token to each citizen through the state-provided digital wallet.

Image: President Nayib Bukele confirmed that the digital wallets system was crashing

Carlos Carcah, a professor at El Salvador's Superior School of Economics and Business, argued that adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender ""is not necessary, nor convenient"".

He added: ""As long as there is someone who accepts payment with Bitcoin, the same as they accept dollars, there wouldn't be problems.""

He noted that Bitcoin is extremely volatile, so investors ""run the risk of becoming rich and the next day being poor"".

El Salvador's own currency, the Salvadoran colon, was replaced by the US dollar in 2001.

The country depends heavily on money which citizens based abroad, often in the US, send home and these remittances to El Salvador were worth almost $6bn in 2019, amounting to 16% of El Salvador's gross domestic product.

The country moved to using the US dollar as legal tender as a result of these remittances, and the move to Bitcoin is based on an expectation that more Salvadorans will begin sending money home using the cryptocurrency - and the Chivo Wallet is intended to be available to citizens who are residing abroad.","('https://e3.365dm.com/21/09/1600x900/skynews-bitcoin-el-san-salvador_5502581.jpg?20210906102042',)",none

In seinem jüngst erschienenen Prognosebericht „Crypto Outlook“ zeigt sich Bloomberg-Chefanalyst Mike McGlone unbeeindruckt von den massiven Korrekturen, die der Kryptomarkt nach dem Mai hinnehmen musste.

McGlone sieht Bitcoin und Ethereum massiv im Aufwind, Bitcoin sogar auf dem Weg zu einer dem US-Dollar komplementären Reservewährung. Die Prognose ist für den Chefanalysten Bloombergs eindeutig:

„Wir sehen Ethereum auf dem Weg zu 5.000 US-Dollar und 100.000 Dollar für Bitcoin. Portfolios mit einer Kombination aus Gold und Anleihen erscheinen ohne Bitcoin und Ethereum in der Mischung zunehmend nackt.“

Kurs-Trigger: Nachfrage steigt schneller als das Angebot

Damit gibt er Anlegern den eindeutigen Tipp, in ihren Portfolios zwingend Bitcoin und Ethereum zu berücksichtigen. Kryptowährungen sieht er aus den „schmerzhaften Korrekturen“ im zweiten Quartal 2021 gestärkt hervorgehen:

„Nach einer schmerzhaften Korrektur sehen wir es als wahrscheinlicher an, dass der Kryptomarkt seinen Aufwärtstrend fortsetzt, als dass er unter die Tiefststände des zweiten Quartals fällt. Was Bitcoin und Ethereum davon abhalten könnte, in der zweiten Jahreshälfte neue Höchststände zu erreichen, ist eine schwer zu beantwortende Frage. Steigende Nachfrage und Akzeptanz stehen einem schrumpfenden Angebot gegenüber …“

Zwar räumt er ein, dass der Kryptomarkt nur „Hype und Spekulation“ sein könnte. Ebenso gut könnte es sich aber auch um „eine Revolution im Geld- und Finanzwesen“ handeln, „die sich noch in der Frühphase der Preisfindung befindet“. McGlone bekennt sich zu letztgenannter Interpretation, denn wie zu beobachten sei, stünde „einer starken Korrektur“ eine immer noch wachsende Akzeptanz gegenüber.

Einen weiteren gewichtigen Einflussfaktor sieht er darin, dass Kryptowährungen auch jene erreichen können, die bislang keinen Zugang zu Bankkonten haben. Das würde dem Finanzmarkt weiteres Wachstum bescheren.

Bloomberg sieht BTC und ETH komplementär

Dabei ist es kein Zufall, dass sich McGlone auf Bitcoin und Ethereum fokussiert. Das erscheint angesichts des Umstands, dass es sich um die beiden wertvollsten Kryptowährungen handelt, zwar naheliegend, hat aber damit nur im Ansatz zu tun.

McGlone sieht die beiden Assets in ihrer Kombination. So sei die „erstgeborene Kryptowährung“, also der Bitcoin, inzwischen als Wertespeicher akzeptiert und nachgefragt. Ethereum habe sich mit dem London-Upgrade ebenfalls auf diesen Weg begeben, spiele aber vor allem als Treiber des gesamten Defi-Sektors eine bedeutende Rolle für die Finanzmärkte der Zukunft. Die wahrscheinlichste Entwicklung sei daher, dass beide Währungen „einfach den Kurs beibehalten“ würden – mithin weiter steigen werden.

Den gesamten Crypto-Outlook-Bericht vom 3. September 2021 könnt ihr hier als PDF herunterladen.

Am Sonntag zeigt sich die Dynamik der beiden genannten Währungen abgeschwächt. Der Bitcoin pendelt um 50.000, der Ether knapp unter 4.000 Dollar. Damit stagnieren die Werte um den Nullpunkt. Der Verlierer unter den Top 10 ist Cardano mit einem 24-Stunden-Verlust von 2,2 Prozent – alle anderen pendeln zwischen minus einem und plus einem Prozent.","('https://t3n.de/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bitcoin-strom-teaser.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrency advertisements, particularly from social media influencers, should face regulation according to the head of Britain's financial watchdog, who highlighted a recent ad posted by Kim Kardashian.

Virtual currencies and tokens have attracted interest from amateur investors lured by stellar gains but who also risk big losses and being scammed.

""As we live more and more of our lives online, we can't allow online business to operate in ways we wouldn't tolerate with any other business,"" Charles Randell, head of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said on Monday.

""That includes rules which protect people from investment fraud and scams.""

Kardashian had advertised virtual token Ethereum Max in June in a story feed on her Instagram account, which has more than 200 million followers.

Randell stressed that Ethereum Max was not connected to Ethereum, which is the world's second most popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin.

""When she was recently paid to ask her 250 million Instagram followers to speculate on crypto tokens by 'joining the Ethereum Max Community', it may have been the financial promotion with the single biggest audience reach in history,"" Randell said.

He noted that the post was flagged as an advertisement in line with Instagram's rules.

""But she didn't have to disclose that Ethereum Max -- not to be confused with Ethereum -- was a speculative digital token created a month before by unknown developers.""

Randell stressed that he did not know whether Ethereum Max was a scam.

However, he added that: ""Social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation.""

The FCA has repeatedly warned against the risk of crytocurrencies, arguing that investors can potentially lose all their money because the assets are not backed by the UK government's financial services compensation scheme.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2019/07/4-6-729x435.jpg',)",none
2021-09-08,Cointelegraph,Ethereum layer-twos reportedly processing more transactions than Bitcoin,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-layer-twos-reportedly-processing-more-transactions-than-btc,"Layer-two scaling protocols for Ethereum have surged in adoption in recent months as gas prices climb again, and the layer-two ecosystem is now processing more daily transactions than the Bitcoin network, according to recent findings.

According to CoinMetrics data collated by industry analyst and Week In Ethereum News founder Evan Van Ness, there were more transactions on Ethereum layer twos than on the Bitcoin network on Monday. Layer-two protocols processed around 250,000 transactions for the day, whereas there were around 210,000 on Bitcoin.

Fun fact:



There are already more daily transactions on Ethereum's layer2 (~250k) than on Bitcoin (~210k yesterday per @coinmetrics) $ETH layer2 is just getting started



— Evan Van Ness (@evan_van_ness) September 6, 2021

The analyst revealed that StarkWare processed the most for the period with around 143,000 transactions across a number of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, such as the dYdX exchange and the layer-two nonfungible token platform Immutable X.

Arbitrum, which launched to mainnet on Wednesday, had around 56,000 transactions. Its newly launched Arbitrum One platform is already attracting big names in DeFi, including Aave, Chainlink and Uniswap, which is exploring several layer-two options.

Optimistic Ethereum had around 28,000 transactions for the day according to the researcher. Uniswap deployed its v3 protocol on Optimism in July, it also powers a layer two version of the Synthetix/Kwenta DeFi trading platform.

Van Ness reported that there were a few others comprising the rest, with decentralized exchange Loopring taking the lion’s share.

Bitcoiners pointed out that Van Ness has made a comparison of Ethereum layer twos with Bitcoin’s layer one and provided no information on Bitcoin’s layer-two Lightning Network. Van Ness responded that “my impression, given the low amount locked, is that Lightning has very little traction but I’m happy if someone shows me data to the contrary.”

Strategy lead at Ethereum layer-two technology aggregator Polygon “Sanket” broke down some of the statistics for the network, revealing that smaller transactions were dominant. In a tweet on Tuesday, he stated, “45% of all addresses, across all of their transactions that day, were less than $1.45.”

According to L2 Fees, Loopring remains the most cost-effective platform for transferring Ether (ETH) costing just $0.40 at the time of writing. Matter Labs’ zkSync was around double the cost at $0.83, while Arbitrum One cost $2.75, and Optimism was $5.83 to send ETH on their respective platforms.

Ether itself costs almost $11 for a simple ETH transfer, however, BitInfoCharts reported the average gas cost for all transaction types at around $40 yesterday.","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDkvMTcyYmQyOTMtZWYwOC00ZGQ2LThlNTQtZGE0MTc1M2Y1NWRiLmpwZw==.jpg',)",none
2021-09-08,Bitcoin News,14 Suspects in Cryptocurrency Investment Scam Arrested in Taiwan – Featured Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/14-suspects-cryptocurrency-investment-scam-arrested-taiwan/,"14 Suspects in Cryptocurrency Investment Scam Arrested in Taiwan

Fourteen suspects allegedly behind a cryptocurrency scam have been arrested in Taiwan. According to the country’s Criminal Investigation Bureau, the scheme has defrauded investors out of millions of dollars.

Suspects Behind Crypto Scam in Taiwan Arrested

The country’s Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) explained that the crypto scam allegedly defrauded more than 100 people out of about NT$150 million (US$5.41 million) over the past year. The suspects now face charges of fraud, money laundering, and breaches of the country’s Organized Crime Prevention Act, the Taipei Times reported Sunday.

Kuo Yu-chih, the CIB investigator in charge of the case, explained that a businessman with the last name Chen is believed to be the mastermind behind the fraudulent crypto scheme. He added that the scheme focused on cryptocurrencies ethereum, tronix, and tether. Chen also led the Taipei-based Azure Crypto Co., which offered cryptocurrency and other investment services.

The investigator detailed that Chen promoted crypto investments on social media, promising high earnings. He elaborated:

Chen and his staff set up websites and allegedly used photographs of pretty women to attract mainly male victims, many of whom were in retirement with substantial savings.

The attractive images drew the victims to the websites where they were persuaded to invest via interactions with whom they believed to be the attractive women, Kuo said. Chen and his staff claimed to be financial advisers specializing in cryptocurrency mining.

The bureau revealed that investigators seized ledgers containing the details of more than 100 people who invested in the scheme.

Prior to the arrests, the police monitored the scheme’s activities and online transactions for several months after receiving complaints. The bureau subsequently conducted raids late last month at the company’s office and the residences of Chen and his staff.

The government says accepting it as legal tender will save some $538 million annually in fees on remittances Polls show Salvadorans are skeptical and wary of the volatility of the cryptocurrency

The plan spearheaded by President Nayib Bukele is aimed at allowing Salvadorans to save on $US400 million ($538 million) spent annually in commissions for remittances, mostly sent from the United States.

Last year alone remittances to El Salvador amounted to almost $US6 billion, or 23 per cent of its gross domestic product, one of the highest ratios in the world.

Polls suggests Salvadorans are skeptical about using bitcoin and wary of the volatility of the cryptocurrency that critics argue could increase regulatory and financial risks for financial institutions. Still, some residents are optimistic.

""It's going to be beneficial … we have family in the United States and they can send money at no cost, whereas banks charge to send money from the United States to El Salvador,"" said Reina Isabel Aguilar, a store owner in El Zonte Beach, about 49 kilometres south-west of capital San Salvador.

El Zonte is part of the so-called Bitcoin Beach geared toward making the town one of the world's first bitcoin economies.

In the run-up to the launch, the government has already been installing ATMs of its Chivo digital wallet that will allow the cryptocurrency to be converted into dollars and withdrawn without commission, but Mr Bukele sought on Monday to temper expectations for quick results and asked for patience.

""Like all innovations, El Salvador's bitcoin process has a learning curve. Every road to the future is like this and not everything will be achieved in a day, or in a month,"" Mr Bukele posted on Twitter, a platform he often uses to spruik his achievements or excoriate opponents.

On Monday, El Salvador bought its first 400 of the cyrptocurrency, temporarily pushing prices for bitcoin 1.49 per cent higher to more than $US52,680.

The cryptocurrency has been notoriously volatile. Earlier this year, it rose over $US64,000 in April and fell almost as low as $US30,000 in May.

Some analysts fear the move to make bitcoin legal tender alongside the US dollar could muddy the outlook for El Salvador's quest to seek a more than $US1 billion financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

After Mr Bukele's bitcoin law was approved, rating agency Moody's downgraded El Salvador's creditworthiness, while the country's dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.

But Mr Bukele, who does not shy away from controversy, retweeted on Monday a video that showed his face superimposed on actor Jaime Foxx in a scene from Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino's film about American slavery.

The video portrayed Mr Bukele whipping a slave trader who had the IMF emblem emblazoned on his face.

Mr Bukele later deleted the retweet.

His own tweet said: ""we must break the paradigms of the past. El Salvador has the right to advance towards the first world.""

2021-09-08,PM News Nigeria,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, others pose danger to world economy",https://pmnewsnigeria.com/2021/09/07/bitcoin-ethereum-others-pose-danger-to-world-economy-bawa/,"The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, has said the advancement in digital assets such as cryptocurrencies increasingly portends huge risks to the world economy.

Mr Bawa stated this while delivering his keynote address Monday at the 38th Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime, themed, ‘Economic Crime-Who pays and who should pay?’

Mr Bawa said many criminals now play significant roles in crypto-currency markets.

He said the virtual currencies had become their preferred mediums of transaction for illegal monies.

EFCC’s spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, who captured some highlights of the event in a statement, quoted Mr Bawa as saying, “The developments in new technologies and the growth of cryptocurrencies portrays a far greater danger to the world economy than ever before with many criminals playing significant roles in crypto-currency markets.

“Criminals now elect to transact or receive illegal monies (such as ransom money) for cyber-attacks in cryptocurrencies with Bitcoins and Ethereum as the most commonly used mediums for these exchanges.”

He lamented that “the sophistication and complexity that defines the dynamics of economic crime in the 21st Century continues to evolve, spurred by technological advancement in the global economy that has become borderless and transnational.”

This he said had “inevitably led to the prioritisation of law enforcement action on crimes that drive Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) across the globe”.

Mr Bawa also added that “economic crimes which are largely illegal acts committed for private gain affect the vital structures of global economies, causing significant damage to the Global Financial System and depriving developing nations of the needed resources for sustainable development”.

He noted that developed countries are not immune to the scourge, which, according to him, has “magnified with the proliferation of cyber-crimes which threatens the stability of Global Financial Institutions.”

Mr Bawa said the platform of the event provided an opportunity to interrogate the challenges of economic crimes.

“As the victims of crime continue to suffer globally from the effects of financial crimes, either directly or indirectly as part of a social system, the determination of who pays or who should pay becomes a critical measure of the criminal justice system in place.”

He underlined the imperatives of an impartial judiciary in ensuring that “the perpetrators of acts and not the victims pay for their crimes.”

Mr Bawa also highlighted some of the transparency and accountability achievements of the current administration by President Muhammadu Buhari.

He pointed out that the EFCC, as the rallying point in the fight against economic crimes in Nigeria, has recorded important milestones in investigations, prosecutions and assets recovery.

He said “Since its establishment in 2003, the Commission has recorded no less than 3,500 convictions and recovered assets of significant value including properties in Nigeria, the UK, USA, and the UAE. All these have measurably contributed to the national efforts against economic crimes in Nigeria.”

The EFCC boss charged participants to come up with practical solutions to curb the international threat of economic crimes.

Meanwhile, the chairperson of the symposium, Saul Froomkin, thanked the EFCC boss for his insightful presentation, and the support received from Nigeria in organising the event.

Participants at the symposium were drawn from law enforcement and security agencies, accountability institutions and partners across the world.

The event was organised by the Centre for International Documentation on Organised and Economic Crime (CIDOEC), Jesus College, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.","('https://cdn.pmnewsnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pmnewslogo-75x50.gif',)",none
2021-09-08,Gadgets 360,"Cryptocurrency’s Online Promotions Should Be Governed to Address 'Problematic Content', British Watchdog Says",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-promotion-online-govern-control-content-problem-remove-delete-fca-uk-2532354,"Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) called on Monday for powers to govern the online promotion of cryptoassets to combat a flood of ""problematic content"" which it said has no value.

With some cryptoassets using social media influencers and other celebrities to promote so-called tokens, Britain's finance ministry has already consulted on the need to regulate them.

The rapid growth of cryptoassets has created a new and complex market for regulators around the world to police, with some acting to curb the activities of players in the sector.

The FCA in June banned Binance from undertaking any regulated activity in Britain, saying the global cryptocurrency exchange is not capable of being supervised properly. Binance has said it fully complies with the FCA's requirements.

""There are no assets or real world cashflows underpinning the price of speculative digital tokens, even the better known ones like Bitcoin, and many cannot even boast a scarcity value,"" FCA Chair Charles Randell said in a speech. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 40.64 lakhs as of 10:30am IST on September 7.

He likened the Internet to the Augean stables in Greek mythology, which needed Hercules to divert two rivers to wash away decades of manure.

""We'll need two streams to tackle the problem of online financial scams: appropriate regulation, including self-regulation by online platforms, and robust enforcement by the authorities; and greater consumer awareness about online scams.""

""It's essential to find the right balance between appropriate regulation to protect consumers and markets and encouraging useful new ideas in this space,"" Randell said.

Matthew Nyman, a crypto lawyer at law firm CMS, said Randell's speech was balanced and did not suggest regulating crypto assets any more strictly than shares.

""We are not going to award FCA registration or authorisation to businesses which won't explain basic issues, such as who is responsible for key functions or how they are organised,"" he said. ""That would be token regulation in the worst sense.""

The global Basel committee of banking regulators is consulting on whether holdings by banks of speculative digital tokens should be covered by mandatory full capital charges, which could affect prices of the assets.

""Giving speculative tokens a high risk price tag is likely to make crypto currency dealing and investment very expensive and could limit the number of new institutional entrants,"" Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Landsdown, said.

2021-09-08,The Guardian,"The disastrous voyage of Satoshi, the world’s first cryptocurrency cruise ship",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/sep/07/disastrous-voyage-satoshi-cryptocurrency-cruise-ship-seassteading,"On the evening of 7 December 2010, in a hushed San Francisco auditorium, former Google engineer Patri Friedman sketched out the future of humanity. The event was hosted by the Thiel Foundation, established four years earlier by the arch-libertarian PayPal founder Peter Thiel to “defend and promote freedom in all its dimensions”. From behind a large lectern, Friedman – grandson of Milton Friedman, one of the most influential free-market economists of the last century – laid out his plan. He wanted to transform how and where we live, to abandon life on land and all our decrepit assumptions about the nature of society. He wanted, quite simply, to start a new city in the middle of the ocean.

Friedman called it seasteading: “Homesteading the high seas,” a phrase borrowed from Wayne Gramlich, a software engineer with whom he’d founded the Seasteading Institute in 2008, helped by a $500,000 donation from Thiel. In a four-minute vision-dump, Friedman explained his rationale. Why, he asked, in one of the most advanced countries in the world, were they still using systems of government from 1787? (“If you drove a car from 1787, it would be a horse,” he pointed out.) Government, he believed, needed an upgrade, like a software update for a phone. “Let’s think of government as an industry, where countries are firms and citizens are customers!” he declared.

The difficulty in starting a new form of government, said Friedman, was simply a lack of space. All the land on Earth was taken. What they needed was a new frontier, and that frontier was the ocean. “Let a thousand nations bloom on the high seas,” he proclaimed, with Maoish zeal. He wanted seasteading experiments to start as soon as possible. Within three to six years, he imagined ships being repurposed as floating medical clinics. Within 10 years, he predicted, small communities would be permanently based on platforms out at sea. In a few decades, he hoped there would be floating cities “with millions of people pioneering different ways of living together”.

Politics would be rewritten. The beauty of seasteading was that it offered its inhabitants total freedom and choice. In 2017, Friedman and the “seavangelist” Joe Quirk wrote a book, Seasteading, in which they described how a seasteading community could constantly rearrange itself according to the choices of those who owned the individual floating units. (Quirk now runs the Seasteading Institute; Friedman remains chair of the board.) “Democracy,” the two men wrote, “would be upgraded to a system whereby the smallest minorities, including the individual, could vote with their houses.”

In the decade following Friedman’s talk, a variety of attempts to realise his seasteading vision were all thwarted. “Seavilization,” to use his phrase, remained a fantasy. Then, in October 2020, it seemed his dream might finally come true, when three seasteading enthusiasts bought a 245-metre-long cruise ship called the Pacific Dawn. Grant Romundt, Rüdiger Koch and Chad Elwartowski planned to sail the ship to Panama, where they were based, and park it permanently off the coastline as the centrepiece of a new society trading only in cryptocurrencies. In homage to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of bitcoin’s mysterious inventor (or inventors), they renamed the ship the MS Satoshi. They hoped it would become home to people just like them: digital nomads, startup founders and early bitcoin adopters.

Their vision was utopian, if your idea of utopia is a floating crypto-community in the Caribbean Sea. No longer was seasteading a futuristic ideal; it was, said Romundt, “an actual ship”. The Satoshi also offered a chance to marry two movements, of crypto-devotees and seasteaders, united by their desire for freedom – from convention, regulation, tax. Freedom from the state in all its forms. But converting a cruise ship into a new society proved more challenging than envisaged. The high seas, while appearing borderless and free, are, in fact, some of the most tightly regulated places on Earth. The cruise ship industry in particular is bound by intricate rules. As Romundt put it: “We were like, ‘This is just so hard.’”

As with many stories about techno-libertarian fantasies, the tale of the Satoshi begins in an all-male, quasi-frat house in San Francisco in the late 90s. Romundt – a softly spoken Canadian with the optimistic, healthy glow of someone who combines entrepreneurial success with water sports – was living with a bunch of software engineers, all of whom shared an intense dedication to personal improvement. “I was a huge Tony Robbins fan,” Romundt told me in one of several Zoom calls from his office in Panama. (Robbins’ themes of individual freedom, self-mastery and the accrual of significant wealth are evident from the titles of his books from that time: Unlimited Power; Lessons in Mastery; Unleash the Power Within; The Power to Shape Your Destiny, and, next level, Awaken the Giant Within.)

After his San Francisco stint, Romundt, the son of a hairdresser, created ScissorBoy in 2009, a popular online TV series on hairdressing, and then ScheduleBox, a website which offered a digital receptionist service for hairstylists to book in their clients. (Always digitally inclined, he had, according to his website, the world’s “most advanced mobile paperless office in 1995”.) “I used to work 17 hours a day, so I didn’t have a lot of freedom,” he told me. He did, however, make enough money to semi-retire in 2016 and then spent “no more than five hours a month” running his business. The giant fully awakened, he moved back to Canada, where he lived on a houseboat on Lake Ontario and went kayaking in the mornings as the sun came up. Enraptured by his lifestyle, Romundt wondered why everyone wasn’t living this way. On a flight one day, he saw a man wearing a T-shirt with “Stop arguing. Start seasteading” printed on it. Romundt was curious, they got talking, and the man turned out to be Joe Quirk, who was by this time running the Seasteading Institute.

So far, the Seasteading Institute had experienced variable, or zero, success with its projects. Early ideas for a “Baystead” and “Coaststead” off the coast of San Francisco and a “Clubstead”, a resort off the coast of California, never made the leap to reality. An attempt to create a floating island prototype in French Polynesia in 2017 met with fairly fierce resistance from the people of French Polynesia and collapsed a year later when the government pulled out of the scheme.

After meeting Quirk, Romundt decided he wanted to try again. Quirk introduced him to two other aspiring seasteaders, the passionately libertarian American Elwartowski and the bitcoin-wealthy German engineer Koch. Together, the trio founded a company, Ocean Builders. Using their own money, they funded the first attempt at a single residential seastead, in the form of a floating white octagonal box 12 nautical miles off the coast of Thailand. Elwartowski and his girlfriend, Nadia Summergirl, lived there for two months in early 2018, until the Thai government discovered the seastead’s existence and declared it a threat to the country’s independence, possibly punishable by life imprisonment or death. Elwartowski and Summergirl had to flee the country before the Thai navy dispatched three ships to dismantle the floating box.

The seasteading movement did not die there. In 2019, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski moved their company to Panama, where they had found a government willing to back their next project: the SeaPod. These would be individual floating homes held 3 metres above the water by a single column and a tripod-shaped base beneath the ocean. The man responsible for their design, Koen Olthuis, is a Dutch “aquatect”, an architect specialising in water-based schemes. In rendered drawings, the SeaPods look fantastical, like a giant’s white helmet emerging monstrously from the waves. Inside, every surface is curved, as if you were living within the smooth, colourless confines of a peppermint. Romundt compared the SeaPods to the architecture in The Jetsons, the 60s cartoon where the characters lived in glassy orbs in the sky. “It’s like that,” he told me, “but on water.” The team built a factory from scratch in Linton Bay, a marina on the north coast of Panama, hired a team of about 30 engineers and mechanics, and, in early 2020, began building the first SeaPod prototype.

Progress was slow. Even once they had a successful prototype, Romundt predicted the factory would only make two SeaPods a month. They’d had the idea before of buying a cruise ship – a quick way of scaling up the community – but the cost had always been prohibitive. By autumn 2020, though, the situation had changed. Like many parts of the travel industry, the cruise ship business was collapsing because of the pandemic: multiple cruise lines were going into administration, empty ships filling up ports like abandoned cars in a scrubby field, or being sent to the scrapyard. Cruise ships, the Ocean Builders trio realised, would be going cheap.

Sure enough, they found a bargain. In October 2020, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski bought the ex-P&O cruise ship Pacific Dawn for a reported $9.5m. (Built in 1991 for $280m, the ship could have sold pre-pandemic for more than $100m, one industry insider told me.) They instructed Olthuis to draw up the plans, placing the ship at the heart of a floating community surrounded by SeaPods. “We had a kind of funny idea,” Olthuis told me. In his scheme, the Satoshi would connect, via two looping tunnels on the water, to human-made floating platforms designated for agriculture, manufacturing and parkland. From the air, the whole community would form the shape of the bitcoin B.

The scheme had the support of the Panama government. In fact, the Ministry of Tourism hoped that a new ocean community would be a draw for visitors. In a page-long statement, the ministry told me how a floating development fitted in with its Sustainable Tourism Masterplan 2020-2025, by highlighting the country’s biodiversity and “the blue heritage of Panama”. It didn’t seem to mind the idea of a load of crypto-investors floating off their coastline, not paying any tax.

“Out of adversity comes opportunity, so they say,” wrote Elwartowski, on 10 October 2020, introducing Viva Vivas, the new company that he had created to run the Satoshi. Its name was adapted from the Latin phrase, “vive ut vivas”, meaning “live so that you may live”.

Ten days later, he announced the venture on Reddit: “So, I am buying a cruise ship and naming it MS Satoshi … AMA.” The responses were quick (“Need an apprentice aviation mechanic?” “I know how to use a yo-yo! Any room for me??”) and included the inevitable sceptics. (“Anyone remember the good old days of the Fyre festival?”) But plenty took the proposition seriously and wanted to go over the small print. (“Where is power coming from? Gas? Internet? Food? Water? Toiletries? What taxes will she be subject to?”)

Elwartowski answered every question with grave attention to detail. There would be generators at first, followed quickly by solar power. This would be an eco-friendly crypto-ship. High-speed wireless internet would come from land; utilities would be included in the fees at first, but would be metered when the systems were upgraded: “You don’t want to have pay for someone else’s mining rig in their cabin,” he wrote, referring to the resource-intensive computational process that introduces new crypto “coins” into the system. As for tax, you would not pay any on earnings made from ventures based in territory beyond Panama. You would be free to make, or mine, as much money as you liked. It would be a remote worker’s regulatory paradise.

But as the Reddit Q&A continued, Elwartowski’s meticulous responses revealed some of the more knotty practicalities of life on board. It turned out that the only cooking facilities would be in the restaurant. For safety reasons, no one was allowed to have a microwave in their rooms – though some cabins had mini-fridges, noted Elwartowski, determinedly sidestepping the point. He offered residents a 20% discount at the restaurant and mentioned that some interested cruisers had already talked about renting part of the restaurant kitchen so they could make their own food. “We want entrepreneurs to come up with solutions and try them out,” he wrote, in a valiant attempt to convert a fairly fundamental stumbling block into wild startup energy. “This is your place to try new things.” Not all the Redditors were convinced. “No microwave but mining rig. Incoherent scam.”

Marketing of the Satoshi soon began in earnest. Her 777 cabins were to be auctioned off between 5 and 28 November, while the ship was crossing the Atlantic towards Panama. Viva Vivas listed the options, including cabins with no windows ($570 a month), an ocean view ($629), or a balcony ($719). Ocean Builders held a series of live video calls for potential customers which attracted 200 people at a time, Olthuis told me, with Romundt, an expert steward of the multilateral video call, at the helm.

On the Viva Vivas website, a Frequently Asked Questions page covered the basics of the cabin auction process, fees and logistics. Specially trained staff would be hired to keep the ship Covid-free and through a partnership with a platform called coinpayments.net, multiple cryptocurrencies would be supported for payment, including bitcoin, ethereum, digibyte, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dai, dash, ethereum classic, trueUSD, USD coin, tether, bitcoin SV, electroneum, cloak, doge, eureka coin, xem and monero.

The final entry on the FAQ page, regarding the possibility of having pets on board, gave a bracing insight into the tension between the idea of freedom and the reality of hundreds of people closely cohabiting on a cruise ship. The answer linked to a separate document, containing a 14-point list of conditions including one that declared no animal should exceed 20lbs in weight, and any barking or loud noises could not last for longer than 10 minutes. If a pet repeatedly disturbed the peace – more than three times a month or five times in a year – it would no longer be allowed to live on board. “Any pet related conflict,” instructed point 13, “shall be resolved in accordance with Section V (F) of the Satoshi Purchase Agreement or Section IV (F) of the Satoshi Master Lease, where applicable.” Dogs would only be permitted in balcony cabins, and it was advised that owners buy a specific brand of “porch potty”, a basket of fake grass where your pet could relieve itself. (Pet waste thrown overboard would result in a $200 fine.)

One Reddit respondent – maxcoiner on Reddit, Luke Parker in real life – was as close to the target market of the Satoshi as it was possible to imagine. A longtime follower of the seasteading movement, he was also such an early and successful bitcoin adopter that he and his wife were able to retire early thanks to their investments. The Satoshi was the most plausible idea for a seastead he’d ever heard. “I did not buy a room during the Satoshi’s sale window,” he told me over email, “but it was hard to keep my hand off that button.”

A variety of considerations held him back. “The wife,” as he put it, had her doubts. He wasn’t sure about the “ginormous leap down in luxury” from living in deep residential comfort on land in the US midwest to living in a very small cabin on board a 30-year-old cruise ship. He was worried, too, by the limited facilities – “No kitchen of my own? Tiny bathrooms? Tiny everything?” Also, the constant rocking of the ship on the water: “I just can’t stomach that life around the clock.” He preferred the idea of the SeaPods. If Parker was going to live on a boat, he concluded, he’d prefer to buy his own luxury catamaran.

On 29 November, Elwartowski published another post on the Viva Vivas website, announcing the official opening of the Satoshi in January 2021. “This will be a new experience for all of us so we must manage your expectations,” he warned. The novelty was too much for Parker. “It takes a rare kind of person indeed to move your life on to a deserted cruise ship in Central America with so little information up front,” he told me. If Parker, part of that highly select, freedom-seeking, system-abandoning, overlapping community of seasteaders and bitcoiners, wasn’t going to buy, it was hard to imagine who would. As he put it: “This may have been the smallest sales demographic in history.”

Over 30 years of service, the Satoshi herself had seen enough of the world to know every permutation of life at sea – apart, perhaps from what it might be like to be a permanent home to 2,000 crypto-investors. Built in 1991 in the Fincantieri shipyard in Trieste, Italy, she is one of only two cruise ships designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. (The other, the Crown Princess, was sent to the scrapyard last year, a Covid casualty.) Her first incarnation was as the Regal Princess (owned by Princess Cruises), after which she became the Pacific Dawn (P&O Australia). Throughout her life, she has been admired for her distinctive features: a domed roof rising above the navigation bridge, water slides that curl round her funnel and a stern whose elegantly rounded form is in marked contrast to the blunt, sawn-off rears of some giant cruise liners. Those who prefer an understated cruising experience also appreciate her discreet size: compared to the largest cruise ship in the world, The Symphony of the Seas (18 decks, 23 swimming pools) she is a modest vessel (11 decks, two swimming pools).

For many years, the Pacific Dawn cruised the south Pacific, enjoying a serene phase of life, interrupted only by an onboard swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the time she lost power and came within 70 metres of crashing into the Gateway Bridge on the Brisbane River. In 2011, a devoted Facebook group was established by fans. “Dawnie was the party ship,” remembered one. “I fell in love with my wife all over again,” added another, crediting the ship for his romantic renewal. Then, in 2020, it briefly looked as though Dawnie was set to join her sister on the scrapyard, after her sale to British cruise company, Cruise and Maritime Voyages, collapsed in the pandemic. Her fans were grief-stricken, weeping emojis piling up on the Facebook group. (“Well 2020 just became even shittier,” said Kathie.) When it was revealed that the ship had been rescued by Ocean Builders, there was a wave of relief, if a little mystification at her new name. “She’ll always be Dawn to me.”

On 29 October 2020, Dawn began her journey to Panama, sailing from Limassol, Cyprus to Piraeus, Greece. A week later, she was handed over to her new owners Ocean Builders and officially became the Satoshi. Koch flew over from Panama to cross the Atlantic aboard their new purchase. The team hired a management company, Columbia Cruise Services, to run the ship and provide a minimum crew of about 40 people, mostly Ukrainian, including a cook, engineers and cleaning staff. A seasoned British cruise captain, Peter Harris, arrived to take charge. “We didn’t know anything about running a cruise,” Romundt told me, “so it was like, we didn’t want to have to figure all this stuff out.”

As soon as Capt Harris joined the ship and met Koch on board, he realised there would be challenges ahead. “I was thinking a week into the job, I can see I’m going to be resigning,” Harris told me, immaculate in a striped shirt on a video call from his home in Kent. Koch, he said, was admirable in his ambition, and a likable, law-abiding man, but he was naive about how shipping worked and had an abhorrence of rules. “He didn’t understand the industry,” said Harris, who has the frank, upbeat air of a born leader for whom hierarchy is a kind of creed. “He just thought he could treat it like his own yacht.”

To sail anywhere, Harris explained, a ship requires certificates of seaworthiness. These expired on the day the deal with P&O was completed. Usually, a new buyer would ensure they lasted a couple of months to cover any onward journey, but no one on the Ocean Builders side had checked. By the time Columbia Cruise Services came on board and informed the team of the situation, the contracts had all been signed. Before the Satoshi could cross the Atlantic, the team were obliged to sail the ship to Gibraltar and have her removed from the water, a process known as dry-docking, to perform essential repairs and renew the certificates.

The Atlantic crossing began on 3 December. Harris – who didn’t resign, grateful for the four-month contract mid-pandemic – found it oddly lovely. With only 40 or so people on board, rather than the usual 2,000-odd, the atmosphere was relaxed, if a little surreal. Among other things, P&O had left about 5,000 bottles of wine and 2,000 bottles of spirits on board. Harris asked Koch if he wanted to charge the crew for drinks, but Koch, generous by nature, said no. “Obviously, we restricted them to three drinks a day,” said Harris. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had a crew.”

As the crossing continued, questions about how the project would actually work once the Satoshi arrived in Panama grew more pressing. According to Harris, Elwartowski thought he could convince the Panamanian authorities to let the ship anchor permanently in its waters and de-register as a ship, becoming a floating residence instead, so as to avoid some of the more exacting requirements of maritime law. But while Panama was happy to have the ship moored off its coast, it specified that the ship had to remain officially designated as a ship. Which led to another difficulty: the discharge of sewage. Though the ship had an advanced wastewater management system, which could turn sewage into drinking-quality water, they were not permitted to discharge this wastewater into Panamanian waters, and so would have had to sail 12 miles out every 20 days or so to empty tanks into international waters.

Such obstacles made the ship an off-putting proposition for insurers. No one would agree to cover them. “They wouldn’t even tell us why we weren’t insurable, they just kept saying no,” Romundt said. “It’s kind of hard to remedy something if you don’t know what the problem is.” Of the several insurance experts I asked about this, none were willing to comment on the case, citing a lack of expertise, presumably because no one had ever tried to insure a cruise ship turned floating crypto-community before. Harris, however, had his theories: that a risk-averse insurance industry was wary of both a bitcoin business and a ship that would presumably be mostly populated by quick-to-litigate Americans.

After trying multiple insurers and brokers, Romundt began to realise that the cruise ship industry was, as he put it, “plagued by over-regulation”. (Along with airlines and nuclear power, according to Harris, it’s in “the top three”.) The Ocean Builders’ great freedom project, whose intrinsic purpose was to offer an escape from oppressive rules and bureaucracy, was being hobbled by oppressive rules and bureaucracy. As Elwartowski would reflect a few months later on Reddit: “A cruise ship is not very good for people who want to be free.”

To Romundt, the whole cruise ship business began to seem like an impenetrable old boys’ network. He estimated that, given six months, they could have hired a crack marine legal team and navigated a way through the loopholes. But by mid-December, the Satoshi was already halfway across the Atlantic, burning through gallons of diesel, with a 40-person crew they’d have to keep on board even when she was stationary in Panama because a cruise ship requires constant maintenance. A ship can cost, even when docked, up to $1m a month to run. “Because, you know,” said Romundt, “it’s huge.”

Fuel alone was costing the Ocean Builders trio about $12,000 a day. According to Harris, Koch wanted to try to make the ship more fuel-efficient by installing a smaller engine, which he thought he could do while the ship was at anchor. “We were like, how are you going to cut a hole in the ship’s side big enough to get the engine out, which is below water level, and not sink the ship?” Harris shook his head, his memories of Koch clearly fond, if perplexed. “I was forever saying, ‘No, Rudi you can’t do this; no, Rudi you can’t do that.’”

Before the Satoshi hove into view of the white sands of a Panama beach, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski had to make a call. They couldn’t afford to keep the ship moored and empty for months on end while they tried to solve the insurance problem, a problem they weren’t even sure they’d be able to solve. They were insured to sail her, and they could go on sailing her, but they didn’t want to run a travel company. They wanted to run a floating society of like-minded freedom-lovers arranged in the shape of the bitcoin B. It wasn’t even clear that there were enough people who wanted to do that. Koch admitted to Harris that the cabins weren’t selling.

“It was almost like a fantasy, James Bond-ish,” said one cruise industry insider. “But to their credit they believed in it.”

The dream was over, they realised, before it had even begun. The project was dead, except it wasn’t quite, as they still owned the ship, which was still steaming across the Atlantic with Koch, Harris and the crew on board. The Satoshi, already thousands of miles into a 5,500-nautical-mile voyage, had travelled too far to be turned around mid-ocean, so on she sailed. They’d have to sell her, the Ocean Builders realised, but who was going to be crazy enough to buy a cruise ship in the middle of a pandemic? Only a company who wanted to tear her apart. On 18 December, while she was still at sea, the team announced the sale of the Satoshi to a scrapyard in Alang, India. The Satoshi was once again destined for dismemberment.

On 19 December, Elwartowski announced on the Viva Vivas website that the Satoshi’s journey was coming to an end. “We have lost this round. The New Normal, Great Reset gains another victim,” he wrote, looping in the collapse of the Satoshi with a popular Covid conspiracy theory that the pandemic and its response had been stage-managed by a global elite. (Over subsequent months, Elwartowski’s activity on Reddit would include other Covid themes, including suspicion of government vaccination programmes.) Romundt emailed their list of potential customers to let them know the ship’s fate. Deposits for cabins would be refunded.

The Satoshi arrived in Balboa, Panama on 22 December. On Christmas Eve, she anchored off the coast of Colon. There, Romundt joined Koch and the crew on the ship. Elwartowski, meanwhile, stayed in Panama City. “He didn’t want to get on board,” said Romundt. Koch spoke to Joe Quirk one evening on the phone while he was sitting in the ship’s cafe drinking a bottle of wine, feeling regretful that the onboard hospital he’d planned to open to medical entrepreneurs would never come to life. Even so, Koch was “utterly unbowed”, reported Quirk in a Seasteading Institute blog post entitled How the Grinch Stole the Cruise Ship.

Romundt, a man more driven by the practical issues at hand than the romantic symbolism of his endeavours, realised that, though the entire plan had fallen apart, he was still the part-owner of a massive cruise ship. He decided to spend Christmas on board, along with the crew. Master key in hand, he wandered around the Satoshi, making sure to enter every room that said Do Not Enter. He toured the engine room, and sat on the sun deck. He worked, because he can’t help working, even at Christmas, but he also went on all the water slides, alone. (Harris told me he’d turned them on specially for Christmas Day.) Though Romundt doesn’t usually drink, he had a glass of wine and called all his friends saying, “I’m on my own cruise ship for Christmas!” He had the kind of good time it is perhaps only possible to have when you have just made an unbelievably expensive mistake born of a desire to invent an entirely new way of living and involving the purchase of a huge floating vessel. “I was king of the ship!” he said, still delighted.

Even scrapping the Satoshi proved to be a debacle. After a deal had been done with the Indian scrapyard, the Ocean Builders team realised that according to the Basel Convention, which covers the disposal of hazardous waste, they weren’t allowed to send the ship from a signatory country (Panama) to a non-signatory country (India). The contract with the scrapyard had to be cancelled.

All was not completely lost, at least for the Satoshi herself. The cruise ship industry is a compact ecosystem. The grapevine did its thing. A ship broker heard about the plight of the Satoshi, realised it was precisely the kind of ship a new client of his was looking for, and did a quick deal.

The client was Ambassador Cruise Line, the first British cruise company to launch for 10 years. According to Ambassador’s ebullient, red-sweatered chair, Gordon Wilson, the company’s name is intended to reflect the highly optimistic idea that ambassadors, like cruise ships, take the best of their own culture with them wherever they go. The Satoshi would be the first ship in the company’s new fleet, which would offer cruises to the over-50s. Many of the new team at Ambassador had come over from Cruise and Maritime Voyages, who had nearly bought the Satoshi before it went bust in 2020. As such, they knew the ship well, which sped up the sale. Wilson wouldn’t confirm the amount – “they thought it was a good price” – but the trade press reported that Ocean Builders sold her for $12m, more than they paid for her, though possibly not quite enough to cover the elaborate costs of running an empty cruise ship for three months.

On 23 February 2021, the Satoshi set sail from Panama, heading all the way back across the ocean she’d just crossed. She arrived in Bar, Montenegro on 27 March. Wilson went over to visit her, and, like Romundt, relished the experience of climbing aboard his new asset. Exploring the engine rooms of an empty cruise ship seemed to give these men a particular sensation: perhaps just the buzz of owning something so vast and powerful; a mechanical, proprietary thrill.

The Ocean Builders team, meanwhile, returned to their own private missions. Elwartowski was on sabbatical, Romundt told me. He did not want to talk to me for this story. Koch, who also declined to be interviewed, was building his own boat in Panama, and working with Romundt on the SeaPods. Over Zoom, Romundt gave me a tour of the SeaPod factory, and showed off the hulking sheets of fibreglass that would form the structure’s mould. “It feels like touching a UFO,” he said, stroking his invention.

Seeing the pod’s nascent form, I felt a boringly pragmatic urge to ask Romundt what happened if, once afloat, you needed to buy a pint of milk. My question seemed to miss the point, too wedded to old-fashioned notions of locality and human connection. The Pods had been designed to have a hatch in the roof, Romundt said. He was talking to some drone creators and imagined people flying to their pods independently, landing on the roof and entering through the hatch. Perhaps that’s how you’d get your milk.

At her new home in Montenegro, meanwhile, the Satoshi needed some sprucing up. For the fourth time in her three decades on the water, she had been renamed. “We thought Ambience a lovely name for a ship,” said Wilson, pronouncing it in the French style, Ambi-ence. “This is a very elegant ship,” he added, proudly. “She looks like a cruise liner; she does not look like a floating block of flats.”

When Ambience finally sets sail on her maiden voyage, from the industrial dock of Tilbury across the North Sea to Hamburg in April 2022, she will offer a more traditional experience to her passengers. “Back to what cruising is all about,” said Wilson. The atmosphere will be refined. There will be promenading on deck and plentiful opportunities for photography as the horizon swallows the evening sun. There will be cocktails at the bar, a five-course dinner and a glittery show. It is unlikely bitcoin will be accepted as currency. The water slides will be removed.

This article was amended on 8 September 2021 to include the full name of Ambassador Cruise Line, and to clarify that the Ambience’s dinners will have five courses, not three.","('https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9a64a665016b5916e57cfc3c43ff4dada669f8e/0_261_2750_1649/master/2750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa6a88e32b4f67b2d8a4e4fec1f44c1c',)",none
2021-09-08,Bitcoin News,Visa Plans to Bring Cryptocurrency Services to Traditional Banks in Brazil – Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/visa-plans-to-bring-cryptocurrency-services-to-traditional-banks-in-brazil/,"Visa Plans to Bring Cryptocurrency Services to Traditional Banks in Brazil

Visa, the multinational payments giant, has announced it is planning to bring cryptocurrency services to traditional banking platforms in Brazil. The company also announced that it is working with several cryptocurrency companies in the country to bring cryptocurrency payment cards to the market and hinted at a possible direct integration of bitcoin in payments.

Visa Gears Up for Crypto Integration in Brazil

Credit card giant Visa has announced it plans to integrate cryptocurrency solutions into traditional banking platforms. Eduardo Abreu, Visa’s vice president of new business in Brazil, stated the company has plans to develop applications (APIs) to unite traditional banks with cryptographic products. In this way, it would be possible to make investments in cryptocurrencies and ETFs within banking platforms with no intermediates.

Visa also announced it is working with several national companies to issue cryptocurrency cards. Among these are Zro Bank, Alterbank, and Rippio, which will allow users to connect these to bank accounts. The Visa executive did not comment on a possible ETA for these developments.

B2B Developments, Direct Bitcoin Payments, and NFTs

Visa revealed that they are also working on a B2B (business-to-business) oriented blockchain that will allow payment settlement among companies using smart contracts. Abreu stated that the system was already in testing phases with some of their customers, and that the company would have more announcements in this regard in the future. This system would enhance transparency in payments among providers and suppliers, allowing everyone with access to the system to verify payments and deposits.

Visa also stated they will start testing direct bitcoin payments in the country. This means that transactions will allow bitcoin to be transferred to other accounts directly. This is completely different than what happens now with most crypto cards, where there has to be an intermediary that exchanges bitcoin for fiat money on the fly.

The inclusion of direct bitcoin payments will facilitate the payment process and eliminate these intermediaries. In March, the CEO of Visa in Brazil stated it expects to implement this functionality sometime this year. Abreu stated there was also an NFT initiative in the works for Brazil. Visa has already jumped onto the NFT bandwagon by purchasing a Cryptopunk, a digital avatar on the Ethereum network, for $165K in ether, in August.

Highlights Cryptocurrency: Investors are treating them for long-time investment

Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency: Coin has earned a high mining rate since its inception

Cryptocurrency is barely a speculative investment these days. Retail and institutional investors are taking the digital assets very seriously. With so much going around the digital currency, investors are treating them as useful for not only short-term profits but also for long-time investment. But which ones should you choose to invest in? To make it easier for you, we discuss some crypto coins that have been topping the market cap charts time and again. Considering their relative stability, these could be good choices for a long-term investment. (Also Read: Meet ""The Jedi Master Of Crypto"": He Has Also Invested In Indian Start-Up)

Below are details about come cryptocurrencies:

1) Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency. Its valuation is increasing as more investors are endorsing this ‘digital gold'. The most vital factor behind its prized value is the maximum limit of its coins: 21 million.

2) Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum or ether is almost always in competition with Bitcoin, Ethereum or ether. Its share in the crypto market recently rose from 18 per cent to 20 per cent. It is a decentralised blockchain platform that cuts out third parties.

3) Cardano (ADA)

Cardano is also a decentralised blockchain platform that uses a native cryptocurrency. It enables secure peer-to-peer transactions. There are plans to enable smart contracts on it very soon.

4) Uniswap (UNI)

This currency already allows the use of smart contracts. It facilitates automated transactions with tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

5) Dogecoin (DOGE)

The coin has earned a high mining rate since its inception. It's still on the speculative stage and hasn't crossed the dollar mark. However, it has a larger circulation and unlimited capacity to mine more.

6) Binance Coin (BNB)

Like Bitcoin, it has a limit on the number of tokens that it circulates: 200 million coins. It also follows a quarterly routine of destroying or ""burning"" much of its currency around the year. These are major reasons for its soaring value.

7) Polkadot (DOT)

This currency provides a bridge for networks so that many applications built on Polkadot can also work on Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, it is more scalable and faster.

8) Tether (USDT)

It became one of the first cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. It is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency. The coins are backed up by fiat currencies kept in banks.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-02/kq34jumk_cryptocurrency-bitcoin-reuters_625x300_11_February_21.jpg',)",none

Highlights Simon Seojoon Kim started investing in Ether in 2015

By end of March 2017, Kim had put in close to $400,000

The 36-year-old entrepreneur is a software developer by trade

As Simon Seojoon Kim tells it, he started investing in Ether, the coin that fuels the Ethereum network, back in the year it started -- 2015. (Also Read: Which Is The Best Cryptocurrency For Long-Term Investment? Find Out)

His friends told him he was crazy as he ploughed a big part of his life savings into the new cryptocurrency. By the end of March 2017, he'd put in close to $400,000.

Then Ether began to climb.

While Kim's investments are hard to verify, one thing is beyond dispute: Ether has surged in value compared to the start of 2017. In the past year, it's up more than 10-fold. And Kim, meanwhile, has become one of South Korea's most famous blockchain advocates. After raising a first blockchain fund in December, he's planning a second one this month.

""He is like Yoda, the Jedi Master of cryptocurrency,"" said Sean Park, a senior partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group Inc. based in Hong Kong, who worked with Kim on a blockchain project.

Kim is a part of a burgeoning class of newly wealthy who made their money in virtual currencies. Bitcoin and Ether, the two largest tokens, continue to swing wildly, but both rose to records this year.

""The most successful investment is when you spot a fundamentally strong asset that's either not getting much attention or being viewed negatively,"" Kim said in an interview in Seoul, speaking about his early crypto bet.

The 36-year-old entrepreneur is a software developer by trade who has built and sold two companies. One was in education technology, while the other was a dating app.

In 2018, he co-founded Hashed, a kind of venture capital firm for blockchain projects. It takes stakes in companies and helps them to develop, including by arranging partnerships, providing financial advice and even helping with public relations.

Hashed raised $120 million in December for its first blockchain fund. Its backers included South Korean giants Naver Corp. and Kakao Corp., according to the companies' half-year business reports.

Now Hashed is planning to raise at least 200 billion won ($173 million) for a second fund this month, Kim said.

Hashed's investments typically range from $1 million to $10 million per company. It took part in a $7.5 million funding round in May for Vietnamese game-maker Sky Mavis, alongside billionaire Mark Cuban, following a seed round in 2019. It also invested $2.5 million in Loco, an India-based game streaming platform, Kim said.

But Hashed has attracted big players such as internet firm Naver, the third-largest company listed in South Korea by market value. Hashed has the most experience in the blockchain sector, according to Naver, which has so far disclosed investments of 14 billion won in Hashed's first fund.

""Our investors want to maximize their profit,"" Kim said. ""But they also want to learn about the market through us.""

Kim Kyonghwan, dean of the graduate school of entrepreneurship at Sungkyunkwan University in Suwon, a city near Seoul, sounds a note of caution.

""Given that the blockchain industry is new, unpredictability can be a short-term risk,"" he said. ""Still, I believe it's a market that will ultimately be institutionalized and grow.""

Kim said there's huge upside because the blockchain technology market is still in its infancy. But on crypto trading, he encourages people with no experience to be cautious about trying to make quick fortunes.

Sitting in a room named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Kim said he still has most of his Ether holdings. He said he's also a major investor in a token called Luna coin.

But when it comes to conventional investments like bonds and commodities, Kim prefers not to get involved. He even lives in a rented apartment with his wife rather than buying his own property, he said.

""Traditional assets are not in my interest,"" he said. ""They just seem too old and obsolete.""

Bitcoin trading over $52,000



Cryptocurrency prices continue to be in the green on September 7. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $2.37 trillion, a 1.12 percent increase over the last day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $139.49 billion, which makes a 17.85 percent increase. The volume of all stable coins is now $107.57 billion – 77.12 percent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.

(Image Solana.com)

Etherum competitor Solana — a decentralized blockchain platform – is now the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in the world ahead of Dogecoin. Its SOL token has jumped 3.3X in price in three weeks from $43 on August 15 to $145, at the time of filing of this report, as per CoinGecko. On the other hand, its market cap has grown from $14.6 billion to $42 billion in comparison to the $40.5 billion market cap of Dogecoin. Solana’s market cap is currently $21 billion short of the $63 billion market cap of XRP – the sixth largest cryptocurrency. However, according to expert, Solana’s speed to process transactions and lower cost is yet to be proven in the real world. According to its website, the average cost per transaction is $0.00025. “Solana is the fastest blockchain in the world and the fastest-growing ecosystem in crypto,” it said.

“We are in a bull market where the government is printing notes like paper. This is creating significant value to fixed supply assets like Bitcoin and Gold. But having this flood of new users joining the community is hunting for cryptos to get rich. Solana is an alternative to Ethereum with faster speed and lower costs. But it still has to prove in the real world. A sudden growth like this is a dangerous situation, but at the same time, it’s an opportunity for traders,” Kumar Gaurav, Founder & CEO, Cashaa told Financial Express Online.

Solana Labs, the developer of Solana blockchain had announced a $314 million funding round in June led by venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital. Alameda Research, Blockchange Ventures, CMS Holdings, others had also participated.

According to messari.io, Solana’s origin date back to 2017 when founder Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper draft about a new timekeeping technique for distributed systems called Proof of History (PoH). He believed that the technique can automate the transaction ordering process for blockchains as one of the limitations to scalability in Bitcoin and Ethereum is the time need to reach a consensus on the order of transactions. Its competitor Ethereum is currently the second-largest crypto after bitcoin with a market cap of $462 billion. It is currently trading at $3,940, according to CoinGecko.

Bitcoin, the world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency, scaled $50,940 (roughly Rs. 37.23 lakhs) on the day. On Monday (September 6) afternoon, the price of the cryptocurrency touched $51,809.55 (roughly Rs 37.87 lakh). This is the highest climb for the crypto token since May when it had started declining after reaching a record high of $65,000 (roughly Rs 47.51 lakh). Over the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has risen 8 percent.

Bitcoin's rise above $50,000 on Monday comes just a day ahead of El Salvador's plan to recognise the cryptocurrency as legal tender. In June, a proposal by the South American nation's President Nayib Bukele to embrace the cryptocurrency had received approval. The law will take effect tomorrow (September 7).

Before this, after consolidating for a few months since May on August 23, Bitcoin had touched $50,505 (roughly Rs. 36.91 lakhs). In the last couple of weeks, since August 23, Bitcoin had been trading between $46,500 and $50,000 (roughly Rs. 34 lakh to Rs. 37 lakh). Bitcoin price in India at 6pm on September 6 was around Rs. 39,60,000.

Ether, too, joins rally

On the back of Bitcoin's revival from its rout in May, Ether the crypto coin that had slumped along with a widespread cryptocurrency market crash in May also touched $4,000 (roughly Rs. 2.92 lakh) on Friday (September 3). This was the first time since May that Ether crossed the $4,000-mark. Ether's strong run began after its London upgrade last month. On Friday, the cryptocurrency traded at $4,025 (roughly Rs. 2.94 lakh). However, it slipped marginally on Monday, (September 6) trading at $3,944 (roughly Rs. 2.88 lakh). In the past 7 days, the digital asset has risen about 25 percent. Ethereum price in India at 6pm on September 6 was around Rs. 3,00,000.

What about other altcoins?

Alongside, Bitcoin and Ether, there are a few other altcoins, too, vying for their place in the limelight. Cardano, the number 3 coin in the world, has touched $2.91 (roughly Rs. 213). In the past 7 days, two other altcoins, Polkadot and Solana, have also risen by about 36 and 45 percent, respectively. At the time of writing, while Polkadot was trading at $35.01 (roughly Rs. 2,559), Solana was at $143.87 (roughly Rs. 10,516).

Will Bitcoin break the September jinx?

If you look at the history, September has not been favourable for Bitcoin's growth. In six of the past eight years, the cryptocurrency has had negative returns in this month. Will 2021 see a reversal in its fortune? Well, the month has just about begun, but one can only remain optimistic that the jinx will be broken this time round.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_disco_reuters_1622203490843.jpg',)",none

Solana's SOL token has tripled in about three weeks and now has a market value of more than $41 billion (roughly Rs. 2,99,640 crores), according to CoinGecko. Proponents tout the claimed speed and lower cost of transactions on Solana for decentralised finance and digital collectibles, applications where Ethereum dominates. Ether price in India stood at Rs. 2.97 lakhs as of 5:30pm IST on September 6.

“Solana has a growing ecosystem, projects are being built on it, and it's benefited hugely from the mania that's taking place in NFTs,” Antoni Trenchev, co-founder at crypto lender Nexo, wrote in an email. NFTs are non-fungible tokens used to trade digital collectibles. He said the backing of crypto figure Sam Bankman-Fried - chief executive of crypto exchange FTX - is helping.

Solana bills itself as the world's fastest blockchain and its website says the average cost per transaction is $0.00025 (roughly Rs. 0.018). In June it announced that it had raised $314 million (roughly Rs. 2,290 crores) in a funding round with investors including Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and CoinShares.

Late last month, Jump Trading-affiliated crypto market data provider Pyth Network went live on Solana's mainnet, a development that's expected to help bolster the world of decentralised finance. There are plans for it soon to be able to broadcast market data through the so-called Wormhole Network.

“It's becoming too big to ignore and offers a different smart contract solution to Ethereum,” Jonathan Cheesman, head of over-the-counter and institutional sales at FTX, wrote in an email.

So-called alternative coins like Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA, and Binance Coin have surged in recent weeks, taking some of the limelight from top tokens Bitcoin and Ether in a broad crypto revival from a May rout. Bitcoin has also rallied and came close to $52,000 (roughly Rs. 38 lakhs) on Monday. Cardano price in India stood at Rs. 216, Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 39.06 lakhs as of 5:30pm IST on September 6.

Skeptics argue the technological upgrades propelling some tokens may not justify the scale of the rallies.

The next session is at least two months away.But crypto exchanges have used the interim period to launch a massive lobbying initiative with several governments and regulatory agencies, raising concerns. The exchanges have argued that a ban on digital currency transactions will result in job losses.While there are fears that a ban will lead to investors getting locked into the instrument, sources indicated that a three-six month window will be provided for investors to exit.Several officials have junked the argument that crypto currencies are an asset class. Besides, there are worries over the legal basis for the presence of some of the exchanges, which remain outside the jurisdiction of either Sebi or the RBI. “There has to be global coordination to combat the challenge posed by cryptocurrencies.

, accounting and reporting standards and so on should be clarified. The cryptocurrency assets that were defined and classified by the government would only be allowed to trade in India. The crypto coins would then be taxed accordingly.



It has been suggested to apply a similar tax to the Security Transaction Tax (STT) in the coming times. It has also been said that these digital assets could also be entitled to income tax if they are indeed classified as commodities.



The income from the crypto trading could be taxed as business income in the hands of investors at normal rates of income tax.



With swift penetration and investment of over $6.6 billion in May 2021 in India’s crypto economy, it becomes all the more imperative now to have a well regulated mechanism. In light of this, the Economic Times reports that India’s upcoming cryptocurrency bill broadly aims to define and classify cryptocurrency assets in India. As per the report, currently the government is focussed on the end-use of the assets for regulatory purposes.In the report submitted by inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency, few of the provisions and suggestions laid down in the bill are:This would be the first time however that cryptocurrency would be defined and segmented on the basis of technology used. However, the working of the regulatory framework of cryptocurrency would become clearer and unambiguous to understand once the bill is approved and enacted. For instance, the manner in which assets will be taxed or regulated, or whether cryptocurrencies will be considered as commodities or currencies are yet not clear.Some big players in the crypto exchange have voiced optimism and hope for the new bill.

2021-09-05,Bitcoin News,JPMorgan Says Cryptocurrency Markets Are 'Looking Frothy' – Markets and Prices Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-cryptocurrency-markets-looking-frothy/,"JPMorgan Says Cryptocurrency Markets Are 'Looking Frothy'

Global investment bank JPMorgan says cryptocurrency markets are “looking frothy” as retail investors spill over from the stock market into cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Crypto Markets Look Frothy, According to JPMorgan

JPMorgan published a note Wednesday on the stock market and cryptocurrencies. It explains that retail investors bought stocks at a record pace over the summer with an estimated net flow into the U.S. stock market of $13 billion in August after reaching a record high of almost $16 billion in July.

The JPMorgan analysts asserted that the stock-buying frenzy spilled over into altcoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in August, and the surge in NFTs and decentralized finance (defi) activity has boosted the price of certain cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, solana, and cardano.

They wrote:

Cryptocurrency markets [are] looking frothy again.

As Bitcoin.com News reported, the crypto market gained approximately 83% in value over the last three months, led by altcoins. The global crypto market cap is currently $2.28 trillion. Bitcoin’s dominance slipped from 47% on Aug. 1 to 41.39% Saturday. Ethereum (ETH) currently represents 20.13% of the entire crypto market, followed by cardano (ADA) at 4.11%. Solana (SOL) represents 1.80%.

Solana has become one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies this year. At the price of $141.04 per coin, SOL is now the seventh-largest crypto by market capitalization. The coin gained 310.8% during the last month and 3,277.6% year-to-date.

The JPMorgan analysts noted that altcoin trading now represents about 33% of the crypto market, emphasizing that it was a big increase from the 22% reading in early August. They concluded:

The share of altcoins looks rather elevated by historical standards and in our opinion it is more likely to be a reflection of froth and retail investor ‘mania’ rather than a reflection of a structural uptrend.

The move is likely to benefit Indian cryptocurrency investors who have been waiting for a concrete law to regulate virtual coin trading.

Cryptocurrencies could be defined as commodities or assets in the new draft bill, reported The Economic Times after speaking to people aware of the development. The draft bill may also propose taxation for cryptocurrencies including laws for payments, investments and other utilities, added the report.

While the government had earlier said it would not go for an outright ban on cryptocurrencies, it has not yet provided any clarity on how it plans to deal with virtual coin trade in India.

However, cryptocurrencies may be categorised as per the technology they use in the new draft bill. But the primary focus of the government will be based on end-usage of the assets for regulatory purposes, according to the ET report.

TAX TREATMENT, OTHER RULES

The new draft bill is also expected to determine how taxes will be levied on cryptocurrency investments.

A person quoted in the ET report said the government’s draft crypto bill aims to define cryptocurrency and its treatment in various use cases. This will help authorities register cryptocurrency trade in the books of accounts and tax accordingly. However, the government may not be looking to allow payments and settlements through virtual currencies through its bill.

More clarity is needed on whether cryptocurrencies will be treated as commodities, services or similar to equities; only then can virtual coins be taxed or regulated. This is why the government’s primary goal is to define cryptocurrencies in its draft bill. Simply put, a clear definition of cryptocurrency is required to figure out how it will be regulated and taxed in future.

However, sources quoted in the ET report indicated that the government could apply something similar to security transaction tax (STT) on cryptocurrency trade. If they are categorised as commodities, the returns or gains made by investors could also be taxed as business income at normal income tax rates.

WHY CRYPTOCURRENCY BILL IS IMPORTANT

The development comes at a time when cryptocurrency trade is growing rapidly in the country. Domestic cryptocurrency exchanges have reported a sharp jump in trading volumes, and they have also requested the government to regulate virtual coin trade rather than imposing a ban.

Cryptocurrency exchanges in India have said numerous times that the country needs to recognise cryptocurrency tokens as digital assets rather than currencies, and subsequently, clarify policies related to crypto trade.

As of now, cryptocurrency does not have any legal status in India and are unregulated. The proposed crypto bill is likely to define the future of virtual coin trade in the country.

People in the know said only the cryptocurrencies that are covered under the government’s definition will be allowed to be traded in India.

2021-09-03,Times of India,What you must know about Cryptocurrencies and their role in global warming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/what-you-must-know-about-cryptocurrencies-and-their-role-in-global-warming/articleshow/85864130.cms,"Cryptocurrency Live Previous Next

NEW DELHI: Will cryptocurrencies wreck the global warming targets and trigger an environmental disaster? This question has become the topic of heated debates between cryptocurrency advocates and those who want them banned.The first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 consume ginormous amounts of electricity when they are mined. Mining is the process by which new Bitcoins enter circulation and the ledger of transactions is maintained and validated.It requires sophisticated and powerful computers to solve cryptographic puzzles and has been built around the “proof of work” principle.Mining has been getting progressively more difficult and expensive over time because of the way the first crypto currency, Bitcoin, and the others that followed initially, were created.But how much energy does cryptocurrency mining actually consume? Estimates vary. The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF) had estimated that currently Bitcoin mining consumes around 110 Terawatt Hours per year.Others have put it even higher – at around 155 TWh or so. To put that in perspective, it is around 0.55 percent of global electricity production, or equal to what a country like Malaysia consumes annually.And that is just for Bitcoin mining. Add the others and you are looking at an even higher energy footprint.Critics point out that the CO2 and heat generated by crypto currency mining is far more than any gains that one gets from emission reductions of electric vehicles (EV) being used around the world.Bitcoin mining and that of other similar cryptocurrencies were particularly bad for the environment until even a couple of years ago because the miners primarily used power from plants using coal.Many of the crypto currency mining hubs were in China, and while some of them used the cleaner hydro power, a number of miners depended on thermal power plants too. At one point, over 60 percent of Bitcoin mining was taking place in China.But over the past year, China has cracked down on miners and most miners have started moving out. Also, increasingly miners have been relying on green and renewable energy rather than thermal power.Most miners are working in areas where energy is generated using solar, wind, hydro and even flared natural gas of oil wells. While these do not cut out emissions altogether, there has been a concerted effort by the crypto currency champions to utilise energy that is both cheap and has a lower carbon footprint.Meanwhile, newer crypto currencies are ensuring that they either use less power for mining or use a different method of validation called “proof of stake”, which does not require using the kind of power that proof of work crypto currencies require.Even Ethereum, the second oldest and second most popular crypto currency is coming out with version 2.0, which will drastically cut down its carbon footprint.The worry for cryptocurrency miners is that increasingly, countries will regulate mining or ban it altogether in order to meet the emission goals agreed upon. This is why the search of solutions is going on frenetically.Multiple suggestions ranging from introducing a new cryptocurrency that will be given to anyone who can submit proof of removing each ton of CO2 or other greenhouse gases to the development of new eco-friendly crypto currencies to a blockchain-based platform to track carbon emissions and reduction of crypto currency usage.One solution – the Crypto Climate Accord -- envisages a pact that will see the shifting of all crypto currency activities to clean fuels and become net zero carbon emission by 2040. The problem is that while it has supporters, many of the older and more popular cryptocurrencies have yet to sign up for it.The issue is that using green energy for cryptocurrency mining alone doesn’t solve the entire problem. Even when clean energy or renewable energy like solar is used, the sheer power needed by the computers generates enormous heat.Crypto mining also adds to the pile of electronic waste that needs to be disposed of. And the fact that cryptocurrency mining becomes more difficult and requires more computing power every year creates its own set of environmental hazards.Crypto advocates suggest that eventually a solution acceptable to all will be found. Apart from transiting to green energy, crypto miners will also play a role in grid balancing and flexible demand-response services.Over the next few years, we will know whether that works out as well as they expect. Meanwhile, environmental scientists plan to keep a close watch on the crypto mining industry.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85864245,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50952,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-09-03,News.com.au,"Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin soar in Australia",https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/experts-predict-cryptocurrency-will-dominate-financial-industry-by-2029/news-story/68340bb221ed9cbbb6e76507e3d6d521,"A report has revealed why cryptocurrency purchases are soaring among a particular generation of Australians, fuelling a bold prediction.

Cryptocurrency experts believe it will surpass traditional finance in Australia as early as 2029 after a new report revealed the country had accumulated $7bn worth of digital coins.

Comparison site Finder has released its annual Cryptocurrency Report with some significant revelations, including that 31 per cent of Gen Z Australians (born after 1997) own some form of crypto.

Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital forms of money that take on the form of tokens or “coins” using cryptography, making it difficult to be counterfeited.

Australians have amassed $7bn worth of cryptocurrency, with the average investor owning $2078 in assets.

Overall, 17 per cent of Australians own cryptocurrency, while a further 13 per cent said they intended to buy it within the next year.

A nationally representative Finder survey also found 56 per cent of Australians believed tech billionaire Elon Musk invented Bitcoin.

Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, owned by 9 per cent of Australian crypto investors, followed by Ethereum (8 per cent), Dogecoin (5 per cent) and Bitcoin Cash (4 per cent).

The biggest revelation out of Finder’s report is that almost 31 per cent of Gen Z Australians (aged 24 and under) own cryptocurrency, and that figure has more than doubled since January.

But ownership of digital coins has dropped in other generations.

Finder’s cryptocurrency expert James Edwards said Gen Z’s behaviour was a sign traditional finance was being phased out in a bold prediction for its future.

“Many Aussies are now much more clear on the benefits cryptocurrencies offer, such as Bitcoin being a hedge against fiat currency and inflation, plus the ability to earn interest on assets through things like stablecoins and decentralised finance on Ethereum,” he said.

Fred Schebesta says the growth in cryptocurrency will explode.

“If the pace of education continues to grow, combined with easier access to cryptocurrencies, we should expect to see it as a dominant financial industry by the end of the decade, especially among younger generations who have never had meaningful access to traditional finance.”

Finder founder Fred Schebesta also predicted digital coins were about to explode.

“As the technology develops and there are easier ways to access it – like in the Finder app where you can buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in a few clicks – I believe the growth in cryptocurrency will explode,” he said.

The report emphasised social media will underpin the growth of cryptocurrencies.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/80971fc577bc8a4140540022df38d45e',)",none

NEW DELHI: World’s second largest cryptocurrency network by way of market capitalization, Ethereum , split into two chains or versions.The split happened due to the failure of the older Go Ethereum (Geth) nodes to upgrade to ‘Hades Gamma' patch. The patch was released on 24th August after a bug was detected in mid-August 2020 in the 1.10.7 version of Ethereum network Go Ethereum updated its users on Twitter on August 27 about the split and the complete resolution of security vulnerability with its 1.10.8 version. It asked users to update their nodes having Hades Gamma patch to the current version if they haven't done so already.Geth is a command line interface for running Ethereum nodes implemented in Go language. Geth helps the users to join Ethereum network, transfer amounts between accounts, and mine ether.Information on the blockchain is stored on the network in chains of transactions.As they become verified, each transaction is added to the digital ledger.In the case of a split in the chain, all the transactions will not be verified by all the nodes. The split is a cause of concern for Ethereum investors or Ethereum-based applications.It increases the chances of double spend,where a single transaction is registered more than once thus allowing users to misrepresent their amount in the wallet.Almost 38 per cent of Ethereum Network nodes were using older Geth versions. Andre Cronje, the founder of Yearn Finance told users to stop doing transactions until the issue is fixed or if the users have updated to the latest Geth version.Impact of the split will likely be less, as more nodes are updating to Geth 1.10.8 version on an ongoing basis.The security lead for Ethereum Foundation , Martin Swende said, informing about the forking,that most miners were updated and fortunately the latest version is the longest node.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85833686,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-38990,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Trump. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images

Cryptocurrencies are a disaster waiting to happen, Donald Trump told Fox Business on Tuesday.

Trump said he isn't a big fan of digital currencies because they're hurting the dollar.

""They certainly are something that people don't know very much about,"" he said.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Donald Trump described cryptocurrencies as a disaster waiting to happen, and lashed out at them for hurting the dollar.

""I like the currency of the United States,"" the former US president told Fox Business' Stuart Varney when asked his thoughts on crypto. ""I think the others are potentially a disaster waiting to happen.""

Trump cast doubt on digital assets, and said people in the US ""should be invested in our currency.""

""They may be fake. Who knows what they are?"" he said in the Tuesday interview. ""They certainly are something that people don't know very much about. I have not been a big fan.""

Bitcoin proponents among others have suggested cryptocurrencies could pose a threat to the US dollar as a reserve currency and through their use in transactions, such as for trade, and in remittances.

This wasn't the first time Trump has publicly blasted cryptocurrencies. He told Fox's Varney in June that bitcoin seems like a scam and suggested the asset should be more regulated.

Bitcoin's price has fallen 25% from its record high above $64,000 to about $47,500 as of Wednesday. Still, it is up 64% so far this year. In comparison, the dollar index is little changed.

US regulators and lawmakers have stepped up their attention on cryptocurrencies in recent months, as the highly volatile assets grow in popularity among retail investors.

Before Twitter permanently suspended Trump's account, he criticized cryptocurrencies on a thread in 2019. ""I'm not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,"" he said at the time.

Although the former president isn't big on crypto, he has a group of supporters who launched a digital token as a reaction to his loss in the November 2020 election. Magacoin, the pro-Trump cryptocurrency, has received over 1,000 sign-ups since its launch, as of July.

President Joe Biden's administration has acknowledged the crypto boom, by contrast to Trump. Gary Gensler, Biden's appointment to chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has said cryptocurrency trading platforms have become so large that they need to embrace regulation or risk losing public trust.

""There are a lot of platforms that are in operation today that would do better engaging and instead there is a bit of...?begging for forgiveness, rather than asking for permission,"" Gensler said in a Financial Times interview published Wednesday.

2021-09-02,TechCrunch,Offchain Labs raises $120 million to fix Ethereum’s shortcomings with its Arbitrum product – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/offchain-labs-raises-120-million-to-hide-ethereums-shortcomings-with-arbitrum-scaling-product/,"As the broader crypto world enjoys a late summer surge in enthusiasm, more and more blockchain developers who have taken the plunge are bumping into the blaring scaling issues faced by decentralized apps on the Ethereum blockchain. The network has seen its popularity explode in the past year, but its transaction volume has stayed frustratingly stable as the network continues to operate near its limits, leading to slower transaction speeds and hefty fees on the crowded chain.

Ethereum’s core developers have been planning significant upgrades to the blockchain to rectify these issues, but even in the crypto world’s early stages, transitioning the network is a daunting, lengthy task. That’s why developers are looking to so-called Layer 2 rollup scaling solutions, which sit on top of the Ethereum network and handle transactions separately in a cheaper, faster way, while still recording the transactions to the Ethereum blockchain, albeit in batches.

The Layer 2 landscape is early, but crucial to the continued scalability of Ethereum. As a result, there’s been quite a bit of passionate chatter among blockchain developers regarding the early players in the space. Offchain Labs has been developing one particularly hyped rollup network called Arbitrum One, which has built up notable support and momentum since it beta-launched to developers in May, with about 350 teams signing up for access, the company says.

They’ve attracted some high-profile partnerships, including Uniswap and Chainlink, which have promised early support for the solution. The company has also quickly piqued investor interest. The startup tells TechCrunch it raised a $20 million Series A in April of this year, quickly followed up by a $100 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, which closed this month and valued the company at $1.2 billion. Other new investors include Polychain Capital, Ribbit Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Pantera Capital, Alameda Research and Mark Cuban.

It’s been a fairly lengthy ride for the Arbitrum technology to public access. The tech was first developed at Princeton — you can find a YouTube video where the tech is first discussed in earnest back in early 2015. Longtime professor Ed Felten and his co-founders CEO Steven Goldfeder and CTO Harry Kalodner detailed a deeper underlying vision in a 2018 research paper before licensing the tech from Princeton and building out the company. Felten previously served as the deputy U.S. chief technology officer in the Obama White House, and — alongside Goldfeder — authored a top textbook on cryptocurrencies.

After a lengthy period under wraps and a few months of limited access, the startup is ready to publicly launch the Arbitrum One mainnet, they tell TechCrunch.

This team’s scaling solution has few direct competitors — a16z-backed Optimism is its most notable rival — but Arbitrum’s biggest advantage is likely the smooth compatibility it boasts with decentralized applications designed to run on Ethereum, compared with competitors that may require more heavy-lifting on the developer’s part to be fully compatible with their rollup solution. That selling point could be a big one as Arbitrum looks to court support across the Ethereum network and crypto exchanges for its product, though most Ethereum developers are well aware of what’s at stake broadly.

“There’s just so much more demand than there is supply on Ethereum,” Goldfeder tells TechCrunch. “Rollups give you the security derived from Ethereum but a much better experience in terms of costs.”","('https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-from-iOS-5.jpg?w=533',)",none

Trump. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images

Cryptocurrencies are a disaster waiting to happen, Donald Trump told Fox Business on Tuesday.

Trump said he isn't a big fan of digital currencies because they're hurting the dollar.

""They certainly are something that people don't know very much about,"" he said.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Donald Trump described cryptocurrencies as a disaster waiting to happen, and lashed out at them for hurting the dollar.

""I like the currency of the United States,"" the former US president told Fox Business' Stuart Varney when asked his thoughts on crypto. ""I think the others are potentially a disaster waiting to happen.""

Trump cast doubt on digital assets, and said people in the US ""should be invested in our currency.""

""They may be fake. Who knows what they are?"" he said in the Tuesday interview. ""They certainly are something that people don't know very much about. I have not been a big fan.""

Bitcoin proponents among others have suggested cryptocurrencies could pose a threat to the US dollar as a reserve currency and through their use in transactions, such as for trade, and in remittances.

This wasn't the first time Trump has publicly blasted cryptocurrencies. He told Fox's Varney in June that bitcoin seems like a scam and suggested the asset should be more regulated.

Bitcoin's price has fallen 25% from its record high above $64,000 to about $47,500 as of Wednesday. Still, it is up 64% so far this year. In comparison, the dollar index is little changed.

US regulators and lawmakers have stepped up their attention on cryptocurrencies in recent months, as the highly volatile assets grow in popularity among retail investors.

Before Twitter permanently suspended Trump's account, he criticized cryptocurrencies on a thread in 2019. ""I'm not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,"" he said at the time.

Although the former president isn't big on crypto, he has a group of supporters who launched a digital token as a reaction to his loss in the November 2020 election. Magacoin, the pro-Trump cryptocurrency, has received over 1,000 sign-ups since its launch, as of July.

President Joe Biden's administration has acknowledged the crypto boom, by contrast to Trump. Gary Gensler, Biden's appointment to chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has said cryptocurrency trading platforms have become so large that they need to embrace regulation or risk losing public trust.

""There are a lot of platforms that are in operation today that would do better engaging and instead there is a bit of...?begging for forgiveness, rather than asking for permission,"" Gensler said in a Financial Times interview published Wednesday.

2021-09-02,Forbes,Solana Skyrockets To New High—Amassing Nearly $40 Billion In Market Value As Competition With Ethereum Heats Up,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/08/31/solana-skyrockets-to-new-high-above-130-amassing-nearly-40-billion-in-market-value-as-competition-with-ethereum-heats-up/,"Topline

Though the broader cryptocurrency market was virtually flat Tuesday, nascent token Solana tacked on to an explosive rally, hitting a new all-time high above $130 thanks to growing investor fervor around the Ethereum competitor's platform, which also supports the smart contracts necessary for booming decentralized finance applications and non-fungible tokens.

Now the world’s eighth-largest cryptocurrency, Solana has soared nearly 220% over the past month. getty

Key Facts

The price of Solana soared nearly 30% to a high of $130.01 on Tuesday morning, lifting its seven-day gains to more than 67% and giving the token, which debuted only 18 months ago, a market capitalization of about $38 billion. “Popular altcoin Solana has reaffirmed its status as an outlier in the market,” Jonas Luethy, a trader at London-based cryptocurrency broker GlobalBlock, wrote in a Monday email, noting Solana was by far the best-performing top-ten cryptocurrency over the past week. Now the world’s eighth-largest cryptocurrency, Solana skyrocketed 10% Monday and has climbed a staggering 6,800% this year alone—eclipsing the gains of other top cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether and Cardano’s ada—up 63%, 372% and 1,160%, respectively. Luethy pointed to the booming popularity of NFTs, the blockchain-based digital art collectibles increasingly gaining traction among celebrities, as the catalyst behind Solana’s rally. According to Luethy, NFT sales in August have already hit a record of about $900 million, more than triple their previous best month in May. Over the weekend, Solana hit another milestone: The value of decentralized finance projects—which have caught the eye of regulators—pinned to the token’s blockchain surpassed $3 billion for the first time ever, nearly tripling this month alone.

Tangent

In a report on Monday, crypto investment firm CoinShares revealed investors have increasingly been selling off bitcoin funds, in favor of investments tied to other cryptocurrencies. For the first time ever, Solana funds led investment growth earlier this month, tacking on more than $7 million in the week ending August 20, compared to $3.2 million for Ethereum and a loss of $2.8 million for Bitcoin. Investment strategist James Butterfill noted Solano’s more flexible software and faster transaction speed, compared to larger rival Ethereum, has helped it gain traction among investors and software developers.

Key Background

Solana’s stunning rally this past week has headlined growth among a slew of so-called altcoins, or cryptocurrency alternatives to market leaders bitcoin and ether. Solana’s support for smart contracts has helped it take advantage of the buzz around NFTs and DeFi, but other players have signaled plans to dive into the space as well, with Cardano, for example, planning to launch a software upgrade next month in order to begin processing smart contracts.

What To Watch For

Regulation. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler hasn’t been too keen on the growing popularity of DeFi, saying at a conference last month that the sector isn't immune to regulation. Last week, the agency signed a six-figure deal with blockchain analytics firm AnChain.AI to help it investigate DeFi transactions. “The SEC is very keen on understanding what is happening in the world of smart contract-based digital assets,” AnChain CEO and cofounder Victor Fang told Forbes.

Surprising Fact

Though its price has soared 255% over the past month, Solana plunged nearly 60% this summer as the broader cryptocurrency market crashed amid intensifying regulations in China.

""We started because we wanted to learn something new about technology – and also make some money along the way,"" Ishaan tells CNBC Make It. And they have. Each month, the siblings make over $30,000 mining three digital coins: Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value; ether, the second-largest; and ravencoin, an altcoin amid the top 100, Ishaan says. To do this, Ishaan and Aanya, who are based in Frisco, Texas, had to learn how to mine, which is no simple feat. When mining to earn cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, complex computers are programmed to compete to solve difficult puzzles in order to validate transactions. ""Crypto mining is just like mining for gold or diamonds,"" Ishaan says. ""Instead of using shovels, you mine with computers. Instead of finding a piece of gold or a diamond in the mine, you find a cryptocurrency."" After watching videos on YouTube and searching the internet, Ishaan converted his Alienware, a popular kind of gaming computer, into an ether mining rig in April. (He did this by using the graphics card, which can perform a high volume of calculations for mining.) His parents were supportive: ""We could have spent the entire summer playing video games, but instead we used our spare time to learn about technology,"" Ishaan says.

The siblings began with ether, because mining bitcoin can be especially difficult. With its limited supply and surging demand, the competition when mining bitcoin can be more intense. On their first day, ""I made $3,"" Ishaan says. To make business official, Ishaan and Aanya created their own mining company, Flifer Technologies, with the help of their father, Manish Raj, on April 30. ""We liked it so much that we started to add more processors [or chips], and made $1,000 in our first month"" of May, Ishaan says. The siblings' income continued to rise, and by late July, they could afford to buy equipment, like Antminers and Nvidia RTX 3080-Ti graphics cards, to start mining bitcoin and ravencoin, too. When deciding which to mine, they chose ravencoin because the equipment they had was ""optimal"" for mining it, Raj says. In total, they expect to earn around $36,000 in September based on the equipment currently on order, Raj says.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106935127-1630353086740-IMG-1023.jpg?v=1630353228',)",none

As for the past year, Solana has surged over 2,348%.

But just what is Solana and why is it on fire right now? Here’s what you need to know.

What is Solana? Solana is a decentralized blockchain platform. It facilitates the transactions of the SOL coin as well as digital assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Solana is a decentralized blockchain platform. It facilitates the transactions of the SOL coin as well as digital assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Is Solana a bitcoin competitor? Sure, because it’s another cryptocurrency. But it’s more apt to liken Solana to Ethereum since both are blockchain platforms that handle smart contracts.

At eighth place, Solana falls just behind Dogecoin, which is worth $36 billion. Why is Solana surging? This is always a hard question to answer. Though Solana is holding some kind of mysterious “Ignition” event today. Nasdaq notes that some industry watchers have speculated that Solana might announce that it will “burn” tokens. That’s when a certain number of coins are removed from supply, making the remaining ones more scarce and thus more valuable. Alternately, Solana could be set to announce new smart contract features.

Update: Solana has announced the Ignition event is an upcoming virtual hackathon with up to $5 million in seed funding and prizes.","('https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2021/08/P-1-90671003-solana-cryptocurrency-heres-why-the-ethereum-competitor-is-surging.jpg',)",none
2021-09-02,HT Tech,Ethereum Weathers Bug That Underlines Possible Blockchain Risks,https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/ethereum-weathers-bug-that-underlines-possible-blockchain-risks-71630404710548.html,"Ethereum has weathered a bug that split the world’s most-used blockchain and opened up the risk of counterfeit Ether tokens.

Outdated software last week caused the fork in the digital ledger, which is popular for blockchain-based financial services and transactions in online collectibles. Users minimized the damage by rapidly updating a key program and the deviant fork should wither, said Joseph Lubin, founder and CEO of Consensys Systems, and a co-founder of Ethereum.

“This chain fork opened up a single minor vulnerability: a greater likelihood of perpetrating a double-spend and getting the money out of the system before it is corrected naturally by the protocol,” Lubin said in an email Sunday. He said there had been an attempt to exploit the bug, but added that the issue is rapidly being solved by people making the needed updates.

The episode is the latest to highlight potential weaknesses in cryptocurrencies. Just this month PolyNetwork was subject to a $610 million hack that was likely the biggest ever in DeFi, although it said it recovered all the funds. Japanese crypto exchange Liquid also suffered a hack estimated to be around $90 million, and Bitcoin SV faced a so-called 51% attack on its blockchain.

One coder for the software at the center of the Ethereum bug said that at one point it was a “really close shave.”

Ether rose to back above $3,200 in Asia on Monday and was trading at around $3,165 at 2:10 pm Hong Kong time. It slid while the bug fix was taking place, dropping from around $3,341 on Aug. 23 to as low as $3,056 on Aug. 26.

More than half of Ethereum nodes may have been running with the bug at one point, according to a report from The Block on Friday. The Block Research also identified an address that exploited the bug. Several pools, including Binance, appeared to have been mining on the wrong version, according to a tweet Friday from Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko.

“This just underlines how all major public blockchains are non-linear, meaning they are run by an open-source community that needs to be majority aligned in principle and technically to ensure seamless chain performance,” said Konstantin Richter, founder and chief executive officer of Blockdaemon, in an email Saturday. “Since there isn’t a central entity, these things happen and are the price of decentralization.”","('https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2021/08/31/1600x900/2020-11-23T140031Z_977600602_RC229K9GLVG6_RTRMADP_3_CRYPTO-CURRENCIES_1607177306565_1607177319803_1630404742460.JPG',)",none

2021-09-02,Analytics Insight,Top Profitable Cryptocurrencies to Buy in September 2021,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-profitable-cryptocurrencies-to-buy-in-september-2021/,"Top Profitable Cryptocurrencies to Buy in September 2021

These cryptocurrencies show promising growth and high returns in the long run.

Cryptocurrencies are growing to become stronger investment options as months go by. In August, Bitcoin reached closer to its all-time high of US$60,000 by reaching US$50,000. Keeping an eye on the crypto trends and headlines, the bullish run is giving several traders the confidence to buy more cryptocurrencies. For that, Analytics Insight has made this of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this weekend.

1. Bitcoin

The first half of 2021 saw the crypto market crash and Bitcoin becoming half of its all-time high to US$30,000. In August, the price bounced back and now Bitcoin is trading at the value of US$47,000. This price drop is a good sign for new crypto investors who want to buy Bitcoins and reap the profits.

2. Ethereum

Next to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency. Its blockchain network revolutionized the DeFi sector and made way for decentralized apps. Recently, Ethereum launched its much-awaited new update that will improve the transaction fees and reduce Ether’s inflation. This change makes it easy for investors to decipher the value of investing in Ether and give miners a fair fee.

3. XRP

XRP is one of the most popular utility tokens in the market. Created by Ripple, XRP’s blockchain platform aims to set up cross-border currencies without any friction. Since its launch, many banks have realized the capabilities of this token and the volume of transactions on this network has increased since then. One of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to buy, XRP has a bright future in the crypto market.

4. Tether

As a stable coin, Tether is unlike most cryptocurrencies in the market. A stable coin is a digital token that has a fixed value and is pegged to a fiat currency, like the Euro or the Dollar. Similarly, Tether has a fixed value of US$1 or equivalent and maintains US$1 in reserve for each Tether issued.

5. USD Coin

USD Coin is a more popular stable coin as its value is only pegged to the US dollar. Stable coins withstand market volatility better and offer a more risk-free investment option. This is apt for new investors who want to make their first move in the market.

6. Cardano

Cardano is known for its proof-of-stake network. Its open blockchain platform is open-source and decentralized. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its native token, Ada. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies to invest in.

7. Dogecoin

Dogecoin, originally made as a meme, has become a legit cryptocurrency with high potential. It has made enough headlines, thanks to Elon Musk’s obsession with making cryptocurrencies trending. All the hype played in favor of this coin and its value that grew more than 50% since its inception. It’s also one of the cheapest cryptocurrencies to invest in.

8. Binance Coin

Binance Coin is a token native to the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. As long as there is activity on the Binance exchange, Binance coin will continue to steadily grow. Ranked among the top six cryptocurrencies in the world, Binance coin can be used to trade other cryptocurrencies as well.

9. Litecoin

Litecoin is a rival for Bitcoin’s blockchain network. Litecoin aims to pay for everyday goods and services with transactions faster than Bitcoin. Litecoin has been recognized for its practical purpose by market experts and trade merchants. This means Litecoin is a crypto that can suddenly take on a bull run.

10. NEO

Similar to Ethereum, NEO is a platform for smart contracts. Launched in 2014, NEO’s mission is to improve Ethereum’s network by offering the same utility functions via a more sophisticated blockchain. While NEOs network is superior to Ethereum, it will only reach its full potential in a couple of years. The wait will be worth it for investors.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Top-Profitable-Cryptocurrencies-to-Buy-in-September.jpg',)",none

And in latest twist and turns, billionaire hedge fund manager, John Paulson said that there is no intrinsic value attached with cryptocurrencies except for a “limited amount.” He said that the entire segment is “too volatile"" and that Bitcoin went from US$5,000 to US$45,000 within a short period. “Cryptocurrencies, regardless of where they’re trading today, will eventually prove to be worthless. Once the exuberance wears off, or liquidity dries up, they will go to zero. I wouldn’t recommend anyone invest in cryptocurrencies,"" Paulson said. However, yesterday Raghuram Rajan, former RBI governor,said, “Crypto currencies, which are yet to gain the status of legal tender in most parts of the world, have a “potential future"" if they are well regulated.

“We saw Bitcoin oscillating between $47,500 and making a dash towards $49,000 over the past 24 hours. Currently, the important support level for BTC is at $46,230, and a strong resistance level is at $50,000. Crypto-analytics platform, Santiment, stated that the markets are poised for a bounce after the recent rejection at $50,000, as several traders are getting impatient. Markets, however, had other plans altogether. The new week began with most of the cryptocurrencies falling. Solana (SOL) was the only exception, as it rose by approximately 7.5%. We saw the total market cap declining by almost 2.83%. The trade volumes went down by 7%. Traders are currently looking at the market for directional cues and therefore are refraining from making aggressive trades. We could likely witness Bitcoin making a move towards the $50,000 mark this week,” Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder, Mudrex- A Global Crypto Trading Platform said.

2021-09-02,News.com.au,What are solana and fantom as the cryptocurrencies’ prices surge,https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/what-are-solana-and-fantom-as-the-cryptocurrencies-prices-surge/news-story/5b16dd0725d57cd76480c3925dbd95d8,"Two new cryptocurrencies, called solana and fantom, have recorded huge spikes in price. Find out about the new rivals to bitcoin.

Two new cryptos are making waves with solana hitting an all time market value high of $US30 billion ($A41 billion), while fantom exploded in value to $US600 million ($A822 million).

Both relatively new entrants are considered strong competitors against one of the most popular cryptos, ethereum, as well as bitcoin.

Solana prices spiked by 12 per cent on Monday reaching a price of $US103.72 ($A142.22), while fantom soared by 70 per cent in just one day to trade at $US0.87 ($A1.19).

Here’s more on the new cryptos.

When did solana and fantom debut?

Solana only launched 18 months ago, but is now the world’s eighth largest cryptocurrency with a market value of around $US30 billion ($A41 billion). Its price has risen by 37 per cent in the last week alone and this year its shot up by a massive 70 per cent.

Fantom has grown by more than 340 per cent in the last 30 days. It could be heading back up to its all-time high price of $US0.94 ($A1.29), which it hit back in May before the crypto market crash.

It went live at December 2019, but most of its core features weren’t introduced until the end of last year.

Who are behind the cryptos?

Solana’s most prominent founder is a former software engineer for Dropbox named Anatoly Yakovenko.

One of his big aims was to differentiate the coin by a proof of history feature, meaning it can record transactions and the time that has passed between them, boosting the trust in the blockchain story.

He helped solana raise $US25 million in public and private funding rounds back in 2017 to fund the digital coin.

Fantom was founded in early 2018 by South Korean man Ahn Byung Ik, who has a PhD in computer science and has already led several successful start-ups. There are reports he is no longer associated with the crypto, due to strict regulations in South Korea.

The idea behind fantom was to create a crypto that would be suitable for smart cities with the ambitious goal of offering a processing speed of 300,000 transactions per second.

How many coins are in circulation?

For solana, there’s a total of 489 million coins planned for release, with around 260 million already in the market.

But 60 per cent of these coins are controlled by the project’s founders and its foundation, with only 38 per cent reserved for the community.

There are currently 2.5 billion fantom coins circulating out of a maximum supply of 3.1 billion.

What are the price changes this year?

Solana has had an impressive rise starting the year trading at less than $US1.85 ($A2.54), but now jumped past the $US100 ($A137) mark. It means solana has posted more than a 3600 per cent gain this year alone.

Fantom hit a low of $US0.15 ($A0.21) on July 20, but it rocketed 500 per cent to $US0.90 ($A1.23) on Monday as its 24-hour trading volume exploded by 1250 per cent to a record $US1.26 billion ($A1.73 billion).

Why the huge spikes in value?

Prices have spiked because of the use of technology called smart contract blockchains and the projects it can host, alongside offering bank-grade security.

Basically people can use the tech on projects such as decentralised finance and trading, lending and digital collectibles like NFTs.

Jonas Luethy, a trader at London-based cryptocurrency broker GlobalBlock, said the booming popularity of NFTs, which are starting to catch the eye of celebrities, was the catalyst behind solana’s rally.

He said NFT sales in August hit a record of about $US900 million ($A1.23 billion).

For fantom, there are reports it hosts 200,000 daily transactions and has over 77,000 digital wallets on the platform.

What’s driving solana’s worth?

Solana’s decentralised finance projects have also tripled in value in August alone, surpassing $US3 billion ($A4.1 billion) for the first time ever.

The digital coin is also said to be a threat to ethereum as its tech is more flexible, cheaper and offers faster transaction speeds. On its website, it boasts it can process 50,000 transactions per second through its tech.

Over the past week, solana has also picked up more than $US7 million ($A9.6 million) in net investment, according to crypto investment firm CoinShares, compared to a loss of $US2.8 million ($A3.8 million) for bitcoin.

Experts noted that solana was the only cryptocurrency in the top 10 rising in value over the past 24 hours

What about China’s influence on crypto?

While solana’s price skyrocketed nearly 220 per cent over the past month, it took a dive of nearly 60 per cent amid the crypto market crash due to regulations in China.

The US regulator is also investigating the cryptocurrency market and the tech behind it, which could be a threat to their growing popularity.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/808ca1864fa81f99eb9c23ec082cb77f',)",none
2021-09-02,,Payments: Kerala firm opts for cryptocurrency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/payments-kerala-firm-opts-for-cryptocurrency/articleshow/85780181.cms,"Kochi: Athey Nallatha , a Kerala startup that sells fusion pickles to the domestic as well as a global clientele, becomes the first company in Kerala which is ready to accept cryptocurrency for its payments. It is also the seventh firm in India to enter into cryptocurrency-based transactions, the startup claimed.On Aug 28, 2021, the startup opened its payment gateway by CoinBase to customers. Digital currencies accepted on this portal are Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, DAI, and USDC, though a transaction is yet to happen.When questioned why they included cryptocurrency as a mode of payment, apart from cards, UPI and Google Pay, while it is yet to gain popularity in the country, Akshay Raveendran, co-founder and director, Athey Nallatha said, “The promoters have been involved with cryptocurrency right from the inception itself – we used to keep track and invest in them. Also, if we implement blockchain technology on the operations side, it is going to save us a lot of money and customers are also going to benefit from this. There are major scaling plans but as a starting step, we have done this.”Interestingly, the startup doesn’t accept cash due to the pandemic. Founded in June 2020, during the pandemic, by two management graduates Hafez Rahman and Akshay Raveendran, Athey Nallatha also aims at providing employment opportunities to mothers.“We source vegetables and meat products from local farmers in and around Kochi. And during the initial days of the pandemic, we couldn’t group the people to work together at a single place to process these raw materials. Hence, we distributed the jobs between various groups of women. While one group took care of vegetable peeling, another took care of cleaning fish. Finally, we collected the products and brought them to a centralized kitchen where it was prepared,” Raveendran said.At present, Athey Nallatha employs 70 women from Panangad, Paravur or Tripunithura – places in and around Kochi. And a number of farmers around Kochi benefitted from local sourcing. “We wanted to stimulate the local economy. During the initial days of Covid, the inter-state trade was disrupted and farmers were affected. So, we decided to source locally only,” said Raveendran.Athey Nallatha sells its products online through its website and Amazon. It also sells them via 30 retail stores. For serving the Middle Eastern clientele, the startup is tying up with online portal Noon.com. Raveendran said he got the first direct order from Germany and the shipments are going soon.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-09-02,Business Standard,Hottest cryptocurrencies are alternatives to Bitcoin and Ether,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/hottest-cryptocurrencies-are-alternatives-to-bitcoin-and-ether-121083100046_1.html,"FOMO remains alive and well in the cryptocurrency world, with lesser-known tokens outperforming again in the wake of recent rallies staged by industry leaders and Ether.



Cardano has doubled this month, becoming the third-largest digital asset. Binance Coin is also up. A token named Avalanche has tripled in August. Meanwhile, prices for digital photos of rocks with laser eyes and cartoon depictions of cute animals are going gangbusters, sometimes quadrupling in a matter of days.

Among analysts and investors, there’s little consensus as to what’s driving parts of the frenzy. Some posit that speculators are moving from the mainstays to newer, more exciting offshoots, as they often do after big runs. Others see a world awash in cash and ultra-low rates, which ultimately pushes investors toward ever-wonkier assets. A few tokens are backed by strong narratives, such as technological advances at the Cardano and Solana networks.

“There’s no doubt that there’s a lot of excitement in crypto,” said Yoni Assia, founder and chief executive of online exchange eToro. “You can definitely see it within the numbers in the industry, whether it’s looking at total volumes or looking at growth of companies,” he said, adding that “we’ve seen a lot of exuberance in the market.”





Assia calls it a “generational buying moment” and cites a confluence of events, including rock-bottom interest rates worldwide, as well as massive fiscal stimulus efforts that delivered checks to many people during the pandemic.

Some of that money has gone toward and related assets, such as stocks of digital miners. About 15% of Americans who received the first two stimulus checks invested part or all of the money, and about half of this group invested specifically in cryptocurrencies, according to a survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults conducted by The Harris Poll for Yahoo Finance.

At the same time, inflation has materialized as economies reopen, playing into the warnings from some crypto faithful of pending hyperinflation. Put all that together and it’s “leading a lot of people to look for various types of investments,” Assia said.

A recent survey by eToro found that roughly a quarter of the 6,000 investors queried own crypto, a number that increases to nearly 50% for the younger cohort. The company also found that the average investor was set to increase their crypto allocation in the coming months and that interest in alternatives to and Ether, or altcoins, is “significant.”

Meanwhile, downloads for crypto trading apps are rising -- Coinbase Global Inc. ranked 11th among finance apps in Apple’s iPhone downloads, according to App Annie, a mobile data and analytics provider. It averaged 23rd within its category last August. Digital exchanges Kraken, Voyager and Crypto.com have also advanced in the ranks.





“With all of this money floating around, we should not be surprised that there are people paying exorbitant amounts of money for digital pet rocks and an endless amount of other digital assets that can be easily created,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.

The space is dominated by younger generations, he said, and all they know is a Federal Reserve that’s been almost-perpetually accommodative. Take that, alongside a gridlocked government, and it’s no surprise many have gravitated toward the crypto space, he said.

Since July, assets under management for digital-asset investment products rose more than 57% to roughly $55 billion. Average daily aggregate trading volumes increased more than 46% to $544 million, the biggest month-over-month rise since May, according to data-tracker CryptoCompare.

A lot of the attention’s been placed on altcoins such as Cardano, Avalanche and the meme mainstay Dogecoin. Meantime, an index tracking some of the largest decentralized finance protocols and apps -- the Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index -- is up about 50% since the start of July.

“There’s generally been pretty positive crypto sentiment recently: NFTs have helped lead the revival, and the crash from May is further in the rearview mirror,” said Sam Bankman-Fried, chief executive officer of crypto exchange FTX.

And then there are the blockchains looking to compete with Ethereum. Avi Felman, co-portfolio manager at BlockTower Capital, said now that Ethereum’s recent network upgrade is done, speculators are turning their attention toward rival blockchains and their tokens.

Meanwhile, the U.S. equity markets seem to post records daily. Meme stocks are going bonkers too. Jason Urban, co-head of Galaxy Digital Trading, said when the market’s in a such a risk-on mood, crypto can only benefit.

In the four years ending in 2019, correlations between and daily returns for the S&P 500 were generally small, according to Wei Liang at DBS in Singapore. But starting last year, that changed. Amid the pandemic, Bitcoin and U.S. stocks have fallen and rebounded jointly, he said.

“Lately, you see people are concerned about inflation, people are concerned about money supply -- because of that, historically, people always said buy stocks as a hedge against inflation,” Urban said. Now, he added, it’s crypto as well.","('https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2021-08/31/full/1630353924-4152.jpg',)",none
2021-09-02,CNBC,Cryptocurrency investing has a big gender problem,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/cryptocurrency-has-a-big-gender-problem.html,"Cryptocurrency is a 21st century financial instrument with a very 20th century problem: not enough women. Twice as many men as women invest in cryptocurrency (16% of men vs. 7% of women), according to CNBC and Acorn's Invest in You: Next Gen Investor survey, conducted in partnership with Momentive. Women are lagging behind men in their rates of cryptocurrency investing, just as they have historically struggled to keep pace with men in more traditional investment verticals. In fact, in the new survey data, the gender disparity in crypto matches or exceeds the gender gaps in ownership of exchange-traded funds (14% of men vs. 7% of women), individual stocks (40% of men vs. 24% of women), mutual funds (30% of men vs. 20% of women), real estate (36% of men vs. 30% of women), and bonds (14% of men vs. 11% of women).

The Fearless Girl statue is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., June 11, 2020. Brendan McDermid | Reuters

The survey was conducted for CNBC and Acorns by Momentive, the company formerly known as SurveyMonkey, from August 4-9, 2021, among more than 5,530 adults in the U.S., 2,980 of whom have investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, or cryptocurrency.

'Democratizing' investing and gender

Gender disparities have dogged the financial services industry for decades, but cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum, and dogecoin have been promoted as a way to democratize a traditionally walled-off field, welcoming new and more diverse investors into the fold. Only about one in 10 people in the U.S. (11%) currently invest in cryptocurrencies, but so far the industry has not been able to make inroads among the key demographic group of women. That's especially confounding because in other significant ways, cryptocurrency is really living up to its hype in leveling the playing field. Crypto is the only financial vertical that has a higher participation rate among younger adults than older adults: 15% of those 18 to 34 years old own cryptocurrencies, compared with 11% of those ages 35 to 64 and 4% of those 65 and older.

Even more interesting is that people of all races are about equally likely to own cryptocurrency: 11% of whites, 11% of Blacks, 10% of Hispanics, 14% of Asians, and 13% of people of another race all have crypto investments. Even though cryptocurrency has broken down barriers in investing by race, it hasn't managed to do the same by gender.

Black women face the highest investing barriers

Personal investing, and the world of finance in general, is notorious for its historic exclusion of women and people of color. For decades, women could not take out a loan, sign a mortgage, or even own a credit card without having a male co-signer. People of color, too, faced discrimination and systemic barriers to investing. The legacy of these discriminatory practices continues even through today. In the new survey results, Black women are about half as likely as Black men, one third as likely as white women, and one-fourth as likely as white men to own real estate. Similarly, just 51% of Black women say they have a traditional checking account, compared with 63% of Black men, 71% of white women and 78% of white men.

At the same time, Black women have by far the highest rates of student debt: 30% of Black women but just 17% of Black men, 16% of white women, and 13% of white men have student debt. As a still-nascent industry, cryptocurrency is well-positioned to avoid many of the discriminatory pitfalls the traditional investing world has inculcated over the years. Today's would-be investors have more accessible resources — social media channels, online trainings, and targeted marketing — that can get them involved in new or more traditional forms of investing.

Demographics as financial destiny

Without access to these more traditional financial instruments, Black women may feel shut out of the investing world altogether. Women of all races are equally likely to say nobody ever taught them about investing (28% among all women), but Black and Hispanic women still have lower rates of investing relative to white women.

2021-09-02,MarketWatch,Here’s why this billionaire investor predicts cryptocurrencies will ‘go to zero’,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-this-billionaire-investor-predicts-cryptocurrencies-will-go-to-zero-11630323430,"After last week’s dovish Jackson Hole message from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, stocks look set to hover at record levels on Monday.

The Fed chief indicated a gradual easing of support, and markets will be closely watching some big data due this week that could weigh into how fast or slow the central bank proceeds. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing report is due at midweek, followed by nonfarm payrolls on Friday.

Energy is in the spotlight, as well, for Monday, in the wake of one of the biggest hurricanes to ever hit the U.S. mainland.

On to our call of the day, from a billionaire investor who believes investors shouldn’t waste money or time on one increasingly popular asset class that he views as a “bubble.”

“Cryptocurrencies, regardless of where they’re trading today, will eventually prove to be worthless. Once the exuberance wears off, or liquidity dries up, they will go to zero. I wouldn’t recommend anyone invest in cryptocurrencies,” John Paulson, president and portfolio manager of U.S. investment firm Paulson & Co., told Bloomberg Wealth in an interview that published on Monday.

Paulson said it wasn’t even worth shorting bitcoin given its extreme volatility, and instead suggested investors sock money into bullion, due to “a very limited amount of investible gold.” Paulson sees investors pulling money out of fixed income and cash as inflation rises, then heading toward the only logical destination — that is, gold.

For those not familiar with the Paulson name, the former hedge-fund manager made a killing betting against the U.S. housing market before it collapsed.

Bitcoin pushed to $50,000 early last week but then struggled to keep that level, even as Powell comments on Friday weighed on the dollar and gave cryptocurrencies a lift. Bitcoin was trading around $47,000 early Monday.

Paulson had another piece of advice for those who just happen to have $100,000 laying around: Use it to buy your own home. Read the full interview here.

Ida rips across the south

The digging out from one of the worst storms to ever hit the U.S. is set to begin. Hurricane Ida cut power to New Orleans, tearing off rooftops and sent the Mississippi River’s flow in the opposite direction. One death has been reported so far, and rescuers have begun to look for those stranded.

Affirm Holdings shares AFRM, -4.34% are soaring after the buy-now-pay-later fintech group announced late Friday that it has partnered with Amazon AMZN, +0.46% . Elsewhere, Baxter International BAX, -0.71% is reportedly in advanced talks to buy medical-equipment maker Hill-Rom Holdings HRC, -0.13% for around $10 billion.

A Tesla TSLA, +0.13% using its autopilot feature crashed into a Florida Highway Patrol cruiser Saturday, narrowly missing the driver. The U.S. government opened a formal investigation into the electric-car maker’s autonomous-navigation system earlier this month.

The European Union may announce on Monday a recommendation to halt nonessential travel from the U.S., where the COVID-19 infection rate is now above that of the common-currency region. That’s as hospitalizations have been hovering above 100,000 and some southern states are running out of oxygen for patients.

Carnival CCL, -3.31% , meanwhile, is facing a lawsuit that claims the cruise ship failed to protect those taking its cruises from the coronavirus causing COVID-19.

The markets

Stock futures ES00, -0.33% YM00, -0.33% NQ00, -0.27% are barely budging, in line with European equities SXXP, -1.06% . Oil prices CL00, -0.01% CLV21, -0.01% are slipping after rallying ahead of Hurricane Ida, while gasoline prices RBU21 are falling. The storm has knocked out 95% of energy production in the Gulf of Mexico.

2021-09-02,India Today,"Cryptocurrency prices today: Bitcoin, Ether lose momentum as virtual coin market remains volatile",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/cryptocurrency-prices-update-august-30-bitcoin-ether-cardano-dogecoin-price-trends-1847060-2021-08-30,"Popular cryptocurrency prices lost momentum on Monday after rebounding throughout the weekend. At the moment, trends in the broader crypto market remain mixed as trading momentum remains weak.

Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, fell marginally today after rebounding during the weekend. Bitcoin was trading at $47,958, up over 1.17 per cent from its price 24 hours ago at 1:35 pm.

The market capitalisation of the cryptocurrency remains above $900 billion. However, the trading volume has remained weak at $616 million. At the same time, volatility remains high.

Ether, which is the second-most popular cryptocurrency, has also fallen over the past 24 hours. It is trading at $3,179 or nearly per cent lower than its price a day ago.

Decoded | What’s driving demand for cryptocurrencies in India

The market capitalisation of Ether has also fallen to $372.59 billion. Like Bitcoin, the trading volumes for Ether have remained low in the past 24 hours.

Popular altcoins such as XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Stellar, Polkadot, Uniswap, Chainlink, Polygon and Litecoin also remained weaker than their valuation 24 hours ago.

Lower trading activity seems to be the main reason why the cryptocurrency market slightly lost momentum today. However, the momentum may rise today due to some positive developments including Cuba’s intention to regulate cryptocurrency use.

Cuba said it would authorise and regulate the use of cryptocurrency for “reasons of socioeconomic interest”.

Meanwhile, the first cryptocurrency ATM has been opened in Honduras as Bitcoin backers sought to spur demand for virtual assets after neighbouring El Salvador became the first country to establish Bitcoin as legal tender.

Here are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:

Cryptocurrency Price (US Dollar) 24-hour change Market cap (Billion) Volume (24 Hours) Bitcoin 47,895.15 -1.46% $900.48 $616.19 million Ether 3,183.89 -0.99% $373.08 $385.34 million Dogecoin 0.281625 -0.59% $36.87 $1.36 billion Litecoin 173.50 -3.67% $11.87 $2.02 billion XRP 1.14 -0.64% $113.71 $3 billion Cardano 2.82 -0.50% $91.31 $4.35 billion

Including my house help's 14-year old son. True story. I am always asked how to invest in crypto. But I think the most important question people should ask me is, ""Should I invest in crypto?"". Crypto is a new, small, highly immature, and extremely volatile market.

Don't invest in cryptocurrency because you think it's ""cool"". A fixed deposit with a boring bank might not sound cool but may be a better investment for many people. Let's start with six questions that you must answer honestly:

Can you afford to lose your entire crypto investment? Are you tech-savvy and ready to learn how to keep your crypto safe? Are you ready to spend a good amount of time every single day researching cryptos and monitoring your portfolio? Can you wrap your head around the fact that crypto prices depend more on tweets by (evil?) billionaires like Elon Musk and less on logic and economics? Are you ready to understand the meaning of stuff like this? — ""Sharpe Ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility. Volatility measures the price fluctuations of a cryptocurrency and is usually calculated using variance and standard deviation."" Are you ready to spend time looking at graphs like this?

Photo Credit: Rohas Nagpal

If you can honestly answer ""yes"" to all these questions, then let's talk about some recent crypto disasters:

A cryptocurrency called Internet Computer (ICP) started off in the top 10 cryptos of the world. And then crashed more than 90% in a month — from a price of $737.20 to $20.08.

A cryptocurrency called TITAN went from $52.46 to $0.00000003 in 10 days! One of its most famous investors was the non-evil billionaire Mark Cuban. Yes, even super-smart billionaires make bad crypto mistakes.

A cryptocurrency called SafeDollar suddenly went to 0. And this was a stablecoin — its price was supposed to be ""stable""!

If you are still sure that you want to invest in crypto, then let's get started. Over the next few weeks I will talk about:

How to trade and hold crypto

How to pick good cryptos

How to keep your crypto safe

Crypto metrics that every investor must know

Crypto indexes and stacks

How to profit from crypto staking and lending

And I have some homework for you - figure out which of the 3 types of crypto investors you are. For this, read about 3 cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), and decide which one you like the best.

2021-09-02,The Economic Times,Should you invest in cryptocurrency?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/should-you-invest-in-cryptocurrency/articleshow/85711509.cms,"Priya, a young engineering graduate, has been watching the craze for cryptocurrency investing boom in India. The popularity and growth of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin , Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether, Dogecoin have compelled investors and sceptics to take a second look. Around 15 million Indians are said to have invested in private crypto assets. Young investors like Priya are excited about the prospects of strong returns. She is planning to open a crypto trading account. However, she would like to understand each and every aspect of the crypto market before she starts investing in earnest.A cryptocurrency (or crypto) is a non-physical, digital and decentralized currency that is issued by private systems and remains out of the purview of the government. It is a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Priya will need to store her cryptocurrency in a digital wallet . There were over 4,000 different cryptocurrencies in circulation worldwide, including the market giants Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Much of the interest in these unregulated currencies is to trade for profit, with investors/speculators at times driving prices skyward.Cryptocurrencies work using blockchain technology, a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security. Transactions cannot be altered or deleted and are hard for hackers to tamper with. In addition, transactions require a two-factor authentication process. The investor can add more and more digital transactions and the blockchain gets updated automatically.In order to trade in cryptocurrencies, Priya must open a crypto trading account on a cryptocurrency exchange. A cryptocurrency exchange, such as Coinbase , helps in the trading of cryptocurrencies in various currencies and also provides wallet services. It acts as a broker and facilitates transactions between the buyers and sellers, while their main sources of revenue are transaction fees and commissions. Once the account is opened and KYC formalities are completed, Priya can deposit money in the cryptocurrency exchange via card transactions or direct bank transfers to purchase cryptocurrencies, against a fee.While crypto trading is the current rage and may even yield potentially high returns, Priya must understand that cryptocurrency is an incredibly speculative and a volatile buy. The market is still in its infancy. Investing in something that’s new comes with challenges, so she must be prepared for ups and downs, including some dramatic swings. If her investment portfolio or risk appetite can’t handle that, cryptocurrency might not be a wise choice for her.(Content on this page is courtesy Centre for Investment Education and Learning (CIEL).

2021-09-02,Cointelegraph,"Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, ADA, LUNA, VET, XTZ",https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-ada-luna-vet-xtz,"On Aug. 27, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank will start tapering its $120 billion monthly bond purchases by the end of the year, but the interest rate hikes would have to wait until the job market and inflation pass a more stringent test.

In response to the speech, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell, the S&P 500 index rose to a new all-time high, and Bitcoin (BTC) surged about $1,500 in under an hour. This showed that market participants viewed the speech as “dovish.”

Bitcoin’s uncertainty near the $50,000 mark has analysts divided about its short-term directional move. Analyst Ryan Clark believes the current consolidation in Bitcoin is similar to the one seen below $24,000 before the breakout in December 2020, but TraderXO believes that BTC may correct to the $39,000 to $42,000 zone in September.

Will Bitcoin’s consolidation below $50,000 attract buying in altcoins? Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the next few days.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin bounced off the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), calculated at $46,823, on Aug. 27, but the bulls have not been able to push the price above the overhead resistance zone at $50,000 to $50,500. This suggests that bears have not thrown in the towel yet.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price turns down from the current level and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the short-term traders are booking profits. That may pull the price down to $43,927 and then to $42,451.

If the price rebounds off this support, the BTC/USDT pair may remain range-bound between $42,451 and $50,500 for a few more days.

Alternatively, if the price turns up from the current level or bounces off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the overhead zone. If they manage to do that, the pair may start its journey toward $60,000.

The moving averages on the four-hour chart have flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is close to the midpoint, indicating a range-bound action in the near term. The price may remain stuck between $46,200 and $49,500 for some time.

If bulls drive the price above $49,500, the pair may challenge the $50,500 resistance. A breakout and close above this level could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. On the contrary, if bears sink the price below $46,200, the pair may drop to $44,000.

ADA/USDT

Cardano (ADA) is currently consolidating between $2.97 and $2.47. The price had dropped to the breakout level at $2.47 on Aug. 26, but the sharp rebound off it on Aug. 27 shows that bulls have flipped the level into support.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

A consolidation near the all-time high is a positive sign as it shows that traders continue to buy on dips. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If buyers drive and sustain the price above the psychological barrier at $3, the ADA/USDT pair could resume its uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $3.50.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the $2.97-to-$3 resistance zone, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. A break and close below $2.47 will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened.

The RSI on the four-hour chart has formed a negative divergence, indicating that the upward momentum may be slowing down. If bears pull and sustain the price below the 50-day simple moving average, the pair may drop to $2.47.

A strong bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $2.47 and $2.97 for some time. The bears will have to sink the price below the $2.47-to-$2.31 support zone to gain the upper hand. Alternatively, the uptrend may resume if bulls drive and sustain the price above $2.97.

LUNA/USDT

Terra protocol’s LUNA token is in a strong uptrend. After a few days of consolidation, the price rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($26.42) on Aug. 27, indicating that the sentiment remains positive.

LUNA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that bulls have the upper hand. The first target objective on the upside is a move to $43 and, if that level is crossed, the LUNA/USDT pair may rally to $50.

However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests that bears are defending the overhead resistance aggressively. If bears pull the price below $32, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA.

This is an important level for the bulls to defend. A strong bounce off it will suggest that the uptrend remains intact, but a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate that the bullish momentum has weakened.

The four-hour chart shows a broadening triangle formation, which indicates an increase in volatility. The buyers had pushed the price above the triangle but they could not sustain the breakout, suggesting aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels.

If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again make one more attempt to clear the overhead hurdle. If bulls sustain the price above the triangle, it may signal the resumption of the up-move. The pattern target of this setup is $46.95.

Alternatively, if the price breaks below the moving averages, the pair could drop to the support line of the triangle. A break and close below this support will signal that bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair may then drop to the $22.40-to-$20.81 support zone.

VET/USDT

After the sharp recovery from its recent lows at $0.05 on July 21, VeChain (VET) has formed a pennant. This setup will complete after the price breaks above or below the formation.

VET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.11) has flattened out and the RSI has dropped close to the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. A breakout and close above the resistance line of the pennant will suggest the resumption of the up-move.

The first target objective on the upside is a move to $0.16 and, if this level is crossed, the VET/USDT pair may rally to $0.19.

Conversely, if the price breaks below the support line of the pennant, the bullish view will be negated. The pair could then decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.09).

The four-hour chart shows the price is getting squeezed inside the triangle. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

The rebound off the support line is facing stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA. If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to sink the pair below the support line. If they succeed, the pair may drop to $0.082.

On the other hand, if bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair could challenge the resistance line. A breakout and close above this resistance could signal the resumption of the up-move.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) completed a rounding-bottom pattern when the price broke and closed above the overhead resistance at $4.47. This suggests the start of a new uptrend that has a pattern target at $6.85.

XTZ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Usually, after the price breaks out of a setup, it retests the breakout level. In this case, the XTZ/USDT pair could drop to $4.47. If bulls flip this level into support, it will suggest the start of a new uptrend. The rising 20-day EMA ($4.25) and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate advantage to buyers.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could trap several aggressive bulls and result in a decline to the 50-day SMA ($3.31).

The four-hour chart shows that the pair picked up momentum after it rose above the $4.47 resistance. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand.

The pair could rally to the overhead resistance zone at $6.31 to $6.50, where bears may mount a stiff resistance. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. That could open the doors for a decline to the breakout level at $4.47.

2021-09-02,Bitcoin News,Buying Bitcoin and Ether Just Got Easier in Honduras With Cryptocurrency ATM – Featured Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/buying-bitcoin-ether-easier-honduras-cryptocurrency-atm/,"Buying Bitcoin and Ether Just Got Easier in Honduras With Cryptocurrency ATM

A cryptocurrency ATM has been installed in Honduras where users can buy bitcoin and ether. According to reports, this is the first crypto ATM in the country. Honduras borders El Salvador, where bitcoin is set to become legal tender in a little over a week.

Cryptocurrency ATM in Honduras

A cryptocurrency ATM launched this week in Honduras, Reuters reported Friday. According to reports, this is the first cryptocurrency ATM in the country. It allows users to buy bitcoin and ethereum using the local lempira currency.

The Republic of Honduras is a country in Central America. It borders El Salvador, the country which passed a law making bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The law is set to go into effect on Sept. 7.

The cryptocurrency ATM in Honduras, locally called La Bitcoinera, was installed in an office tower in the capital of Tegucigalpa by Honduran firm TGU Consulting Group.

TGU CEO Juan Mayen, the 28-year-old CEO who led the crypto ATM effort, explained that there was no automated way to buy cryptocurrencies until now, stating:

You had to do it peer-to-peer, look for someone who … was willing to do it, meet in person and carry x amount of cash, which is very inconvenient and dangerous given the environment in Honduras.

The cryptocurrency ATM tracking website Coinatmradar does not currently list any cryptocurrency ATMs for Honduras.

Mayen said that he hopes to install more cryptocurrency ATMs. He noted that many software developers in the country are already paid in cryptocurrencies, emphasizing that using cryptocurrency will lower the cost of sending remittances.

In 2020, Hondurans living abroad sent $5.7 billion, about 20% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), in remittances.

With the upcoming Bitcoin Law going into effect, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said last week that 200 crypto ATMs are being installed.

Initially, in 2013, when bitcoin was launched, the first few years went in hush-hush. The technology was new. This was something that was a store of value with no central authority.Not only the government but also, enthusiastic investors were speculating how bitcoin will turn out to be. When after the end of 2016, this revolutionary financial asset made noise, the Indian government came to action.Any government of the world is about authority, power and regulation. And bitcoin, or rather say, cryptocurrency , took that power from the government. There was no bank, no RBI or no scrutiny around your money. You held an asset and you did your investment, you used the money gained and you made sure your investment strategy works for you. There was no advisory, no policymakers, no brainwashing whatsoever. The bitcoin investment grew so much in 2017, that the Indian government had to come into action.When wheels came, bicycles were invented. We all thought this is going to stay. Then came the motors and we thought the motor vehicles were going to stay. Then came the Wright brothers, who told us that we also could fly. But when the finite supply of automobile fuel would be exhausted, none of these would matter.On the same lines, we thought writing letters is the best way to reach farther places. Then boom. The 2000s came and the internet was all over. The communication could be done in milliseconds.So now let us talk about what we cannot do when there is a ban. When we say the ban, we mean that the transactions between the bank and your crypto exchanges will be stopped. This means that you will not be able to convert your local currency into buying any kind of cryptocurrency. This also means that you will not be able to liquidate your HODLed cryptos and get them encashed. This means, your HODLed cryptocurrency will be on *HODL* for some time more until the ban is uplifted.But what if you send your cryptos to someone who is not an Indian resident and belongs to a country where crypto is legal. Well, in that case, you can always send your acquired crypto, and get the equivalent INR in your bank. However, this procedure of exit would come at a cost. The foreign exchange cost and penalties would cost you more than the actual exchange fees, had there been no ban in your own country.But, you still need to identify the catch here. By the above method, we see that the transactions that involve crypto are still possible. No government can ever tame the internet. The government tried to ban PUBG. The gaming community in India identified VPNs that would still make PUBG accessible to them. The government tried banning porn, but anything that is accessible to everyone, or is made available on the cloud, can never be fully tamed. The same goes with the decentralised and open source-based cryptocurrencies as well. Unocoin is one such platform that lets its user buy, sell and trade 40+ cryptocurrencies. The transactional fees are very nominal as compared to the features that it provides. Unocoin has always respected and abided by the laws set by the government of India and RBI. But it also makes sure it creates a space where the crypto exchanges are smooth. Hence, Unocoin collaborated with Airtm for a cross-platform transaction. With this Unocoin - Airtm collab, any Unocoin user can buy any crypto from either platform in exchange for his/her local fiat currency and via the pairing coin USTether ( USDT ), can convert his/her acquired cryptos into another crypto/fiat currency from the other platform.It is like entering a bridge, walking on the bridge and reaching the other side of the river. With the USDT acting as a pairing coin or the bridge, the walk from one end to the other and back to the first end is possible.While there are speculations on the cryptocurrency, the virtual currency enthusiasts know for sure, that these are only the ups and downs that come in their investment plan. India would eventually be a country where there will be no inhibitions over cryptocurrencies, sooner or later.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85732188,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56088,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg',)",none

Ethereum

Ethereum is a smart contracts platform that hosts the majority of today's significant decentralized apps (DApps). Although Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, Ethereum is the blockchain that collects and maintains data as well as housing a variety of apps.

So, why do we predict Ethereum to skyrocket this year? Let's see what happens. Its London Hard Fork update arrived this month, complete with its five EIPs. The update, which promised decreased transaction costs and a deflationary mechanism, was met with a tremendous bull run by ETH. Not only that, but the excitement surrounding Ethereum 2.0 is also driving up the price. Who knows how much ETH will rise once the transfer is complete.

Chainlink (LINK)

Chainlink is an Ethereum-based decentralized blockchain oracle network. The network is designed to make it easier to move tamper-proof data from off-chain sources to smart contracts on the blockchain.

The LINK token from Chainlink is an ERC677 token, which is an extension of the ERC20 standard. Tokens serve as data payloads, delivering essential data from off-chain sources to smart contracts, which subsequently operate in accordance with the token's contents. [5] [a better source is required] The trade value created from these tokens, according to Chainlink, is used to pay node operators for accessing data from smart contracts, as well as deposits made by node operators as requested by contract designers. Because the ERC677 token keeps all of the functionality of an ERC20 token, it may be stored in any ERC20 wallet.

Uniswap (UNI)

The Uniswap decentralized cryptocurrency exchange's governance token is Uniswap. To grasp how it works and whether the token is worthwhile to purchase, we must first comprehend decentralized exchanges, or DEXs.

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on Ethereum that primarily trades cryptocurrencies and other tokens. DEXs are the next big thing in cryptocurrency trading, especially in light of the recent problems surrounding centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance. Decentralized solutions are becoming increasingly popular among users as a method to bypass the middleman and take control of their own affairs.

Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot, a relative newcomer to the crypto industry, has already astonished crypto traders all around the world. Polkadot launched in August 2020 and quickly rose to the top 5 cryptocurrencies, where it has remained since.

Polkadot's primary goal is to enable cross-chain transfers. It allows a range of assets, not just crypto, to be shared between multiple blockchains in this way. As certain as we are that cryptocurrencies will be a part of the future, we are equally certain that multi-chain will be the next big thing in blockchain technology.

Aave (AAVE)

Aave is a decentralized financial system that enables people to lend and borrow digital assets.

Decentralized lending, as you might expect, has a higher interest rate than centralized lending. It also provides more privacy and security. Depositing digital assets into properly designed liquidity pools allows lenders to earn interest. Borrowers can then use this liquidity to take out flash loans using their bitcoin as collateral.

AAVE is the network's governance token and offers its holders discounted platform costs. With the shift to decentralized finance and digital banking, this appears to have a lot of potentials.

Meanwhile, Cuba's government said it would recognise and regulate cryptocurrencies for payments on the island.

A resolution published in the Official Gazette said the Central Bank will set rules for such currencies and determine how to license providers of related services within Cuba.

The popularity of such currencies has grown among a technologically savvy group in Cuba as it has become harder to use dollars, in part because of toughened embargo rules imposed under former president Donald Trump.

U.S. Senator Pat Toomey is soliciting ideas and proposals on cryptocurrency regulation. He explained that he “intends to use the responses in forming legislation that clarifies ambiguity around how existing laws, especially in the tax and securities realms, may apply to cryptocurrencies.”

US Senator Pat Toomey Seeks Proposals on Crypto Regulation

The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs announced Thursday that Ranking Member Pat Toomey is requesting “feedback on clarifying laws around cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.” The committee will collect proposals from Aug. 26 to Sept. 27. All proposals will subsequently be published.

Senator Toomey detailed that he is “soliciting ideas and legislative proposals to ensure federal law supports the development of emerging cryptocurrency and open blockchain network technologies while continuing to protect crypto investors.”

He explained that he “intends to use the responses in forming legislation that clarifies ambiguity around how existing laws, especially in the tax and securities realms, may apply to cryptocurrencies.”

The senator emphasized:

Rather than trying to ignore or suppress cryptocurrency and related technologies, regulators and legislators alike need to recognize that open, public networks are here to stay. Our laws and regulations must adapt to these developments.

Potential topics that the proposals should address include securities implications of cryptocurrencies, payments and money transmission supervision, stablecoins, cryptocurrency exchanges, custody regulation, banking authorities, and decentralized finance (defi).

“Not only might cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies be as revolutionary as the internet, [but] they also have the potential to build wealth and financial independence for individuals who are empowered to engage in financial transactions directly with each other, free from oft-costly middlemen,” Senator Toomey continued, elaborating:

That’s why it’s important Congress gets this right and ensures the United States remains at the forefront of cryptocurrency and fintech innovation.

Magnetic Managing Director Megan Kaspar, who called ether's tripling to top $3,000 back when it was still closer to $1,000 in January, told Yahoo Finance Friday that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could still hit her $8,000 to $10,000 price target in 2021.

""Investors are still using crypto as a favorite tool to hedge against inflation,"" she said, adding that two new upgrades are likely to catapult the ethereum network when completed. Those proposals will initiate the ""burn"" or elimination of the fractions of ether that had previously been paid to miners in transactions.

""Towards the end of the year, beginning of next year, we'll have about a million worth of ethereum coming out of supply. So that will initiate it becoming a deflationary asset,"" Kaspar said.

At the same time, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, transacting on the ethereum network have been attracting a lot more attention lately. This week, the cartoon image of a rock, offered through the EtherRock NFT collection, was sold for more than $1.7 million. Overall, monthly NFT sales hit a record high near $900 million during August, according to industry tracker NonFungible.

That spike in attention is continuing to bring people into ethereum, since many of the NFT sales on sites like OpenSea and others price NFT auctions in ether.

""I think we'll continue to see this as the younger generation feels comfortable buying and owning assets that are not physical, and that, again, is sort of the tech trend that we're moving towards in dematerialization,"" Kaspar said.

2021-08-26,CNBC,Cuba's central bank now recognizes cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/cubas-central-bank-now-recognizes-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin.html,"Thousands of Cubans take part in rare protests against the communist government, marching through a town chanting ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""We want liberty"" in Havana, on July 11, 2021.

Cuba will now recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, citing ""reasons of socioeconomic interest.""

Resolution 215, which was published Thursday in the state-run Official Gazette, says the central bank will set new rules for how to deal with digital currencies. Commercial providers of related services will now need a license from the central bank to continue operations.

The American embargo on the communist state has turned Cuba into a pariah in the global economy. Cuba's decision to join El Salvador in embracing decentralized virtual cash could help the country to circumvent the U.S. sanctions regime, which was dialed up under former President Donald Trump and has been extended under President Joe Biden.

""It's historic that they are embracing it,"" said Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst, who spent four years working in crypto in Cuba.

""This is a conservative government still set in traditional Marxist ways. In fact, the communist Cuban central bank was founded by Che Guevara. The fact that they are cautiously regulating shows they are interested in what it can bring them,"" Boaz said.

Sending and receiving money between the U.S. and Cuba became extremely difficult under the Trump administration, according to Dr. Mrinalini Tankha, a professor of anthropology at Portland State University, who has been doing research on Cuba for 10 years.

In 2020, Western Union, a particularly significant channel for remittances that had been operating in Cuba for more than 20 years, shuttered all of its 400-plus locations, amid increasingly aggressive Trump-era sanctions.

The process of getting money into and out of the country was made even more complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Before the Covid outbreak, Tankha said, some Cubans would turn to underground and somewhat semi-formalized courier services called mulas, where agencies would carry cash to Cuba and distribute it to people on the island. But as the pandemic grounded flights around the world, even this path to cash became much more difficult, she said.

It was this desperate need of cash — against a backdrop of a global pandemic and blocked access to the world economy — that helped foment a rise in crypto adoption in Cuba, experts say.

""There is a kind of niche sector of people who have turned to cryptocurrency,"" said Tankha.

She credits the burgeoning crypto community for the rise of the internet in Cuba, as well as the fact that there are so many more people who have smartphones and 3G connectivity. A weak local currency is also a factor likely contributing to the appeal of bitcoin.

The use case for crypto in Cuba transcends the cross-border transfer of money. It's also about Cubans looking to open up their income-generating potential.

""If you're a software developer, or if you're an NFT artist, you could actually get paid through cryptocurrency for your labor, and I think that's where the potential actually is,"" said Tankha. ""It opens up a whole new economy for Cubans to participate in.""

Photographer Gabriel Guerra Bianchini is doing just that. Havana-based Bianchini was one of the first artists in Cuba to break into the world of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.

""My first work sold in six days for 1.6 ethereum,"" said Bianchini. ""This is bigger than just making money. This is really freedom.""

However, receiving funds, even via crypto channels, requires some creativity, because many of the exchanges require know-your-customer compliance.

""The minute that Cubans participate in this ecosystem, they face a lot of risks, even if they're operating with a VPN where they're able to hide their location,"" said Tankha.

Tankha told CNBC that many exchanges, including those not based in the U.S., continue to geo-block Cubans.

Experts told CNBC that it is still a long road ahead for mass adoption of crypto in Cuba.

The resolution itself — while a promising sign for Cubans keen to participate in the world economy via bitcoin rails — is hardly a warm embrace of all things crypto. The text includes a healthy dose of skepticism, such as a disclaimer warning citizens about the risks of virtual assets and the ancillary service providers, which the government says operate at the ""margins of the banking and financial system.""

But Sobrado is optimistic that any sort of regulatory attention with respect to crypto is a good thing.

""Regulators around the world, from communist Cuba's central bank to the SEC, are trying to come to grips with the cryptocurrency industry. This implies that crypto is a global phenomenon and regulators have decided that it's here to stay and worth engaging with,"" said Sobrado.

""Strangely enough it's bringing some sort of legitimacy to the space. It's gotten too big to ignore,"" he said.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106910035-1626177480909-gettyimages-1233929408-AFP_9ER3N8.jpeg?v=1627050044',)",none

According to Aljazeera, the Caribbean nation’s central bank will establish rules for mainstreaming cryptocurrency transactions. Cuban authorities are also expected to distribute relevant licenses to businesses based on the crypto-related services they provide.

Some sources claim that the move to allow cryptocurrency as a legal tender has been well received by Cuba’s tech-savvy population as the country had to temporarily stop accepting cash bank deposits in United States dollars, given tighter restrictions set by former U.S. President Donald Trump.

Struggling economies, such as El Salvador, have also started mainstreaming Bitcoin (BTC) adoption. On Monday, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele announced the construction of country-wide infrastructure to support the adoption of Bitcoin.

Related: El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption may transform remittances in Central America

El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption policy can reduce overall remittance costs and potentially transform the remittance landscape across Central America, according to the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI).

2021-08-26,Al Jazeera,"Cuba to recognise, regulate cryptocurrency",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/27/cuba-to-recognise-regulate-cryptocurrency-govt-resolution,"Popularity of the digital currency has grown in Cuba, in part because of restrictions on remittances from the US.

Cuba has said it will recognise – and regulate – cryptocurrencies for payments on the island in a move that could help to circumvent American sanctions.

A resolution published in the Official Gazette on Thursday said the central bank will set rules on cryptocurrencies and determine how to license providers of related services within the communist state.

The announcement comes as the popularity of cryptocurrency has grown in Cuba among some technologically savvy groups, as it has become increasingly difficult to send and use US dollars on the island, in part because of toughened embargo rules imposed under former United States President Donald Trump.

While some expected President Joe Biden to seek to normalise relations, as former President Barack Obama did, he has instead taken a harder line, imposing further sanctions against Cuban officials following crackdowns on rare protests in the country.





Cuba’s move comes after El Salvador recently announced it would recognise the use of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as a way to encourage remittances from its citizens living abroad.

The currencies, which can shift wildly in value, are usually independent of any central bank and use widely distributed blockchain computer codes to keep track of transfers.

Because they can be used for long-distance transactions that are supposedly anonymous, they are often popular with people attempting to evade government regulations, which could include circumventing US restrictions on sending money to Cuba.





The resolution said the central bank can authorise use of cryptocurrencies “for reasons of socioeconomic interest” but with the state assuring operations are controlled.

It also explicitly noted that operations could not involve illegal activities.

A local cryptocurrency expert, programmer Erich García, told The Associated Press some Cubans are already using such devices, often via gift cards, for online purchases.","('https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AP21089552118817.jpg?resize=1200%2C630',)",none

now exist. It can be difficult to pick winners in such a saturated space.

Insider has asked several experts about where they see the biggest opportunities in altcoins .

Cryptocurrencies have exploded in popularity over the last several months. Of course, the most popular remains bitcoin.

But some other smaller cryptos are gaining serious steam as well, as the concept of digital currencies continues to seep into the public consciousness.

However, it can be difficult to know which cryptocurrencies to invest in, or whether you should in the first place. There are currently thousands of different types of coins on the market. And some - like dogecoin, which was founded as a joke - don't appear to be serious. Others, like some built on the Ethereum blockchain, appear to have better use cases.

Crypto is an esoteric domain - its intricacies can be difficult to understand, especially for those new to the space.

To help cut through the noise, Insider has talked to several experts about which altcoins - cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin - they believe have the best upside. These experts also described the fundamentals and technicals that make these altcoins attractive. Their views are shared in the articles below.

Many altcoins are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Aya Kantorovich, the head of institutional coverage at crypto exchange FalconX, shared nine coins built on top of the ethereum blockchain that she thinks have solid use cases.

Though some recovery has been observed in Bitcoin, all most other popular cryptocurrencies fell.

The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure due to heavy sell-off since Tuesday. Bitcoin was trading at $47,121.64, up 51 per cent at 11:30 am. Bitcoin’s value has fallen over $240 in the past 24 hours and its market capitalisation has increased marginally to $885 billion.

Ether’s valuation has also fallen over the past 24 hours. It was trading at $3,105.63, down 0.48 per cent. It’s market capitalisation has fallen to $363.87 billion. Other altcoins such as XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Stellar, Chainlink, Polygon and Litecoin fell.

Analysts, however, believe that the current weakness in the cryptocurrency market will fade in the near term due as digital coins witness higher adoption across the world.

Commenting on the weakness, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The past 24 hours were highly volatile for the crypto markets. Both Bitcoin and Ether made struggled to find support.”

“The entire market felt the shivers of this volatility. Altcoins went under the hammer,” he added.

“However, towards the end of the day, there was some recovery as Bitcoin seemed to settle around the $47,000 mark.”

Here are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:

Top Cryptocurrency Rates",https://www.news18.com/news/business/bitcoin-price-today-falls-below-47000-ether-dogecoin-drop-top-cryptocurrency-rates-4132463.html,"Bitcoin Price slumped 2.81 per cent day-to-day to $47,373.83 at 0808 hours IST, according to coinmarketcap.com. Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency surged to $50,000. In April, the world biggest currency Bitcoin surged and hit an all-time high at $65,000. Bitcoin witnessed a sharp fall from $65,000 in April to $28,800 in June, after a massive sell-off in June and July, triggered by Chinese ban on the corporates, financial companies, payment companies, providing services related to cryptocurrency.

“Bitcoin has broken out of the rectangle pattern after 12 weeks of consolidation. It now trades around the 1st level support on the trendline. Day close below the trendline($46,640) may put sell pressure on Bitcoin and it may test the 2nd level support around $41,000-$42,000. Corporates like Microstrategy still find Bitcoin attractive at this level, they bought around $177 million worth of Bitcoin at $45,294 per coin.Key Levels for Bitcoin -Resistance - $53,000, Support - $41,000,”Siddharth Menon, COO WazirX said.

On the other hand, Ether, the rival currency of Bitcoin was trading at $3,124 or down 2.81 per cent at the time of this article. It was trading down 3.46 per cent over the last week. The market cap for Ether stood at $366.28.72 billion.

According to ZebPay’s trade desk, Ethereum faces a stiff resistance at $3,335, which it hasn’t been able to beat, which means that bears are defending aggressively. Signs of weakness might emerge, if the asset turns close to $3,000. Another important event to watch out for is the ETH options expiry due tomorrow, which might impact the spot prices too.

“Ether made a ‘Double Bottom pattern or a ‘W’ pattern at $1,721. It completed the pattern at $2,400 giving a breakout above the neckline with good volumes and the asset witnessed a sharp rally surging almost by 96.8% making the high of $3,380. Post this move, the asset has faced stiff resistance around the $3,400 mark and the prices are consolidating and trading in a broad range from $3,350 to $2,975. Breakouts on either side will further decide the trend for the asset. Ether resistance 1: $3,400, resistance 2: $3,800, support 1 $2,950, support 2 $2,650, Zebpay’s trade desk said.

The third spot was occupied by Cardano, which was trading at $2.59, down 4.52 per cent at the time of this article. The Cardano was trading up 6.89 per cent over the last week. Binance Coin stood at $483.83, up 5.09 per cent over the past 24 hours. The Binance Coin was trading up 12.13 per cent over the last week. The market cap for Binance Coin stood at $81.3 billion.

The global crypto market cap is $2.02 trillion, a 3.46 per cent decrease over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $111.24 billion, which makes a 1.42 per cent decrease.

The volume of all stable coins is now $88.0 billion, which is 79.13 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per Coinmarketcap.com.

“The Altcoin markets have formed similar charts like Bitcoin. It is trading around the buy zone. Markets always give opportunity for the new Investors to start their journey. One needs to approach the markets with proper risk assessment and diversify. Buying on support has most of the times proven to be a good strategy with a long term view, some of the disciplined.

A resolution published in the Official Gazette said the Central Bank will set rules for such currencies and determine how to license providers of related services within Cuba.

The popularity of such currencies has grown among a technologically savvy group in Cuba as it has become harder to use dollars, in part because of toughened embargo rules imposed under former President Donald Trump.

The Central American nation of El Salvador recently announced it would recognise use of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as a way to encourage remittances from its citizens living abroad. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.88 lakhs as of 11am IST on August 27.

The currencies, which can wobbly wildly up and down in value, are usually independent of any central bank and use widely distributed blockchain computer codes to keep track of transfers.

Because they can be used for long-distance transactions that are supposedly anonymous, they are often popular with people attempting to evade government regulations — presumably including US restrictions on sending money to places such as Cuba.

The resolution says the Central Bank can authorise use of cryptocurrencies “for reasons of socioeconomic interest” but with the state assuring that their operations are controlled. It also explicitly noted that operations could not involve illegal activities.

2021-08-26,NDTV.com,"Are Cryptocurrencies Interconvertible? Yes, But Beware Of Volatility",https://www.ndtv.com/business/are-cryptocurrencies-interconvertible-have-a-look-2516860,"In India, crypto finance is a grey zone and most businesses prefer cash or e-commerce

Cryptocurrency is getting more and more popular with every passing day. From young entrepreneurs to global business magnates, all have been dazed by this new disruption in the global economic setup. But a few investors or potential investors are still questioning certain features of the crypto coins. In India, crypto finance remains a grey zone and most businesses prefer cash or e-commerce transactions. The scenario may change in the future but for now, inter convertibility of cryptocurrency can save us from that.

Many wonder whether or not it is possible to convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency or cash. The answer is yes. Cryptocurrency is interconvertible to fiat currency. You should remember that crypto money is not the same as money earned in games or such platforms but it is real money though you can't touch it or see it.

Convertible virtual or digital currency

Cryptocurrencies, unlike virtual currencies earned in video games, are exchangeable for real currency and are called convertible virtual currency. It refers to such currency that can be used as a substitute for real and legally recognised currency though it may not have a legal tender. These conversions can be easily made through currency exchange services or peer-to-peer networks. Bitcoin, Ether and Ripple are some examples of interconvertible crypto. However, Bitcoin remains the most popular in the game.

How to convert cryptocurrency into cash?

Let us focus on two main ways in which this can be done:

1) One way is to convert the crypto money through a currency exchange system or a broker. Experts call this method safe and secure but it is also time-consuming. You request a broker to take your crypto deposit and transfer the cash to your account. Due to certain restrictions, the withdrawal has to be made through the same account through which the deposit was carried out. The transfer of the amount may take a few days.

2) Another method involves appealing to peer-to-peer platforms. You simply need to sell your digital currency in return for cash. This is a quick and anonymous method. However, beware of fraudulent users.

Are you having second thoughts before converting crypto?

Cryptocurrency is highly volatile. Its value fluctuates very often and may rise or dip suddenly. Any decision to convert them requires a good judgement of the future prospects of the crypto.

Turning digital currency into cash may also subject it to taxation. Digital currency in India is yet not under any regulation. However, once converted into fiat currency, there's a high probability that it will be counted under taxable assets.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/s9ng9nc_cryptocurrrency-generic650_625x300_11_August_21.jpg',)",none

Bitcoin is up 63% this year (year-to-date), though, far away from its record just below $65,000 in April.

Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also plummeted over the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrency funds saw their first inflows in seven weeks as investors poured money into altcoins such as ether, cardano, and Solana last week, according to a report by digital-asset manager CoinShares.

Digital asset funds saw net inflows of $21 million last week. However, during the six-week period, the longest losing streak since January 2018, digital asset investment products saw total redemption of $115 million.

However, bitcoin saw its seventh straight week of outflows, as investors took out $2.8 million from funds based on the world’s biggest cryptocurrency during last week. Ether saw minor inflows totalling $3.2 million last week along with other altcoins such as cardano, litecoin and polkadot, which saw inflows of $6.4 million, $1.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Later, supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped the Bitcoin rally.

Here is a look at what it means to burn a coin.It is the act of sending cryptocurrency tokens to a wallet that has no access key. Without the private key, these tokens cannot be accessed by anyone and are lost forever.Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex, said this is primarily done to control the price of the coin concerned. ""Since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered, everyone can verify that the coins were actually burned.""Recently, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, burned more than 90 per cent of his Shiba Inu tokens. After the London Hard Fork update, close to $0.5 million worth of Ethereum is being burned every hour.All cryptocurrency coins can be burnt. The decision to burn tokens is usually vested in the developer team of the coin. Sometimes, coin burns can be initiated by the core community also.This process is highly similar to the idea of a publicly traded company buying back its stock, said Darshan Bathija, Co-founder & CEO, Vauld. ""A project’s developers buy tokens back from the market or burn parts of the supply.""The portion of the coins that is being burnt can be verified on the blockchain. These coins are sent to a wallet to which no one has access. ""It can be done in several ways, most commonly by sending the coins to a so-called eater address. Its current balance is publicly visible on the blockchain, but access to the contents is unavailable to anyone,"" said Bathija.There are different reasons to burn cryptocurrency coins. It is known to directly incentivise and reward a project’s investor base. Coin burns directly affect the dynamics of supply and demand. The most notable objective is to create a deflationary effect. By reducing the overall number of tokens in circulation, these events make tokens scarce and boost the cryptocurrency’s valuation.""It drives the coin price higher. It makes existing investors pretty happy as the value of their investments move northwards,"" added Patel of Mudrex.

2021-08-26,Yahoo Finance,"London burning! 100,000 ETH up in smoke after Ethereum upgrade",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/london-burning-100-000-eth-164002089.html,"As Ethereum 2.0 begins to materialise following the EIP-1559 upgrade, a jaw-dropping $315 million of ETH has been burned by the new mechanism, it has been revealed.

In just the past week, the deposit contract addresses received a monumental 50,000 Ethereum (ETH) – valued at $155M – representing a significant rise in the number of interested investors.

This could, in part, be attributed to the extension of Ethereum 2.0 staking on popular Ledger devices.

The Ethereum 2.0 staking contract recently became the single largest Ethereum wallet, overtaking Wrapped Ether (WETH).

The total ETH staked with Ethereum 2.0 now stands at 7,150,594 ETH, which is worth a staggering $23bn.

Since the implementation of the London Hard Fork’s EIP-1559, the network has burned in excess of 100,000 ETH worth more than $315m.

The London Hard Fork event, alongside the highly-anticipated introduction of EIP-3554 at the start of August, drove a surge in network usage and marked the first noteworthy rise in Ethereum chain activity in more than four months.

Many attribute the 9% rise to EIP-1559, which has simplified and eased the transactional costs (gas fees) charged by the network – alongside introducing a burning mechanism to deflate the price.

What is London Hard Fork and EIP-1559?

London hard fork is a vital stepping stone for the network, ahead of the massive shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to Ethereum 2.0’s proof-of-stake (PoS) technology aimed at saving the network from near paralysis.

A hard fork occurs when there is a major alteration to the protocol of a blockchain network that results in a divergent split between the old protocol and the newer version. In a hard fork, miners must choose whether to continue validating the old blockchain or the new one.

The London hard fork was the latest update, and incorporates five new Ethereum Improvement Proposals – (known as EIPs) – which are all temporary until the permanent Ethereum 2.0 update.

Story continues

EIP-1559 was an exciting proposal for the introduction of a ‘base fee’ that tracks gas fee prices across the entire Ethereum network in order to ensure accurate gas fee predictions for network users, while also introducing a deflationary measure that burns transaction fees.

2021-08-26,Yahoo Finance,Latest Ethereum price and analysis (ETH to USD),https://finance.yahoo.com/news/latest-ethereum-price-analysis-eth-111116777.html,"Ethereum is currently trading back below $3,100 following a gruelling sell-off across the entire cryptocurrency market overnight.

The industry’s second-largest asset has enjoyed a fruitful month of price action, rallying from $1,700 in July to a monthly high in August of $3,390.

However, the tide appears to have turned in the short-term, with Ethereum failing to close a daily candle above $3,320 following a string of stubborn attempts.

Key levels of support remain at $3,000 and $2,880, although it must be noted that if Ethereum can muster some strength from its current region, it could well have enough fuel to break the monthly high given the number of short positions that can be squeezed.

Much of it will depend on the trajectory of Bitcoin, which is trading at $47,000 after another miserable stab at the psychological level of resistance at $50,000.

If Bitcoin can break $50,000 on convincing volume it would indicate a clear change in behaviour, which would reinforce the theory that a “double bubble” scenario may come into play like in 2013.

This pattern was established in 2013 when the Bitcoin bull market formed two major tops before entering an inevitable bear market.

About Ethereum

Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on July 30 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a whitepaper in 2013 describing Ethereum.

Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn’t get buy-in to his proposal.

2021-08-26,The Motley Fool,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Were All Sliding This Morning",https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/26/why-bitcoin-ethereum-and-dogecoin-were-all-sliding/,"What happened

The prices of cryptocurrencies continued their multiday slide Thursday morning as investors weighed recent comments regarding efforts to regulate the industry. Here's how some of the most recognized assets were trading as of noon EDT:

So what

All three assets were still up by more than 50% over the past month, so it shouldn't concern holders that they are giving back some of those gains. What may be of concern are the perceived attitudes of government leaders toward cryptocurrencies. Regulation could play a significant role in shaping the future of this asset class.

Negative comments have come from all over the financial establishment. Earlier this month, the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission called for more investor protection, likening the crypto market to the Wild West. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, has been more measured in her public remarks. While she has called Bitcoin a highly speculative asset, she has also acknowledged crypto's possible benefits such as safer, cheaper, and faster transactions.

A more tangible threat could be the infrastructure bill making its way through Congress. The bipartisan legislation could include a measure that would require many cryptocurrency developers to begin reporting information on their tokens' users. The design of cryptocurrencies makes that virtually impossible.

Now what

At this point, the investing community has gotten accustomed to the volatility of digital assets. Two data points may indicate that the current sell-off will be short-lived.

Chainalysis -- a firm that collects data on the use of blockchains and cryptocurrencies -- has pointed out that those with digital wallets holding more than $50 million have been net buyers of Bitcoin since the end of June. A different report by Blockchain.com shows that the hashrate -- the total combined computing power being used to process transactions and mine coins -- is quickly recovering after China's recent crackdown on crypto mining. Headlines have often driven the price moves of tokens over the short term. Investors should expect that to continue.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640816/gettyimages-1125176633.jpg',)",none

2021-08-26,CNBC,This 33-year-old investor became a 'dogecoin millionaire' this year—here's why Cardano is the next crypto he plans to go 'all in on',https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/why-the-dogecoin-millionaire-plans-to-buy-cardano-next.html,"In February, Glauber Contessoto, 33, invested all of his savings in dogecoin, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that surged in value this year. And about two months later, in April, he says he became a dogecoin millionaire on paper.

Now, Contessoto plans to go ""all in"" on another cryptocurrency, he tells CNBC Make It. His next choice is the Cardano blockchain and its altcoin ADA, which launched in 2017 and recently became the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value, behind bitcoin and ether.

Although he has no plans to sell his dogecoin, ""I'm going to start buying up as much Cardano as humanely possible with every bit of money I start making from now on,"" he says.

Contessoto plans to wait until there is a dip in the price of ADA to begin investing, he says, just as he did with dogecoin.

However, many financial experts would advise against going all in on one investment, especially within the crypto space. Cryptocurrency can be a very risky investment in general, and experts say altcoins can be even more so.

""Risk can be measured in a variety of different ways,"" Meltem Demirors, CoinShares chief strategy officer, previously told CNBC Make It. But ""many of these assets are much more risky than bitcoin and ethereum.""

It's possible to lose your entire investment regardless of how careful you are.

Nonetheless, Contessoto is still bullish on both dogecoin and Cardano.

Since Contessoto didn't buy ether, the cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum blockchain, early on, he views Cardano as the ""next best bet,"" he says. Supporters of Cardano, like Contessoto, see it as a competitor to Ethereum since its creator, Charles Hoskinson, is also a co-founder of Ethereum.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106872490-1624459859222-106872490-1619110744500-image0_1.jpg?v=1626795879',)",none

The U.S. authorities have trained over 50 Nigerian investigators and prosecutors to tackle cryptocurrency-enabled organised crimes.

This was contained in a tweet posted via the verified Twitter account of the U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday.

The training, which was held virtually, focused on enhancing the capacity of Nigerian investigators to investigate cryptocurrency.

The webinar was a collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the U.S. Embassy in Kenya Addis Ababa, the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and the U.S. government on policies and programmes to combat international narcotics and crimes.

“@TheJusticeDept’s #OPDAT @StateINL funded ICHIPs in @USEmbassyAddis and @USinNigeria and @FBI and @US_AU provided cryptocurrency basics webinar to more than 50 investigators and prosecutors in Nigeria to enhance Nigerians’ ability to investigate cryptocurrency,” the Tweet read.

Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and others, that can be used to buy goods and services.

They are also traded for profit.

Being unregulated and requiring no physical bank vaults, they provide a relatively safe haven for criminals to launder proceeds of corruption, fraud, drug trafficking, and other heinous crimes.

There are also concerns about their security with many sophisticated fraudsters able to hack into the digital vaults to steal them from their owners.

A study by Whitestream, an Israeli-based blockchain analytics firm, regarded Nigeria’s commercial hub as the ‘Focal Point’ for Africa’s crypto scams.

The research indicated that many scammers create a persona of luxurious life achieved from the wealth created with cryptocurrency investments into attract unsuspecting victims.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had barred commercial banks and other financial institutions from transacting with cryptocurrency in fear of the risks it poses to investments and the economy at large.

In justifying the essence of the ban, Osita Nwanisobi, CBN Acting Director of Communications, in a statement in February, explained that cryptocurrencies transaction was devoid of proper regulation and prone to financial crimes in the country.

The apex bank said the its decision is based on “significant risks that transacting in cryptocurrencies portend – risks of loss of investments, money laundering, terrorism financing, illicit fund flows and criminal activities.”","('https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2021/08/U.S.-flag.jpg',)",none

While discussing the financial stability of green investments and cyber security threats, Raghuram Rajan, Former Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that cryptocurrency will not be the last resort in a doomsday scenario. ''I would be much more confident about the value of these cryptos once they find proper use cases, such as an effective means of payment, especially in cross-border transactions,'' said Mr Rajan in an interview with news agency Reuters.

The comments from the top economist come at a time when leading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum have recently witnessed a rebound against the US dollar, after months of registering an incessant decline in prices. The recent surge in crypto prices has strengthened investor sentiment as people have recovered losses in digital currencies after several months.

Mr Rajan, who earlier served as the Chief Economist and Director of Research at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that central banks should now focus on the financial stability of green investments, and other ''threats'' such as crypto currencies and cyber security.

, and others. These digital token identifiers (DITs) will launch in September.

The underlying aim of these tokens is to add legitimacy to cryptocurrencies using norms from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Come September, digital tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum and others will be taking one of their biggest steps towards legitimacy. Digital token identifiers () are being launched to track the movement of cryptocurrencies as per the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). And, the hope that this will put into place one level of quality for all cryptocurrencies to follow.How successful this endeavour will be, however, is a different story and entirely uncertain.A company called Etrading Software, which provides market infrastructure for crypto trading , has formed a non-profit organisation called the DTI Foundation, is the one working on creating identification for cryptocurrencies.DTIs, or Digital Token Identifiers, will be akin to unique identifiers placed on assets on regular fiat currency-based trading markets — like stocks and derivatives. This allows regulators and others to track assets, identify them and quantify risks involved in trading.The DTI Foundation aims to do the same for the crypto market, which has often been criticised for its volatile nature and role in facilitating illicit transactions.According to a report by Reuters, the DTIs will be registered with the Foundation and it will use norms from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to be finalized by September this year. It will formally issue identifiers for the 100 most important crypto assets and tokens, aiming to cover over 80% of the market. This, of course, will include top coins like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple, Dogecoin and more.The DTI Foundation hasn’t really explained how these identifiers will work at the moment, which is something that will need clarification. Crypto transactions are inherently trackable too, thanks to the nature of blockchains.However, using ISO standards could mean that it will be easier for organisations, regulators and legacy platforms to get into the space, since they already have technology for such tracking built into their systems.“Currently, the same digital token can have multiple identifiers. The DTI standard will work for industry to identify crypto asset trades to improve transparency and efficiency. It is expected standardisation could help investors that operate at scale and consequently manage large operations groups to process crypto-asset transactions without having to significantly rework their existing systems and processes,” the statement said.According to the company, the DTI initiative will be led by the Product Advisory Committee ( PAC ) which will meet once a month. One of the first areas of focus for this industry forum is stable-coins, a priority for the DTI Service upon launch in September.The PAC will also discuss such topics as how future regulatory changes will impact the crypto-market landscape.Not only is the use case for DTI uncertain, it’s also difficult to say whether exchanges will jump on board with such a system. Having said that, crypto exchanges like WazirX, CoinDCX in India and many others globally, have often argued that their existence gives the crypto space a level of accountability that it didn’t have earlier.The PAC — which will oversee the implementation of DTIs — consists of 20 members, who represent a ‘cross section’ of crypto market participants, global institutional investors, standards bodies, academics, market infra providers and more. Which means that at least some form of involvement from the industry can be expected.The presence of standards bodies could make DTIs an integral part of regulations that various governments are formulating right now, while market participants and infra providers could build them directly into their systems.“We absolutely see there will be a regulatory mandate for reporting of digital assets and that’s driven by just the size of the digital market, which now cannot be ignored by regulators,” Danesh told Reuters. For a more in-depth discussion, come on over to Business Insider Cryptosphere — a forum where users can deep dive into all things crypto, engage in interesting discussions and stay ahead of the curve.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/85657416/digital-token-identifiers-want-to-set-the-benchmark-for-cryptocurrencies-but-the-picture-is-far-from-complete.jpg?imgsize=28226',)",none
2021-08-26,Mint,"Cryptocurrencies have a future, may become effective means of payment: Rajan",https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrencies-have-a-future-may-become-effective-means-of-payment-rajan-11629984774998.html,"Cryptocurrencies have a potential future and even though they have fluctuating values, these digital assets might find a way to become an effective means of payment, Raghuram Rajan , former Reserve Bank of India governor, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

The former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was more positive on well-regulated stablecoins. At the same time, he called for quick appropriate regulations for stablecoins.

A stablecoin is a digital currency that is linked to an underlying asset, such as a national currency like the US dollar or a precious metal like gold.

According to the Reuters report, Rajan was, however, not clear on the fundamentals that were driving the valuations of cryptocurrencies.

“Right now, in this heady environment with asset prices really picking up, many cryptos are also being valued — not so much as a means of payments — but as assets in their own right,"" Rajan, who is professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told Reuters.

Even in India, crypto currency exchanges are urging the government to define cryptocurrencies as digital assets and not as currency. As per industry experts, this would help the government address all its legitimate concerns with regards to financial risks associated with crypto.

Meanwhile, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the legislation on cryptocurrencies is awaiting Cabinet approval.

Rajan in his interaction with Reuters opined that some cryptocurrencies might find a way to become an effective means of payment despite their fluctuating values.

“Cross border payments are one area which is wide open, because of the huge transaction costs of making cross border payments,"" he said.

In India, growth-wise, the crypto industry has grown from four-five million people in 2018 to 15-20 million investors now with more than $1.5 billion invested. This has in part been driven by the superlative returns given by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether and dogecoin over the past three years.

Rajan believes that for cryptocurrency prices to keep on rising, these digital assets will need to find a proper use case.

“I think the value of cryptos has to be seen more in terms of are they going to be useful in the system going forward. Yes, some of them have value because they have value, and maybe that will persist. I'm not going to say that bitcoin is going to implode tomorrow. But I will say that I would be much more confident about the value of these cryptos once they find proper use cases, and the technology is evolving to make that happen,"" he said.

2021-08-26,Cointelegraph,London’s impact: Ethereum 2.0's staking contract becomes largest ETH holder,https://cointelegraph.com/news/london-s-impact-ethereum-2-0-s-staking-contract-becomes-largest-eth-holder,"Recently, the Ethereum network reached a new staking milestone. On Aug. 17, the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract became the single largest holder of Ether (ETH), surpassing Wrapped Ether (WETH). According to data from Etherscan, the Eth2 deposit contract now holds over 7.14 million Ether tokens, valued at $23 billion at the time of writing.

This accounts for nearly 6.1% of all Ether tokens in circulation, which means that the staking rate for Ethereum is now over 6%. The Wrapped Ether deposit contract comes in second, holding 6.97 million tokens — i.e., 5.94% of all Ether. Data from Beaconcha.in reveals that there are now 217,354 validators on the Ethereum network.

Right away, this has made Ether the third most staked cryptocurrency. According to data from Staking Rewards, the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract ranks third, just after Cardano and Solana, which have been proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains since their inception. In contrast to the $23 billion in ETH staked, there is over $26 billion worth of SOL staked and $63 billion in ADA staked on their respective networks.

Pete Humiston, manager of Kraken Intelligence — the research department of the Kraken exchange — told Cointelegraph about these different blockchains:

“Ether’s market cap is well over $350 billion: many multiples above both Solana and Cardano. SOL and ADA may well have a larger share staked compared to the 5.7% of ETH on ETH 2.0, but the sheer size of Ethereum means it is all but inevitable it will surpass both as ETH 2.0 continues apace.”

Ether staking only in nascent stage

Ether staking is already reaching milestones and is rising through the ranks, even though staking on the Ethereum network is still in its nascent stage. All the Ether currently deposited in the Eth2 deposit contract is locked and can be withdrawn only after the Beacon Chain merges into the main Ethereum network — the final stage of its transition to a PoS consensus mechanism.

Rick Delaney, senior analyst at OKEx Insights — the research team at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx — spoke with Cointelegraph regarding whether the transition could end up being slowed down. He stated:

“A few factors are likely to slow uptake, including the requirement to lock capital on the Beacon Chain, centralized staking service risk, ETH’s more expansive DApp [decentralized application] ecosystem enabling additional opportunities to generate returns and the protocol risk accompanying any major network upgrade.”

This staking milestone for Ethereum comes on the heels of a major event in the transformation of the blockchain, the London hard fork. The London upgrade went live on the network on Aug. 5, bringing in the highly anticipated Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, along with four other EIPs: EIP-3554, EIP-3541, EIP-3198 and EIP-3529.

EIP-1559 brought a change in the transaction pricing mechanism that eventually reduced the inflation rate of the token and decreased miners’ revenues from transaction fees. This upgrade is the penultimate step leading to the final merge of the Eth1 and Eth2 chains scheduled for 2022.

Related: Ethereum’s London hard fork sets ETH on a more deflationary path

Humiston mentioned that the reduction in ETH’s inflation makes it a much more scarce asset than it would have been otherwise. The inflation schedule will change yet again once the final transformation to PoS takes place. He said:

“If the ETH burned offsets that issued under PoS, ETH will become a deflationary asset. Should demand stay at current levels, then we can assume that the price of ETH will likely rise, all else remaining constant.”

This price increase could lead to a positive feedback loop, as a higher price could give a push to innovation and development within the ecosystem, which would then lead to greater network usage and entail that even more ETH is burned under this EIP. In addition to the reduction in selling pressure on ETH over the short- to mid-term leading to higher ETH prices, there are other aspects that need to be considered.

Delaney pointed out that miners currently sell ETH to cover their electricity and hardware costs, but once the network is entirely secured by stakers, even the miners will be incentivized to hoard ETH. He said, “Meanwhile, network users’ ETH will disappear from circulation via 1559’s burn mechanism. While the resulting supply shock will likely send ETH to the proverbial moon, it may have a centralizing effect on the network’s validator structure and wealth concentration.”

CEO of on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, mentioned in a tweet that a sell-side “liquidity crisis” could push ETH past Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of price. Cointelegraph discussed this with Andrew Keys, founder of ConsenSys Capital and co-founder managing partner of Darma Capital, who acknowledged that while there will be a supply reduction, “to call it a ‘liquidity crisis’ might be overstating it.” He further stated:

“That reduction in the supply of the token, coupled with Ethereum’s greater scalability and its larger developer community should lead to the price of ETH eclipsing the price of BTC in the next 24 months.”

The flippening narrative

In the aftermath of the London upgrade, in addition to the increased interest witnessed in the Eth2 staking contract, the price of the token also has seen huge gains. In the past week, ETH has posted 10.58% gains and in the past month has posted 51.80% gains. This surpassed the 42% gains Bitcoin has over the last 30 days.

This incremental difference in price appreciation has brought back the “flippening” narrative to the conscience of the cryptoverse. Nigel Green, CEO and founder of the deVere Group — one of the world’s largest independent financial consulting organizations — has stated that he expects ETH to continue to outperform BTC over the remainder of the year. He also mentioned that within the next five years, the value of Ether will exceed that of Bitcoin, adding, “Ethereum’s ascent to the top of the cryptoverse seems unstoppable.”

Coinbase’s second-quarter earnings release recently revealed that the volume of ETH traded on the platform has surpassed BTC for the first time in the nine years — since the inception of the platform. Even one of the most prominent cryptocurrency hardware wallets, Ledger, has announced the integration of an accessible staking option through Ledger Live, which could lead to higher retail levels of interest in staking on the network, thus feeding into the frenzy about Ethereum as a whole, a dynamic usually reserved for Bitcoin.

Delaney further spoke on the possibilities of a flippening event. He said, “Given their respective use cases today — BTC as a store of value and ETH being required to interact with smart contracts — it seems likely that ETH trading volume will eventually surpass BTC.” In addition to trading, DApp service consumers would need to purchase ETH to interact with them. This is a stark contrast, as most of the BTC supply still sits in cold storage. He added:

“Efforts like the Lido integration with Ledger make staking Ethereum more attractive to those concerned about centralized staking service risks and fees, capital lockup requirements, technical barriers to entry and security. These factors, combined with the fact that users can stake less than the 32 ETH required to run an independent validating node, should see staking participation grow.”

The rise in total value locked (TVL) across decentralized finance (DeFi) apps and the nonfungible token (NFT) boom provide evidence of strong Ethereum usage. According to data from DappRadar, the TVL in DeFi spiked 19% from the pre-hard fork levels near $102 billion on Aug. 4 to currently standing at $122.6 billion. This usage could increase even more if the ongoing network transition successfully reduces the gas price and increases scalability as intended.

Keys commented that Ethereum leads Bitcoin in every metric apart from market capitalization and trading volumes and that it’s only a matter of time before ETH surpasses BTC in those metrics too. He added, “The Ethereum ecosystem is the largest ecosystem supporting blockchain applications, with 95% of all blockchain-based applications built there.”

Whether ETH will flip BTC in the short term remains to be seen, but Ethereum 2.0 could trigger a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, even from traditional financial markets. As revealed in a JPMorgan Chase report, Ethereum could take its staking yields to $20 billion by 2022 and to $40 billion by 2025. This is yet another encouraging sign that reinforces the sustained demand for Ethereum.","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDgvNTQ5NmZiZDQtN2IwMy00NDRhLWFjMmYtMzZlZDA0MDI0ZDZhLmpwZw==.jpg',)",none

NEW DELHI: Cryptocurrency trading is a lucrative investment option for people and also contributes to the growth of the economy. But the one downside of crypto trading is its vulnerability to hacking. Let’s take a look at some crucial facts related to major cyber thefts in the crypto world.Since 2018 there have been five major security breaches with a total of $2021 million swindled by hackers, a BBC report says.In 2018, two major crypto heists took place, where $146m was lifted from the Italian exchange BitGrail affecting 2,30,000 investors and $534 million was hacked from the Japanese exchange Coincheck. In the case of Coincheck , the affected investors were reimbursed.Moving forward to 2020, $281 million was lifted from KuCoin by Korean hackers from the Seychelles-based exchange. However, the company managed to recover the stolen funds and refunded their customers.In the year 2021, the greatest crypto heist took place with $610 million being hacked from the PolyNetwork, a DeFi platform in August.However, this is the only heist where the hacker returned all the assets, enabling the exchange to reimburse the asset holders. This was followed by another major crypto heist worth $97 million in Japan’s Liquid exchange on August 19.In all the above major crypto heists, the vulnerability points were the cause. Some exchanges have plugged the security loopholes, but hackers keep finding new ways to compromise the system.There are exchanges which are basically websites that have inbuilt safekeeping vaults with digital blind doors, locks and keys and many more security features which are all blocks of information. But in recent times their safety has become questionable because they have been compromised in some instances.In the case of the PolyNetwork hack earlier this month, the exchange had sent a letter to the hacker asking him to return the assets as they belonged to members.PolyNetwork even offered $500,000 and immunity as a reward for returning the assets. This has raised questions if private companies had the authority to promise immunity from criminal prosecution.In the United States, the FBI has already opined that private companies cannot give immunity, while in India, which is emerging as one of the top cryptocurrency markets, a bill to regulate cryptocurrency is taking shape.Crypto investments in India grew from $923 million to nearly $6.6 billion between April 2020 and May 2021. Hackers will continue to exploit vulnerability points even in the future. It is the need of the hour to make vaults more secure, cyber safety experts sayThe crypto asset market has grown into hundreds of millions of dollars. The transactions, transfers and safekeeping are to the tune of billions and need regulations either lawful or self-imposed regulations in a group of exchanges.Seth Melamed, CEO of the Liquid Global exchange tweeted “There will be zero hair cuts. More announcements are coming soon. Again, this has been a humbling and painful experience but there will be no loss of customer funds”. Zero haircut is referred to as the return of money in terms of asset management.The BBC report quotes financial analyst Frances Coppola as saying that cryptocurrency organisations must learn from their security breaches and infuse more security features into their systems.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85656952,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-162864,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

SEC

A US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official labelled crypto frauds the ""flavour of the year"" at a virtual seminar on consumer fraud on Wednesday.

Fraudsters use attractive industries like cryptocurrency to attract victims, according to Peter Diskin, an assistant regional director at the SEC's Atlanta office.

Microsoft

Microsoft has been granted a patent in the United States for software that it claims can assist users in developing blockchain applications by enabling the creation of crypto tokens for various distributed ledgers quicker and more efficiently.

Due to a lack of consistency across multiple blockchains, producing and managing tokens is now ""complex and tedious,"" according to the patent.

AriseCoin

Jared Rice, Sr., the inventor of AriseCoin, was sentenced to five years in federal prison for his role in a $4.25 million Ponzi scheme.

Rice, 33, was also the CEO of AriseBank, the world's ""first decentralised banking platform,"" according to the company's website.

Vechain

VeChain, a supply chain management platform, has launched a new tool that will help organisations combine their carbon footprint data management procedures.

The new service combines decentralised ledger technology with a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, according to a Medium post published on Thursday.

2021-08-26,Bitcoin News,Spain Prepares Registry for Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Custody Providers – Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/spain-prepares-registry-for-cryptocurrency-exchanges-and-custody-providers/,"Spain Prepares Registry for Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Custody Providers

The authorities of Spain must prepare a registry of cryptocurrency exchanges and custody providers to comply with legal requirements to address transparency and terrorism financing issues. This registry is specified by the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Law, approved last year. The process, which started in April, gives these service providers until October to register.

Spain to Create Virtual Asset Provider Registry

The Bank of Spain must determine the requirements to start registering cryptocurrency exchanges and custody providers, as determined by Spanish law. The virtual asset service providers must register with the institution to implement anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing measures. This is mandated by the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Law that was approved last year.

The period established by law to allow these providers to register started in April and ends in October. After that, cryptocurrency service providers will have a second period to register that finishes in January 2022. The law states the purpose of the registry is to:

…improve the mechanisms for the prevention of terrorism and improve the transparency and availability of information about true cryptocurrency owners.

Stringent Regulations

Spain has been busy regulating cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency interactions this year, approving a series of laws that exert more control on crypto and fiat holdings. The so-called anti-fraud law, passed on July 7, establishes that Spanish citizens must disclose their cryptocurrency ownership for assets inside and outside the country. The law also states that custody providers must report information about their customers and their holdings.

The antifraud law prescribes harsh penalties for failure to disclose this information. Customer data will be available to all countries in the European Union, as well. According to Alejandro de la Cruz, a Spanish financial lawyer, the registry will mark a before and after for crypto-related service providers in Spain. This might affect the growth of cryptocurrency adoption in the region because exchanges will have to comply with a lengthy process and identity themselves and their customers to regulators.

However, part of the Spanish congress seems to understand the importance that cryptocurrencies can have in the lives of citizens. A new draft law introduced earlier this month, seeking to modernize the Spanish legal structure, would allow Spanish citizens to pay their mortgages with cryptocurrency.

2021-08-26,Cointelegraph,Will Polkadot save decentralized finance from Ethereum’s scaling problems?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-polkadot-save-decentralized-finance-from-ethereum-s-scaling-problems,"Web 3.0, interoperability and layer zero are all terms tossed around when describing Polkadot. But what do they mean, and how will they impact the internet and cryptocurrency market? Cointelegraph Research’s new report explores how Polkadot is tackling distributed ledger scalability and centralization of the web simultaneously.

For starters, imagine a world where Facebook is replaced by a decentralized social media application built on Polkadot. This is what projects like Subsocial are building in their platforms, which let users determine what data to keep private and what to share. Users can leverage their data by monetizing it on Ocean Market, retaining full control at all times, while AI researchers and data scientists can access that data without exposing it, keeping it secure from breaches.

Not happy about the bank charging overdraft fees when your account balance reaches below $0.00? Well, one Polkadot-based project called Acala has built an on-chain automatic scheduler that is similar to a decentralized version of Stripe. This enables users to automatically transfer staking rewards to their wallet address, which can be linked to a physical credit card. This means that a person can be paid for helping to secure a decentralized money and banking system and that the money they earn can be sent to a credit card and used to buy a coffee at Starbucks. Instead of spending their staking rewards, validators could trade them for other assets on decentralized exchanges like Polkadex or create collateralized debt positions on Centrifuge in order to buy tangible assets like a house.

This report covers:

How Polkadot allows blockchains with different structures to co-exist in an interoperable environment with shared security.

How the system of slot auctions allows projects to compete for the right to remain connected to the network.

How the ecosystem around Polkadot gave rise to a wide variety of decentralized products, from social networks to cloud computation and prediction markets.

Download the full report here, complete with charts and infographics

Does Polkadot deliver what Ethereum promised?

Ethereum’s consensus mechanism forces all nodes to validate all transactions. In contrast, the Polkadot blockchain breaks up batches of new transactions into many shards and processes them in parallel. The blockchains plugging into the network can have very different rules of operation, transaction processing and capabilities, giving the whole system much more flexibility.

Polkadot is trying to achieve scalability without decreasing the network’s security. This famous problem, known as the “blockchain trilemma,” was elucidated by one of Ethereum’s co-founders, Vitalik Buterin himself.

In contrast with Ethereum’s single blockchain design, Polkadot has many different blockchains, called parachains, that plug into one main blockchain, which is also referred to as the Relay Chain or layer zero. Similar to the hub-and-spoke model commonly used in airport design, connecting disparate blockchains via the central Relay Chain establishes a way to send messages and transactions across multiple blockchains without slowing down traffic on the transaction highway. Layer zero refers to the concept that layer-one protocols, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, could be spokes and Polkadot could be the hub. For example, the nonfungible token project Bit.Country is a Substrate-based blockchain that uses a bridge with Ethereum. This enables assets to flow between Ethereum and metaverses built on Bit.Country’s TEWAI blockchain.

No smart contracts on Polkadot

Since Polkadot’s Relay Chain does not have smart contracts, it’s up to the blockchains plugged into Polkadot to enable smart contracts. For example, one parachain called Moonbeam has full compatibility with Ethereum contracts. Moonbeam’s developers have created a way to interact with digital currencies built on Polkadot via MetaMask, the popular web browser wallet for decentralized finance. This means that tokens built on Polkadot’s Substrate, which is a blockchain development tool, can be seamlessly sent to Ethereum wallets and smart contract addresses.

The next layer of the Polkadot ecosystem includes projects building on top of the blockchains that are built on top of the Relay Chain. For example, Ocean Protocol is in the process of deploying its smart contracts onto the Moonbeam blockchain. By building on top of Moonbeam, the OCEAN token will be compatible with both Polkadot and Ethereum blockchain applications.

Rebuilding Ethereum’s network on Polkadot

The improved scalability of Polkadot enables many projects to overcome Etheruem’s high transaction fees and the low number of transactions per second. Similar to Ethereum’s decentralized data storage projects such as Filecoin, Sia or Storj, Crust Network is building a similar solution on top of Polkadot. Unlike Ethereum-based projects, Crust Network isn’t constrained by Ethereum’s scalability problems. Many of the applications we have come to love on Ethereum are being rebuilt on the Polkadot network or integrated via chain-agnostic gateways.

The Polkadot ecosystem is brimming with projects ranging from decentralized cloud computing with Phala Network to cross-chain custodial wallets such as the browser-based MathWallet. The hardware-based virtual private network project Deeper Network has already sold over 10,000 physical devices on Indiegogo, Amazon and BestBuy. Deeper’s blockchain solution coordinates all devices and routing in a privacy-preserving way, holds the device registry (in the form of public-key infrastructure), and manages staking and reputation subsystems.","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDgvMmE4NmU1OTUtYmMxYy00YmVhLTg2ZjAtZTgxMzg2NzMyYjg0LmpwZw==.jpg',)",none

Arbitrage involves trading one cryptocurrency for another, or trading the same cryptocurrency on different exchanges. This method is preferred by people who are accustomed to day trading, and have an even higher appetite for risk than those who are simply day trading.

Being a hands-on trader reveals many imbalances in the market, and thus opportunities for profit each day.

For example, let’s assume XYZ coin is priced at ₹10 on one exchange and at ₹11 on the second. A person could then buy ten XYZ coins on the first exchange at ₹100, transfer the coin to the second exchange, and then sell the cryptocurrency for ₹110.

The absolute gain would seem to be ₹10. However, transaction costs could eat away as much as ₹8 and leave investors with a profit of only ₹2.

This is similar to how investors play fiat currencies against each other in traditional currency markets.

There could be more complex routes, such as transferring value between three currencies on the same exchange, to end up with a larger quantity of the first currency. This is usually done when the value of newer cryptocurrencies rises or falls considerably within minutes.

In other instances, ‘stablecoins’ whose value remains ‘tethered’ to specific national currencies – like Tether (USDT) which will remain at 1 USD – may be useful to benefit from imbalanced prices.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/85653413/Cryptocurrency-isnt-for-everyone-but-heres-how-some-are-using-digital-tokens-to-make-money.jpg',)",none

Bill Gurley has taken a personal position in ethereum, he told Bloomberg.

The venture capitalist was won over by the crypto's practical and flexible community.

Gurley said he isn't a crypto maximalist and wouldn't argue that people need to own crypto.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Venture capitalist Bill Gurley is personally betting on ethereum's success after the cryptocurrency network's community won him over.

""I have to say I was swayed by the arguments of the ethereum crowd,"" he told Bloomberg in an interview on Wednesday. ""And so, I've taken a personal position - not something to Benchmark.""

Gurley, a general partner at Silicon Valley VC firm Benchmark, didn't specify how much he invested. Ethereum fans impressed him because they struck him as ""way more pragmatic"" than others in the crypto space, he said.

""They seem to be open to change and are basically making several changes which I think will bring down fees and will be very beneficial,"" he said, referring to the network's shift to ethereum 2.0 which is said to be more scalable, sustainable, and secure. ""The developer community is clearly in the ethereum camp.""

""I think there's a ESG benefit once they move to proof-of-stake versus bitcoin,"" he added, referring to environmental, social, and governance factors. ""It seems to me to be the smarter way to play if you're going to have crypto exposure.""

Ethereum's move to a proof-of-stake protocol is said to be far less energy intensive than proof-of-work, which is what bitcoin uses to validate and confirm transactions. Some analysts expect ESG investors to embrace ether's dramatically improved energy consumption, making it the more dominant token.

However, Gurley said he isn't a crypto maximalist and wouldn't argue that everyone should have exposure to digital coins.

The legendary investor, who has previously called out Robinhood's reliance on payment for order flow, reiterated his critical view of the commission-free trading app's business model.

PFOF is ""a bastardization of our markets and I hope the SEC makes it go away,"" he said, adding that he sees Robinhood as more of a casino than an investor platform. Gurley has said he didn't invest in Robinhood because it made him feel ""emotionally bad.""

Cryptocurrency prices continue to fall as high volatility prevailed in the virtual coin market over the past 24 hours.

Crypto prices started falling after Monday’s trading session due to heavy profit-booking, and have remained weak since then. Experts believe volatility in crypto trade is also a result of monthly options expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, is trading slightly below $47,000, down 2.95 per cent at 12:07 pm. The virtual coin’s market capitalisation has fallen sharply to $882 billion.

It may be noted that Bitcoin had touched a high of $50,000 on Monday and its market capitalisation has inched closer to $950 billion.

Ether’s (ETH) value has also eroded sharply over the past 24 hours. It was trading at $3,109, down over 3 per cent compared to its value 24 hours ago. Ether’s market capitalisation has fallen to $363 billion.

All other altcoins also lost ground, trading 3-8 per cent lower due to the selloff observed over the past 24 hours.

Commenting on the cryptocurrency market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The crypto markets were highly volatile over the past 24 hours. Such volatility is often encountered before the monthly options expiry.”

With the help of automated cryptocurrency mining technology, anybody can become a miner.

Despite the so-called volatility in the cryptocurrency market, digital currency adoption is expanding like never before. 2021 has seen a massive number of new crypto investors crawling from the dark and adding value to the digital currency market. Although most of them faced severe price fall when bitcoin almost reached a death cross, the hype for cryptocurrency is not dying. More and more tech experts are jumping into cryptocurrency mining to get their hands on big benefits. However, for laymen, cryptocurrency mining has been a dream for a long time. Fortunately, not anymore. Yes, with the help of automated cryptocurrency mining technology, anybody can become a miner.

Cryptocurrency mining is the process by which new digital currencies are entered into circulation. It is a critical component of the maintenance and development of the blockchain ledger. In most cases, cryptocurrency mining is performed using sophisticated computers that solve extremely complex computational math problems. The miners should solve critical encryptions or computer puzzles to obtain bitcoin rewards. However, every time a coin is obtained in this manner, the encryption algorithm becomes more complex. This means each new coin mining requires a higher amount of computing power and math knowledge to break it. Initially, bitcoin mining felt very easy as the problems were simple. But as more coins were mined, the complexity grew and at a certain point, only tech-savvy can solve the encryption. Fortunately, technology is coming for crypto enthusiasts’ rescue. The digital trend is introducing a new concept called ‘automated cryptocurrency mining’ to streamline the mining process without human intervention. Besides, cryptocurrency mining software providers are also mushrooming like never before, shining a spotlight on the growing importance of automating cryptocurrency mining.

Mechanism Behind Automated Cryptocurrency Mining

As the most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been experiencing high adoption in recent years. Along with the bitcoin price rally, bitcoin mining also became famous among crypto enthusiasts. Although bitcoin mining is a behind the scene process of creating the digital currency, it has attracted many individuals’ interest over years.

Owing to its necessity, the cryptocurrency mining process as a whole is becoming automatic. However, there is a complex mechanism in bitcoin mining that puts the cryptocurrency at loss. Some estimates suggest that thousands or even tens of thousands of bitcoins are lost forever due to the way bitcoin wallets are set up. In order to combat this, miners should pick up the most profitable algorithm and solve it. But humans can’t do predictions in real-time. Therefore, automated cryptocurrency mining emerges as a handy solution to combat bitcoin mining loss. Automated cryptocurrency mining can select the high-profit algorithm for miners to streamline the cryptocurrency mining process. It also keeps track of the connection between miners and the mining pool. A rough estimate suggests that automated cryptocurrency mining can effectively maximize the mining profit by increasing 21% when compared with the original algorithm.

The Emergence of Cryptocurrency Mining Software

Since not every cryptocurrency miner has the luxury to opt for automated cryptocurrency mining solutions, some go for cryptocurrency mining software that comes with a handful of benefits. The cryptocurrency mining software uses computing power in order to mine cryptocurrency. As most of the functionalities are automated, one doesn’t need technical skills to use them. It avails computer graphics processing unit (GPU) to facilitate the discovery of blocks. There is a plethora of cryptocurrency mining software available today.

ECOS: Incarcerated in 2017, ECOS is one of the best cloud mining solutions available in the market. Fortunately, this is the first cloud mining provider that is operating with legal status. Despite being a front-running cryptocurrency mining software provider, ECOS is also a wallet, exchange, investment portfolios, and savings platform.

CGMiner: With a myriad of futuristic tools and features and active community support, CGMiner is one of the best bitcoin mining software in the market. CGMiner is a command-line application that has full monitoring, fan speed control, and remote interface capabilities.

Cudo Miner: Cudo Miner is easy to install, secure to use, and safe on your hardware solutions that also help earn money through cryptocurrency mining. The platform offers auto coin switching to maximize profit. It provides setting and control to adjust GPU speed and performing optimization.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency-mining.jpg',)",none

Bitcoin on Wednesday climbed above $69,000 for the first time since May.

With the cryptocurrency back in vogue Tim Loh, an assistant commissioner with the Australian Taxation Office, issued a warning to those hoping to hide their wealth.

'The ATO matches cryptocurrency to individuals' tax returns helping us ensure investors are paying the right amount of tax,' he said.

'We estimate that over 600,000 taxpayers have invested in crypto assets in recent years.'

The tax office has issued a stern warning to Australia's 600,000 cryptocurrency investors who think their Bitcoin wealth is untraceable. Bitcoin on Wednesday climbed above $69,000 for the first time since May (pictured is a stock image)

Like share investors, those who buy and sell cryptocurrency have to pay a capital gains tax if they make a profit and this must be declared on a tax return.

Cryptocurrencies, like shares, are also increasingly being bought over exchange platforms that provide data to the tax office.

But peer-to-peer trades between individuals are harder to track unless the tax office obtains records from phone companies.

Bitcoin has had a volatile year, climbing above $80,000 in March when billionaire Tesla chief Elon Musk announced he had bought $US1.5billion of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency and would accept it as payment for his electric cars.

It then dived to $45,000 by May after he changed his mind on the grounds mining cryptocurrencies with complex mathematical formulas used too many fossil fuels.

In early August Fred Schebesta, the millionaire co-founder of the Finder comparison website, was predicting Bitcoin would reach $61,000 by the end of 2021.

But with Bitcoin on Thursday worth $67,000 Mr Schebesta, a cryptocurrency investor, updated his forecast to have the cryptocurrency hitting $87,000 by Christmas, and still reaching $338,000 by 2025.

'Bitcoin going up in value is great. But what's better is when Bitcoin goes up in value slowly because it shows strength,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

With the cryptocurrency back in vogue Tim Loh, an assistant commissioner with the Australian Taxation Office, issued a warning to those hoping to hide their wealth

'When it goes up too fast it means it's going to potentially come crashing back.

'Whereas this run up has been really nice and slow and considered.

'This shows extreme strength, for me, and I think this will create a real strong base for Bitcoin to go much much, much higher.'

Mr Schebesta said other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, used for business transactions, were now pulling up Bitcoin as bargain hunters looked for alternatives before coming back to Bitcoin.

'When Etherium ran up, it pulled Bitcoin up for the first time, which I think is a really interesting new pattern where other coins can also pull Bitcoin up where in the past, Bitcoin was the one that pulled everything else up,' he said.

In early August Fred Schebesta, the millionaire co-founder of the Finder comparison website, was predicting Bitcoin would reach $61,000 by the end of 2021.

'Think of the stock market. If the two biggest stocks suddenly go up, then everyone looks at the other stocks and thinks they now look pretty cheap relative to them.

'So everyone buys the other stocks as well. So that's what started happening, the second biggest stock started really rallying, and then the first one looked cheap.'

Ethereum on Thursday was worth $4,300, still a fraction of Bitcoin's $67,000.

Australians have until October 31 to lodge their tax return if they are doing it themselves or have until May 15 next year if they are going through a tax accountant.

Those working from home can claim a flat 80 cents an hour rate on their tax return for the last financial year, ending on June 30, or use the lower 52-cent rate and manually add up their phone, internet and electricity expenses.

Mr Loh said the tax office was this year targeting cryptocurrency investors and those who overclaimed on their work-from-home expenses.

'This year, we're focused on work-related expenses including working from home, income and deductions for rental properties and capital gains tax on cryptocurrency, shares and property,' he said.","('https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/04/47113391-0-image-a-12_1629949990438.jpg',)",none

The world’s largest crypotcurrency was trading at $48,373, up 0.43 per cent at the time of this article. The cryptocurrency on Monday surged to $50,000, which happened for the first time after the crash that happened in May this year. In April, the world biggest currency Bitcoin surged and hit an all-time high at $65,000. Bitcoin has risen and recovered after hovering in the range of $30,000 to $40,000 for many weeks. Bitcoin steeply fell from $65,000 in April to $28,800 in June, after a massive sell-off in June and July, triggered by Chinese ban on the corporates, financial companies, payment companies, providing services related to cryptocurrency.

This week two announcements made by Paypal and Coinbase pulled up the Bitcoin around $50,000 mark.

According to Zebpay trade desk, Bitcoin has touched the $50,000 mark for the first time since May and has surged almost by 72 per cent from its recent low of $29,301. Technically on the weekly time frame, the asset is trading in an uptrend forming a ‘Higher Highs Higher Lows’ pattern. BTC may face some resistance around $51,109 levels (61.8 per cent Fibonacci Retracement Level) and if these levels are breached with good volumes then we can expect the asset to further rally up to $57,000.

On the other hand, Ether, the rival currency of Bitcoin was trading at $3166 or down 0.86 per cent at the time of this article. It was trading up 5.97 per cent over the last week.

Binance Coin stood at $501.72, up 4.09 per cent over the past 24 hours. The Binance Coin was trading up 26.41 per cent over the last week. The market cap for Binance Coin stood at $85.5 billion.

The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $112.54B, which makes a 5.19 per cent decrease. The total volume in DeFi is currently $15.72B, 13.97 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins is now $88.73B, which is 78.84 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per the Coinmarketcap.com.

“The cryptocurrency spectrum kept searching for a sturdy support. Bitcoin hovered above the $48,000 level, allowing bears to enter the markets. Despite a minor correction, there is no reason to fret. The bulk of the activity is in the derivatives market as over $1.7 billion worth of contracts will expire in the next two days. Long-term investors should choose to ignore such noise in the crypto markets. Markets would look to find support towards the end of this month,"" Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder, Mudrex- A Global Crypto Trading Platform said.

This had given a “left behind” feeling to investors of Bitcoin. But now Bitcoin is flexing its muscles again.The price of the numero uno digital token by market cap has once again hit the $50,000 mark, delivering more than 70 per cent returns from its recent lows of $29,000. Ethereum has risen about 80 per cent to $3,300 from $1,850.This strong tussle between the two has again started off a debate among investors over which one is more valuable. Despite a sharp rise in altcoins, the fancy over crypto behemoths has not fizzled out completely.Sharan Nair, Chief Business Officer of CoinSwitch Kuber, said Ethereum has seen a surge in pricing due to a lot of DeFi projects going on around it. However, analysts said the recent update has limited the supply of Ethereum, which led to the sharp movement in the token. But it can not dethrone Bitcoin.Siddharth Menon, COO of WazirX, said Ethereum may outperform Bitcoin in returns but not in market cap. ""Bitcoin will still hold the largest share and will remain dominant,"" he added.Ethereum is now getting a scarcity premium as the London Hard Fork update has led to deflation. On the contrary, the oldest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has limited supply; not more than 21 million Bitcoins can be mined.""Ethereum doesn't have an explicit supply cap. But if a shortage happens, I am hoping that we will see a surge in pricing. It is the basic demand and supply rule,"" said Nair.Menon of Wazir X did not give any personal advice.Supply shock has been aiding the upward movement in Bitcoin historically, and that may now push Ethereum prices higher. However, analysts can not pick one over the other, thanks to strong fundamentals, well-defined useage and outperformance over the years. They are bullish on both the tokens.

2021-08-26,NDTV.com,5 Different Types Of Cryptocurrencies And Their Importance,https://www.ndtv.com/business/5-cryptocurrencies-and-their-importance-2518509,"Blockchains are advanced computer networks that are created using mathematics and coding

Cryptocurrency has become a common point of discussion in most finance-related conversations. The digital currency has slowly begun to gain acceptance in global markets as an alternate mode of payment to fiat currency. For the unversed, cryptocurrency is a type of electronic money that is managed using blockchain technology. Blockchains are advanced computer networks that are created using mathematics and coding. Unlike fiat currencies that are issued by governments and regulated by banking authorities, cryptocurrency is completely decentralised and is not issued or regulated by any government or authority.

Cryptocurrencies are divided into coins and tokens. Coins operate on their own blockchain and hold value as they are used as money for transactions. Tokens, on the other hand, are built on an existing blockchain.

Here is a list of the 5 popular cryptocurrencies. For live prices of cryptocurrencies, click here.

1) Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency in the world. It was created in 2009. It is the first decentralised cryptocurrency that facilitated transactions using its own blockchain technology. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was priced at roughly Rs. 37.34 lakhs.

2) Ethereum

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency network that uses blockchain technology to facilitate smart contracts. It is a decentralised software that allows smart contracts to be built on its network and run on it without any control or fear of fraud by a third party. Ether is the token used to enable transactions on the Ethereum network. Ethereum is currently priced at roughly Rs. 2.46 lakhs.

3) Dogecoin

This cryptocurrency was created using a popular meme that features a Shiba Inu dog as its icon. The meme was immensely popular as is the cryptocurrency whose price skyrocketed after receiving backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Musk managed to shake up the already volatile crypto market by backing the meme coin. Dogecoin, unlike Bitcoin, has no limit on the number of coins that can be mined. It's is currently priced at Rs. 22.49.

4) Cardano

Cardano was created through a research-based approach by a team of mathematicians, engineers, and cryptographers. In the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies, Cardano claims to be a more sustainable and balanced coin when compared to the other cryptocurrencies. It is currently priced at Rs. 210.78.

5) Litecoin (LTC)

It was created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, a graduate from MIT and an engineer at Google. It was one of the first few cryptocurrencies that followed the same technology as Bitcoin. Despite being modeled on Bitcoin, Litecoin generates blocks at a faster rate, and, hence, offers a faster transaction time. It is currently priced at Rs. 13,631.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-02/kq34jumk_cryptocurrency-bitcoin-reuters_625x300_11_February_21.jpg',)",none

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization broke above $50,000 level earlier this week for the first time since mid-May. Bitcoin is up 68% this year (year-to-date), though, far away from its record just below $65,000 in April.

As per CoinDesk, Bitcoin prices were trading higher at $49,020, up more than 2%. Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, surged to $3,224, up 1%. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was trading with gains of 0.5% at $0.29. Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also gained over the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrency funds saw their first inflows in seven weeks as investors poured money into altcoins such as ether, cardano, and Solana last week, according to a report by digital-asset manager CoinShares.

Digital asset funds saw net inflows of $21 million last week. However, during the six-week period, the longest losing streak since January 2018, digital asset investment products saw total redemption of $115 million.

However, bitcoin saw its seventh straight week of outflows, as investors took out $2.8 million from funds based on the world’s biggest cryptocurrency during last week. Ether saw minor inflows totalling $3.2 million last week along with other altcoins such as cardano, litecoin and polkadot, which saw inflows of $6.4 million, $1.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Later, supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped the Bitcoin rally.

2021-08-26,Cointelegraph,DeFi TVL hits a record $157B as Ethereum competitors attract investors,https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-tvl-hits-a-record-157b-as-ethereum-competitors-attract-investors,"Altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens have been on a tear for the last two weeks and, as the end of August approaches, many projects are seeing their tokens reach all-time highs.

Data shows that a majority of the top-10 DeFi tokens gained more than 20% in the past 30-days, with projects like Bancor (BNT) and THORChain (RUNE) seeing gains in excess of 115%.

Top 10 DeFi assets by price. Source: Messari

Here’s a look at some of the factors behind the current boost to DeFi tokens and the projects that are leading the way in terms of protocol upgrades and cross-chain interoperability.

Total value locked reaches a new all-time high

Data from DeFi Llama shows that the total value locked (TVL) in all DeFi protocols reached an all-time high at $157.06 billion on Aug. 22, and many analysts believe TVL is one of the best measures of sentiment within the DeFi ecosystem.

Total value locked in DeFi. Source: DeFi Llama

During the previous run-up, the TVL reaching an all-time high coincided with the surging prices of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), both of which reached their all-time highs around the same time.

This time around, Bitcoin and Ether are more than 24% below their all-time highs, yet the TVL in DeFi has surpassed its previous record.

This suggests that popular DeFi-related tokens with a multi-faceted utility within the crypto and DeFi ecosystem have attracted investors' attention. Typically, Uniswap (UNI) and SushiSwap (SUSHI) lead among DeFi tokens, but a few other strong gainers this week include a 22% increase for Convex Finance and a 17.84% increase from PancakeSwap.

New protocols attract attention

The past three months have also seen the arrival of popular new DeFi protocols like DinoSwap and the rise of Ethereum-network competitors, like Avalanche (AVAX), that have brought fresh energy and funds to the DeFi ecosystem.

$500M In TVL!

We are very grateful to the @0xPolygon community and all of our partners for helping us achieve this huge milestone so quickly. The @DinoSwapHQ team is working hard everyday to continue expanding and providing the best farming experience. Onwards! pic.twitter.com/4h4hrSPKN4 — DinoSwap (@DinoSwapHQ) July 31, 2021

DinoSwap and Avalanche have benefited from users fleeing the high fees on the Ethereum network due to the reduced transaction costs and faster processing times through their cross-chain bridges.

Avalanche launched its ‘Avalanche Rush’ DeFi incentive program on Aug. 18, which has brought a flurry of activity to the protocols involved, including Aave, Curve and SushiSwap. This liquidity mining event has proven quite popular and has helped to lift its native AVAX token back above $50 for the first time since February.

In the first half of the year, DeFi tokens rallied early and were followed by a surge in the price of NFTs and NFT-related assets. As summer draws to a close and NFTs notch new eye-watering record sales and volumes each day, it's possible that a sector rotation could occur soon and the DeFi sector may be warming up for a run of its own.

2021-08-26,The Hill,Cryptocurrency makes the climate crisis worse,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/569395-cryptocurrency-makes-the-climate-crisis-worse,"Cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin in particular, is always in the news nowadays and is becoming a significant factor in modern financial markets. Unsurprisingly, the subject of regulating cryptocurrency in one form or another has become an important concern. China is already restricting its use. Central banks around the world are looking at decentralized cryptocurrencies to assess their potential impact on financial stability, or to even issue their own digital currencies. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler Gary GenslerClimate hawks pressure Biden to replace Fed chair On The Money — Job gains fall below estimates Wall Street regulator eyes increase in disclosure for 'green' fund managers MORE described crypto trading as the “Wild West” recently calling for Congress to create a protection regime for crypto investors. A major impasse for the critical infrastructure bill was the issue of taxing crypto transactions. Others have proposed that “stablecoins” be regulated like banks.

Unsurprisingly, the crypto industry has developed a formidable lobbying force to ward off further regulation. Regulation is totally antithetical to the very idea of decentralized cryptocurrency.

Yet, little focus has gone to the environmental dangers of cryptocurrency. Yes, Elon Musk Elon Reeve MuskRussia's space chief jealous of Musk and Bezos: 'Our millionaires prefer to invest more in yachts' How will Biden's Afghanistan debacle impact NASA's Artemis return to the moon? Elon Musk after Texas Gov.

Cryptocurrency’s impact on the environment is indeed very serious — possibly the single most important policy factor against its growth.

Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum in particular, are so damaging to the environment that they threaten to reverse any gains achieved through the transition to electric vehicles and the reduction in fossil fuels use. Much of this consumption and output derives from the energy and processing intensive “mining” of Bitcoin and “proofs of work.” Even now the total Bitcoin carbon footprint exceeds the total emission reductions of electric vehicles. According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Bitcoin already consumes more energy than the whole of Argentina (pop. 45 million).

Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates that Bitcoin and Ethereum together consume the same amount of power as Ukraine and Israel, totaling 52 million people. The carbon footprint of a single Bitcoin transactions equates to nearly 2 million Visa transactions, or 135,229 hours of watching YouTube! A single Ethereum transaction consumes the equivalent power used by an average U.S. household over 4.55 days. Furthermore, the energy and carbon footprints of both these and other cryptocurrencies are projected to grow exponentially in volume as speculation, hype and criminality continue to drive volume. Already, total crypto energy consumption “is roughly comparable to the carbon emissions produced by the metropolitan area of London,” according to The Gaurdian.

Apart from these staggering energy consumption statistics, crypto is also intensifying competition for chips, for which there is already a global shortage impeding the manufacture of alternative energy devices, including EVs. Crypto has already grown exponentially. Further growth will only broaden its carbon footprint.

Given the daunting targets for carbon reduction that we face in the U.S. and globally, this development should concern everyone. If there were offsetting gains with crypto, one might justify it on a cost-benefit basis, as we do with EVs (which inflict some damage but less overall than combustion engines). Yet, there are no real gains.

There are many classes of crypto adventurers: libertarian idealists who dream of freedom from sovereign monetary control; hardware and software players “mining” the stuff for reward; traders who derive revenue from crypto transactions; speculators who ride the wild volatility of crypto; crypto “wallet” raiders; and criminals who exploit the relative degree of anonymity crypto offers as ransomware. Despite grand statements about reducing transaction costs and liberation from “fiat” money, none of the legitimate players have made a case for crypto contributions to general welfare. Beyond rhetoric they have not even seriously attempted to. Instead, they have relied on the naivete of lawmakers, regulators and journalists.

Well-informed commentators have described crypto as a “giant bubble.” Yet, regulators continue to display timidity in addressing the subject. While the Biden administration urges the auto industry to transition to 50 percent EVs by 2030, we recklessly allow crypto to escalate at huge current and potential cost to our carbon footprint.

China has at least taken one step in the direction of connecting crypto to climate change concerns: It has banned crypto mining. This activity will only move elsewhere. Legislators and policymakers should inform themselves now and act soon to stop the counterproductive growth of this industry, no matter how potent their lobbying forces have become. If they do not, even as the threat posed by global warming enters “code red” according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change we will find ourselves in yet another situation where an entrenched industry prevents us from advancing the common good and tackling climate change.

Coinbase customers have a lot to say about the nation’s largest cryptocurrency exchange platform. Interviews and thousands of complaints have revealed a pattern of account hacks where users have reported money vanishing from their accounts, reports CNBC. Then, when customers try to contact Coinbase support, they’re met with less than stellar customer service.

Coinbase has a market cap of about $65 billion, more than 68 million users in over 100 countries, over 2,100 full-time employees and $223 billion in held assets, according to the company.

Once criminals gain access to an account, funds can be drained within minutes. According to the FBI, transactions cannot be reversed, CNBC reports.

Retired U.S. Secret Service Agent Gus Dimitrelos told ABC Action News that cryptocurrency theft is one of the fastest-growing cyber-crimes. “There is no FDIC for the crypto world. You’re on your own. It’s still the wild, wild west,” Dimitrelos said. “This year, I’ve done more cryptocurrency fraud investigations than all other years combined. It’s because that’s where the money is today.”

Although the crypto exchange platform went public in April, complaints have been coming in since 2016. More than 11,000 complaints have been filed against Coinbase with the Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, mostly related to customer service. Former employees also told CNBC that the company’s customer service practices changed over time and representatives are struggling to keep up with demand.

CNBC noted that SIM swapping, where criminals take control of a victim’s phone number and SIM card through their phone company, is largely to blame for many of the cryptocurrency thefts. According to Etay Maor, senior director of security strategy for cybersecurity company Cato Networks, once hackers break into Coinbase accounts, they can put them up for sale on the dark web. Coinbase accounts can sell for $100 to $150, CNBC reported.

After reviewing 1,128 complaints over the past three years, the Better Business Bureau determined that the company has a “pattern of complaints from customers who state they are locked out of their accounts, even after providing required information or updates.”

2021-08-26,Cointelegraph,Ethereum supply shock: Exchange ETH reserves continue to fall after a 26% drop in 2021,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-supply-shock-exchange-eth-reserves-continue-to-fall-after-a-26-drop-in-2021,"The amount of Ether (ETH) held by all cryptocurrency exchanges has declined dramatically in the previous 12 months.

Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant reported that Ethereum reserves on trading platforms dropped 26.29 million ETH to 19.22 million ETH year-on-year (YoY), indicating that traders' preference to hold their tokens increased.

At least the Ether price performance in the same period indicates the same. Between August 25, 2020, and press time, the ETH/USD exchange rate exploded by a little over 730%— from $407 to $3,190, signaling an erratic inverse correlation between the Ethereum token prices and its reserves across all exchanges.

In detail, traders typically prefer to keep their crypto assets on exchange wallets when they wish to trade them in the near term. Otherwise, they move those assets to private wallets to control their own keys, a strategy that stems from the fears of losing funds to hacks and similar security breaches at crypto exchanges.

Ether deposits plunge

Another on-chain indicator, built by CoinMetrics to track the total number of Ether deposits to exchanges, also alerted holding sentiment among Ethereum traders. It noted that traders' ETH deposits across all the trading platforms had plunged 21.11% YoY, from 413,772 ETH to 326,408.

But in the last 30 days, the ETH deposits have dropped dramatically by 47.81%, signaling that many investors are expecting higher prices in the long term.

Meanwhile, the sum count of unique addresses holding any amount of Ether in the last 30 days has jumped 1.67%, coinciding with a 42% ETH/USD rally in the same period. On a YoY timeframe, the unique address count has jumped 30.87%.

Supply Squeeze

The Ether holding sentiment has picked momentum in days leading up to and after a landmark Ethereum network upgrade on August 5, 2021. Dubbed as the London Hard Fork, the software update implemented a proposal called EIP-1559 that enabled gas fee burning on the Ethereum network.

This has added deflationary pressure as a result. In the first 20 days after EIP-1559 went live, the network has burned almost 92,595 ETH worth around $295.85 million, according to WatchTheBurn.com.

More Ether went out of active supply as Ethereum invited participants to deposit 32 ETH to become validator on its upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain. Beacon Chain reports that the so-called Ethereum 2.0 smart contract has attracted a little over 6.9 million ETH worth around $22 billion.

Additionally, demand for Ether continues to grow owing to Ethereum's expanding ecosystem, containing projects from the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible token sectors.

Last week, Lyn Alden, the founder Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, called the London upgrade a ""tactically bullish"" event, noting that it could easily push ETH/USD rates to over $5,000.

2021-08-26,CNBC,"TikTok changed its policies, now cryptocurrency influencers consider moving to rival platforms",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/tiktok-policy-change-hurt-cryptocurrency-creators.html,"In this article BTC.CB=

ETC.BF=

A man holding a phone walks past a sign of Chinese company ByteDance's app TikTok, known locally as Douyin, at the International Artificial Products Expo in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China October 18, 2019. Reuters

If Lucas Dimos gets one more video removed from TikTok, he suspects he'll get kicked off the platform forever. In the last month, at least 10 of his videos have been taken down for promoting illegal activities and regulated goods. But Dimos, who posts content on a TikTok account called theblockchainboy, says he hasn't done anything wrong. ""It's left my account on such a razor's edge,"" said Dimos. ""We're dying out here. We're floundering. We've tried to build a community and guide this whole movement in the right direction."" TikTok cryptocurrency content creators like Dimos, who claim they are just trying to educate consumers about the emerging market, say they have been hard hit by rapid changes at the social media company. In July, TikTok implemented a system that can automatically block videos violating its policies, and the company recently updated its branded content policy, barring the promotion of financial services including cryptocurrencies, unless users disclose it through a branded content option in the app. CNBC spoke with 11 cryptocurrency creators for this story who say they have posted educational crypto videos, yet their content is getting flagged or taken down permanently with little explanation from TikTok. Some said their accounts are also getting temporarily banned more frequently. Most of the influencers CNBC spoke with said they haven't been paid to promote any crypto content on TikTok in the last few weeks, and that video views and new followers have dwindled since July.

TikTok declined to comment on the reports from creators. Instead, a spokesperson pointed CNBC to the company's community guidelines page. The spokesperson would not specify which guidelines crypto creators were violating. When videos are pulled from TikTok, the creators say they get a notification that they violated community guidelines. Sometimes it notes that they posted content related to 'illegal activities and regulated goods.' The guidelines haven't been updated since December, though TikTok rolled out its new detection feature a little over a month ago, when creators say the takedowns ramped up. Some of the creators CNBC spoke with are considering shifting to platforms like Google-owned YouTube, Twitter, Facebook's Instagram and the chatting app Discord, where they say they have more freedom to share content. ""The real issue isn't the advertisements,"" said a cryptocurrency influencer who goes by Wendy O. ""It's the fact that TikTok is shadow banning and censoring crypto content creators and a lot of us are posting great educational pieces.""

Navigating unknown terrain

The creators CNBC spoke with say the recent updates are warranted to crackdown on spam accounts or fraudulent money-making schemes like ""rug pulls,"" where individuals entice users to buy into a crypto, prop up the price and pull out. But they say the system is overcompensating and affecting those who are just trying to educate their audiences about crypto. ""It was almost like a knee-jerk reaction from TikTok against all of these scams that were going on,"" said Dimos, who has over 314,000 followers on the platform. ""While they may have blocked the scam posts, all of us creators are unable to post any of our content."" In recent weeks, creators say they can't use words like ""Binance,"" ""decentralized finance,"" or specific coins like bitcoin or ethereum in a video without it getting removed. The consensus among creators is that those words alert the algorithm, leading to an automatic takedown or review. Chart analysis and forecasting also flag the system, according to creators like Timothy, who goes by cryptoweatherman on TikTok. Under its community guidelines, TikTok says it will remove content ""including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, and text"" in violation, and that it uses a ""mix of technology and human moderation"" to enforce its guidelines before content is even reported. If a video is removed, the user is typically notified that the post violates a community guideline or relates to ""illegal activities and regulated goods."" But the message doesn't offer specifics, the creators said. The creators CNBC spoke with said if they get two videos taken down, they are banned from posting content for at least 24 hours. Bans can last anywhere from a day to a week, the creators who CNBC spoke with said. TikTok's guidelines say that users are notified when content is removed and that they can appeal the takedown if they ""believe no violation has occurred."" The company also says it will suspend or ban accounts that are repeatedly ""involved in severe or repeated violations"" and that they take into account ""information available on other platforms and offline in these decisions."" When the creators reach out to TikTok about an account ban or pulled video, most say they have been ignored or sent an automated response. There's no phone number to call, no representative to email, yet, some creators say when they appeal the takedown TikTok reinstates many videos. Joshua Thillens, who goes by Joshua Jake on TikTok, says he's had at least eight videos taken down. When CNBC spoke with Mason Versluis, a creator with nearly 430,000 followers on an account called cryptomasun, he was experiencing a 48-hour ban, which prevented him from posting. Prior to the guideline change, Versluis had one video taken down showing a car crash. In the last few weeks, he said between 30 and 35 of his videos have been taken down. Most were reinstated after he submitted an appeal. ""I'm not claiming to be a financial wizard or a financial advisor or even a trader,"" Versluis said. ""I'm simply someone who's been in crypto for four years. I've studied this in-depth and the information I bring and the opinions should speak for themselves.""

Views and followers reach a bottleneck

Many creators also say views and followers have slowed in recent weeks and followers say the creators aren't showing up on their ""For You"" pages. TikTok's community guidelines say the company may limit a post's visibility in search results and other feeds. Mack Lorden, who has over 102,000 followers on TikTok, says he quickly built his following when he launched his platform in January. But he ""reached a bottleneck"" last month, a change he attributes to both the guideline change and the price drop in the crypto market. Smaller creators like Miguel Morales, who has a little over 5,200 followers on his account called blockchaincrusader, are also feeling the pinch. Morales says views have dropped on good videos from almost 100,000 to 10,000. On a good day, he's lucky to get over 1,000 views. Nick Dye, who has over 14,400 followers on his account called the_cryptokeeper, says he was getting 300 to 400 followers a day consistently within the first few months of launching his account and after posting a viral video. He said new followers went from hundreds to maybe three or six per day after the policy change. His first 12,000 followers he says he got in just 25 days. The last couple thousand has taken double the time. ""No one knows what they can and can't say,"" Dye said. ""It discourages the newer creators like myself that have the knowledge and experience that they can offer. We're scared to share things for fear of getting banned.""

Getting creative with crypto content

In the weeks since the changes, creators say they are getting creative with the content they post. Wendy O. recently posted a series of videos referring to cryptocurrencies as ketos. Dye calls ethereum his ""girlfriend."" Carla Nasui and Walker Van Dixhorn, who are known as The Crypto Couple, have always used comedy to discuss crypto, a setup they say has kept them from getting banned. Morales has cut back from making three videos a day to just two. Some creators CNBC spoke with have done sponsored content in the past and say they can make anywhere from $300 to $20,000, depending on their following. That payment is occasionally made in cryptocurrencies. Versluis has partnered with DAO Maker, a crowdfunding platform that also serves as a launchpad for some cryptos, and IOI, one of the cryptocurrencies launched through it. Wendy O. created content for a platform involved in crypto-lending called Celsius. Some also make money through paid Discord subscriptions and one-on-one investing sessions. But all of the creators CNBC interviewed said they make most of their content for fun or to educate the masses and they never explicitly tell users to buy into a coin.

After a week of pushing all-time highs, Charles Hoskinson’s brainchild has announced the listing of ADA following months of box-ticking for Tokyo’s strict crypto licensing regime.

The cryptocurrency will launch for Japanese customers on the country’s most popular exchange BitPoint.

By meeting Japan’s tight rules the project, Cardano has unlocked a special status – appearing for the time to being regulator-proof.

Japan’s tight crypto rules

Japan’s cryptocurrency and digital asset licencing regime comes as part of wider stringent financial controls aimed at protecting Japanese investors from financial volatility, scams, and mis-selling.

Tokyo’s regulatory agency – the FSA – has established a dedicated crypto section, as well as a panel of financial experts to help the government oversee digital and decentralised finance.

The agency is also responsible for keeping track of developments in cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives, and preparing a regulatory response.

However, some Japanese lawmakers believe current licencing isn’t strict enough with calls this week driving the Tokyo financial regulator to consider tightening the regulations urgently, amid a global regulatory atmosphere of anxiety about the crypto industry.

So far, the only other cryptocurrencies to make the cut are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and LiteCoin (LTC).

This move comes at an exciting time for the Cardano project, with the public mainnet launch of Alonzo Purple on the horizon posited for September 12.

The network upgrade will deliver smart contract capabilities to ADA, and marks substantial progress for Hoskinson‘s famously long project roadmap – explaining the investor excitement driving the recent bullish Cardano price action.

Users were reportedly lured to install the apps on their phones in hope of turning rich in a snap by using cloud mining services that the apps claimed to be offering. But in reality, it was nothing more than a scam, as not even a single app had any crypto mining operations.

However, once a user installed the malicious app, he or she were charged anywhere between $14.99 to $18.99 as an additional fee that was falsely said to be boosting the income of users. Some of the apps, with absolutely no mining features, falsely claimed that the additional fee will improve their mining abilities.

So what

Earlier this month, new Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler sparked a minor freakout among cryptocurrency investors when he linked cryptocurrency trading with ""fraud"" in an interview with Bloomberg, and urged Congress to establish a ""robust oversight regime"" for the cryptocurrency market. Today, the woman Gensler replaced as head of the SEC -- now-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen -- was quoted by The Washington Post echoing Gensler's concerns.

Cryptocurrency ""is often [used] for illicit finance,"" said Yellen, adding that ""it's an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions,"" a ""highly speculative asset"" -- oh, and ""the amount of energy that's consumed in processing those transactions is staggering,"" to boot!

To put the icing on the cake, Yellen has also apparently advocated creating a ""central bank digital currency"" to compete with Bitcoin and other independently developed cryptocurrencies -- an idea China has also floated.

Now what

Add it all up, and the Post observes that a lot of cryptocurrency fans now fear that ""Yellen wants to annihilate the industry"" -- perhaps to make way for a national digital currency of the government's own making. Personally, I think that sounds a bit ambitious, and I'm not convinced the government could pull it off even if it wanted to. Still, when combined with previous comments from elsewhere in government -- specifically, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank president Neel Kashkari's accusation that non-governmental cryptocurrencies are ""95% fraud, hype, noise and confusion"" -- there's mounting evidence that momentum is building for some serious regulatory efforts to rein in cryptocurrency trading in the U.S.

Until we get a better idea of what, specifically, the government plans to do, I'd buckle up for more volatility in the crypto market in the weeks ahead.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640657/bitcoin-symbol-pinned-to-a-dartboard.jpg',)",none

We zoom in on some of the key features of crypto exchanges.A cryptocurrency exchange is an online platform where people exchange their fiat money (government-issued currency) into cryptocurrencies and vice versa.Depending on the customer's ease, competitive pricing and government regulation, cryptocurrency exchanges can be of three types :Centralised exchanges are the most highly accepted and used form in the world.Recently, demands of institutional investors for a centrally cleared and secure environment for trading led Eurex, an international exchange, to launch its first regulated Bitcoin derivatives market in Europe.Centralised exchanges are fully regulated and controlled by a central authority, as the name suggests. A centralised exchange is just like the stock exchange. They are governed by a company that offers crypto trading for fiat to crypto or crypto to crypto.* In CEX, the exchange acts as an intermediary or investor’s custodian, which holds the investors' money like a bank.* The trading in CEXs is done on the exchange’s database, like Coinbase or Binance ’s database, so they are more susceptible to cyber attacks.* CEXs don't give private keys to access wallets and require KYC regulations and verification.* They have high liquidity and enable faster transactions.* Some CEXs that offer fiat/crypto pairings are Coinbase, Bitterex and Kraken.* Some CEXs that offer crypto/crypto pairings are Binance, Huobi and KuCoin.or DEXs, on the other hand, are a peer-to-peer marketplace that directly connects buyers and sellers or the investors for carrying out transactions without any intermediary.DEXs work on the core principle that cryptocurrencies were designed for: no controls and regulations from the authorities.Here, the trading is done on blockchain which offers some advantages:* They can't be hacked or shut down by the government easily.* Provide investors security, transparency and greater control over trading and allow privacy to the users.* They have an automated process that controls all the transactions and doesn’t depend on a company to control the assets of an investor.Due to their limited functionality and absence of government controls, they are less popular and thus have lower trading volumes, lower liquidity and slower transactions.* Due to the absence of regulation, the funds sent to a wrong wallet cannot be cancelled or retrieved.They only offer crypto-to-crypto trading.* IDEX is the most-user friendly decentralised exchange for trading Ethereum tokens and Waves DEX is another one for trading Bitcoin and Litecoin.3) The third category is the Hybrid Exchange . This is said to be the next generation crypto trading marketplace as it bridges the limitation of both forms of exchanges by merging the privacy and security of DEXs and high liquidity, fast transaction and regulated framework of CEXs.Some of the benefits of hybrid exchanges are :* They incorporate solutions on blockchain technology.* Investors’ funds are stored in cold wallets, making them less prone to cyber thefts.* They provide real time access and ensure compliance to digital laws.* They allow users custody of their funds even if a third party is involved in the trading.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85625306,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-238610,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,India Today,Afghans hold on to cryptocurrency as Taliban takeover triggers economic crisis,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/afghans-hold-on-to-cryptocurrency-as-taliban-takeover-triggers-economic-crisis-1845266-2021-08-25,"Taliban's takeover over Afghanistan has already led to a sharp depreciation in the country's currency. (Photo: AP)

Some Afghans are relying on their cryptocurrency holdings amid the economic crisis triggered by the Taliban’s hostile takeover. Crypto assets won’t help citizens purchase anything immediately, but are a guarantee that their wealth will be safe amid economic instability.

Investing in cryptocurrencies is a fairly new concept in Afghanistan, but the country has seen rapid adoption of digital coins in 2021. The country ranked 20th out of 154 countries in the Chainalysis 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index — a huge improvement from 2020 when it did not even make the list. And upon isolating the country's peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, Afghanistan jumps up to 7th place, as per the report.

The data suggests that more Afghans started investing in cryptocurrencies this year, probably fearing an economic crisis as the Taliban began its quest to take control of the country.

Explained: The good, bad and ugly of investing in cryptocurrencies

In fact, Google Trends data revealed web searches in Afghanistan for ‘bitcoin’ and ‘crypto’ spiked in July, just weeks before the Taliban coup in Kabul. However, there is no way to determine the exact number of searches as the tool only calculates the measure of interest and does not record actual figures.

While digital coin adoption has increased in the country, there is no way to determine how many people of the total population have actually invested in cryptocurrencies.

AFGHANS WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY HOLDINGS

A 22-year-old Afghan with crypto holdings spoke to CNBC.com and said he has been keeping a close watch on his portfolio on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Farhan Hotak is among the few Afghans who will be protected from the currency onslaught triggered as a result of the Taliban’s takeover. Others like Hotak, who have invested in cryptos, will also be safe from the rapid currency depreciation. It may be noted that Afghanistan’s currency afghani plummeted sharply after the Taliban took control of the country.

Hotak said the scope of investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is very limited in Afghanistan. “I have very, very, very limited resources to do anything. I’m interested in the crypto world, because I have earned a lot, and I see a lot of potential in myself that I can go further,” he told CNBC.com.

Musa Ramin, 27, is another Afghan national who had invested a portion of his net worth into cryptocurrencies days before the Taliban entered Kabul.

Ramin first invested in cryptocurrencies after he lost money due to rapidly depreciating currency. In 2020, he got stuck in Turkey for six months due to the Covid-19 lockdown. He converted all his money to the lira, the Turkish currency. He encountered deep losses after the currency spiralled due to the Covid-induced global economic downturn. “That is when I discovered bitcoin,” he said.

At first, he lost a lot of money but has got a hang of managing digital assets, thanks to Twitter and YouTube tutorials. He still has significant crypto holdings and believes that it is the safest place to park his cash during economic volatility.

While cryptocurrency adoption has witnessed growth in Afghanistan, it is far from levels witnessed in other countries where digital assets have gained popularity. Electricity issues, bad internet, low banking and lack of awareness are some of the basic problems that have hindered large-scale crypto adoption in Afghanistan.

Technology developments and cyberattacks are an inevitable duo, and the latest battle is between cryptocurrency and hackers. As everyone is getting on the cryptocurrency wave, some malicious apps have to come to light that is misleading users.

Google has identified eight such apps on the Play Store and indefinitely banned them. These apps are intended to lure innocent users into installing them on their phones. These apps use the “get rich quick” scheme to attract users into investing money in a “cloud mining service” and repeating profits.

None of those apps are associated with cloud mining operations or have any cryptocurrency mining features. Instead, they charge in-app purchases from users as high as US$14.99 to US$18.99. Despite having no mining features, these apps falsely convince users that they can maximize the mining abilities with an additional fee.

The eight apps banned by Google are:

BitFunds – Crypto Cloud Mining

Bitcoin Miner – Cloud Mining

Bitcoin (BTC) – Pool Mining Cloud Wallet

Crypto Holic – Bitcoin Cloud Mining

Daily Bitcoin Rewards – Cloud Based Mining System

Bitcoin 2021

MineBit Pro – Crypto Cloud Mining & BTC miner

Ethereum (ETH) – Pool Mining Cloud

While there are already speculations about the long-term survival of cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment and currency option, such apps advocate for the case of increased fraudulent activities. Those who are apprehensive about cryptocurrencies have another reason to stay against them. The prolonged existence of such apps will damage the reputation of the cryptocurrency market.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-Cryptocurrency-Apps-Have-Been-Banned-by-Google-for-Fraud.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,Forbes,"Bitcoin And Ethereum Losses Headline $125 Billion Cryptocurrency Market Tumble, While NFT Sector Breaks New Records",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/08/25/bitcoin-and-ethereum-losses-headline-125-billion-cryptocurrency-market-tumble-while-nft-sector-breaks-new-records/,"Cryptocurrency prices according to COIN360 COIN360

The global cryptocurrency market endured a $125 billion pullback over the past 24 hours, losing 6.21% of its market capitalization as of the early morning.

The decline is led by bitcoin, which has shed 4.63% and is trading near $47,330 at 5:33 a.m. ET. The top cryptocurrency had briefly climbed above $50,000 for the first time since May following a stream of positive news, including cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announcing a $500 million crypto purchase program and United Wholesale Mortgage, second largest mortgage lender in the U.S., starting to accept bitcoin for payment.

Despite the surge, some analysts stayed cautious. “Medium-term U.S. and China regulatory headwinds remain,” noted Jehan Chu, founder and managing partner of Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, in a message to Forbes. “The world's largest exchange Binance remains under heavy enforcement pressure, and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's ominous comments on regulating DeFi could cut the legs out of any sustained rally. Expect the near-term pump to find sub-$30,000 BTC prices if broader U.S. economic sentiment suddenly turns south,” Chu warned.

Adding to the pressure is the inflow of coins to cryptocurrency exchanges, which means investors could be preparing to sell. 22,803 BTC, or over $1 billion, moved onto exchanges since Friday, according to William Clemente, lead insights analyst of Blockware Solutions.

Second largest cryptocurrency, ether, is also in retraction mode, having declined 6.7% over the past 24 hours to $3,123. Altcoins are following the trend, with XRP, Polkadot and Solana bearing the largest losses among the top 10 in the 9-11% range.

In contrast to cryptocurrencies, the market for non-fungible tokens is hitting new peaks. With the news of payments giant Visa buying its first NFT for $150,000, NFTs have caught on a new wave. Trading volume of NFT collection CryptoPunks, one of which Visa has famously bought, is up by 430% this week, according to DappRadar. One of these algorithmically generated characters sold for $5.33 million overnight. Leading collectibles marketplace OpenSea has set multiple daily records this month, reaching a new high of $209 million in trading volume yesterday, according to data from Dune Analytics.

Additionally, Budweiser appears to be the latest brand jumping on the NFT bandwagon. The company has changed its Twitter profile picture to that of a rocket ship designed by NFT artist Tom Sachs. The company may have also bought a beer.eth domain name, CoinDesk reports.","('https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F61261f9911c4e46dd9554556%2F0x0.jpg',)",none

(Photo: Reuters)

Cryptocurrency adoption has rapidly gained momentum in India despite uncertainty around the future of the unregulated digital asset. Investments in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, has registered a breathtaking rise in India since 2020.

Data from several domestic cryptocurrency exchanges suggest that millions of retail investors have signed up on their portals to invest in cryptocurrencies — an asset class known for notorious volatility and potential to deliver high returns.

At least 1.5 crore Indians have invested in cryptocurrencies, signalling strong cryptocurrency growth in a nation where households are known to invest more frequently in gold and other safer assets. The growing number of crypto adopters also suggests a shift in the investment paradigm, driven mostly by the country's younger population.

Explained: The good, bad and ugly of investing in cryptocurrencies

WHY MORE INDIANS ARE SHIFTING TO CRYPTOCURRENCIES?

More Indians started investing in cryptocurrencies from 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic led to a global economic crisis, resulting in higher volatility and depreciation in traditional assets like currencies, bonds and equities. As a result, more people around the globe started investing in cryptocurrencies.

This resulted in a sharp rise in crypto valuations throughout 2020, led by popular virtual coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

In India, cryptocurrency investments grew from approximately $923 million in April 2020 to a whopping $6.6 billion in May 2021. India ranks 11th out of 154 nations in terms of cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report prepared by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

While investments in gold are considered as an ideal hedge in times of economic downturn, more young Indians seem to have changed their appetite. As the situation stands, digital coin investments form a faction of bullion market holdings but younger Indians — between the age group of 18 and 35 years — find cryptocurrency a better option compared to gold.

The latest World Gold Council data also show that Indian adults, aged 34 or less, have a lower appetite for gold. A number of cryptocurrency experts said the tech-savvy younger population find it easier to invest in cryptocurrency than gold due to the processes involved.

WILL MORE INDIANS JOIN THE CRYPTO RACE?

Many Indians want to invest in cryptocurrencies but are worried about the asset’s uncertain future in the country. But data from domestic cryptocurrency exchanges indicate healthy growth in the number of investors.

Popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the country including WazirX, ZebPay, Unocoin and CoinDCX have seen massive growth in retail investors on their platform since 2020. They have recently seen a sharp rise in investors, days before Bitcoin’s value crossed $50,000 after a period of three months.

It may be noted that cryptocurrencies hit a rough patch earlier this year when China started a regulatory crackdown on virtual coins. The negative momentum dented the crypto market for months, following which virtual coins have recovered again.

Experts tracking the sector and founders of cryptocurrency exchanges believe that rapid fintech advancements and greater adoption will lead to a rise in the number of Indians investing in cryptocurrencies in the near future.

In fact, some of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges have invested in India due to growing virtual coin trade volumes and the rising number of retail participants. While there is uncertainty over the cryptocurrency ecosystem in India, global coin exchanges have found it hard to ignore the potential for growth in a country of 1.3 billion people.

Domestic exchanges are confident that more investors will join the cryptocurrency race in India after Bitcoin’s recent advance. After Bitcoin crossed $50,000 on Monday, cryptocurrency exchanges have seen a jump in their trading volumes and the value of investments.

The recent surge in the cryptocurrency market has not only led to a jump in new investors but also rekindled interest among old traders. Many analysts feel that the recent jump in virtual coin prices is linked to the rise in global cryptocurrency adoption.

LOOKING BEYOND BITCOIN

Experts tracking the cryptocurrencies have observed another positive trend: There is less panic among investors during sudden market dips and high volatility.

Many cryptocurrency exchange owners feel that investors have developed a greater understanding of the virtual coin market, leading to sustained trading rather than just plain buying.

Investors have realised that investing in smaller cryptocurrencies could reap as much profit as Bitcoin or Ether. As Indian investors dive deeper into the world of cryptocurrencies, they have started looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ether, which are expensive compared to altcoins — a term given other popular cryptocurrencies in the virtual coin ecosystem.

FACTBOX — CRYPTOCURRENCY ADOPTION IN INDIA At least 1.5 crore Indians hold cryptocurrencies assets Cryptocurrency investments have grown rapidly in India to $6.6 billion as of May 2021 Indians aged between 18-35 years are primarily driving cryptocurrency investments in the country India ranks 11th out of 154 nations in terms of cryptocurrency adoption Cryptocurrency exchanges feel more Indians want to invest in digital coins but are worried about the future Global cryptocurrency exchanges have invested heavily in India despite uncertainties

Instead of buying expensive cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ether, investors are also putting their money on lower-priced virtual coins such as XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Polkadot, Chainlink, Solana, UniSwap and more.

As mentioned earlier, calculated investments in altcoins could lead to massive gains as well. For instance, Cardano witnessed a sharp surge in valuation over the past few weeks. Therefore, any investment in Cardano over the past week could have led to healthy gains.

There is a notion, however, that Bitcoin’s value is still a driving factor behind the movements of altcoins. While this is true to some extent, there are days when altcoins outperform market leaders like Bitcoin and Ether. This is similar to when stock market madcaps and small caps outperform benchmarks like Sensex and Nifty.

ALL EYES ON THE GOVERNMENT'S CRYPTO BILL

Cryptocurrency trade has witnessed a boom in India over the past couple of years and there is scope for better growth, but there is one major hurdle. Regulatory uncertainty remains at large as the government is yet to come out with its cryptocurrency bill.

All eyes remain on the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which will determine the future of virtual coin trade in the country. The bill is currently awaiting approval from the Union Cabinet, following which it will be introduced in parliament.

While the government had earlier said it would enforce a ban on private cryptocurrencies, there has been a change in its stance, with officials hinting that trading activities could be regulated — a scenario favoured by all major cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country.

Many cryptocurrency exchanges believe that the early adoption of digital coin trade will help India gain an advantage in the rapidly growing global cryptocurrency ecosystem. They also believe that more people will start investing in cryptocurrencies once the government provides some clarity on the subject.","('https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202108/Cryptocurrency_demand_decoded-647x363.png?2E1Rmheloc6oUMCOpIL.mxJiA8dKXWPx',)",none
2021-08-26,News.com.au,Cardano tipped to replace Ethereum as second-largest cryptocurrency,https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/wealth/cardano-tipped-to-overtake-ethereum-as-secondlargest-cryptocurrency/news-story/a5734e7883b9e1781e8b9988cb575d17,"A mostly unknown cryptocurrency is on the right track to take out the number two position and potentially even kick bitcoin out of its prime spot.

A cryptocurrency which seemingly came out of nowhere is on the right track to take out the number two position and potentially even kick bitcoin out of its prime spot.

Confidence is building around cardano, a blockchain invented in 2015, after it overtook binance to come third on the crypto ladder, behind bitcoin and ethereum.

Experts think the coin has set its sights on surpassing ethereum next.

Last week, cardano (known as ADA in the crypto market) surged to a market capitalisation of $111.23 billion, officially overtaking binance which stood at $99.38 billion.

According to cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko, cardano has continued to skyrocket in the past week, rising by 35 per cent to $123.36 billion at time of writing.

Over the past 30 days, the coin has risen to nearly 187 per cent.

It’s believed cardano’s new-found popularity is from of the announcement of a major upgrade to the network called the Alonzo hard fork.

The coin’s more environmentally-friendly processing abilities, and its debut on the Japanese market, are also adding to the fervour.

Cardano is currently selling for $3.85.

Although that’s significantly less than its rival ethereum, which is sitting on $4429.23 per coin, experts have predicted that major gains are on the horizon.

Independent crypto analyst and YouTuber Lark Davis said that if cardano quadruples its value, which is possible given its current gains, it would hit the same market cap as ethereum.

And if it rose by 10 times, then it would have be neck and neck with the largest ever cryptocurrency, bitcoin.

An expert’s prediction on crypto.

What is Cardano?

Perhaps it’s not surprising that cardano is posing a very real threat to ethereum, considering that it was founded by someone who also created the ether token.

Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson created cardano in 2015 and launched it in 2017.

The coin is known as ADA on the crypto market, which is an homage to Augusta “Ada” King, or Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century British countess largely regarded as the first computer programmer.

She was also the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron.

Cardano has just hit the Japanese market.

What is the Alonzo hard fork update?

Last week, cardano announced the Alonzo hard fork which caused interest in the coin to hit an all-time high.

The upgrade allows for smart contracts to happen, which are pieces of computer code that can automatically execute when the right parameters are set.

That means once the Alonzo update is complete, anyone can make their own smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain, paving the way for native decentralised applications (dapps), according to CoinDesk.

Decentralised applications allows people to borrow, lend and trade with each other instantly, without any interference from a third party such as waiting on a bank to make the transaction.

The Alonzo hard fork is the third major update in cardano’s current stage.

The token has five main stages of development, also called “eras” which aim to expand the network and make it run as smoothly as possible.

They are named after famous writers from the Romantic movement of the 1800s: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, Voltaire.

Alonzo is the last major update for the Shelley era and moves the platform towards the Goguen era.

The Alonzo update is expected to begin sometime during the third quarter of this year.

Other reasons for the price spike

Another reason for cardano’s surge is that from Wednesday, the coin will be listed on Japan’s exchange.

Japan’s criteria to enter the market is considered one of the strictest in the world, which is another win for cardano.

Bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin are also on the Japanese market.

Cardano is also hugely popular because its proof of stake blockchain model is considered much more environmentally-friendly than any other mainstream cryptocurrency.

Proof of stake works means coins are randomly allocated to users, cutting down the energy needed for a transaction.

In contrast, bitcoin and ethereum use a proof of work mechanism which sees a global network of computers running simultaneously to facilitate a transaction.

Such a method requires an enormous amount of energy, with Bitcoinenergyconsumption.com estimating that bitcoin generated over 57 million tonnes of CO2 in a year – the same carbon footprint as a small European country.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a751d69b6c9ba78ad577b5b2334101e8',)",none
2021-08-26,NDTV Gadgets 360,"Bitcoin Adoption in El Salvador: Remittance Costs Key to Take-Up of Cryptocurrency, Development Bank Says",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-price-cryptocurrency-el-salvador-adoption-remittance-costs-development-bank-2518241,"Central American countries are eagerly waiting to see if El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as parallel legal tender cuts the cost of remittances, an important source of income for millions of people, the region's development bank said.

President Nayib Bukele's congressional allies have already approved legislation giving the cryptocurrency official currency status alongside the US dollar, a first in the world. The move takes effect in September.

Bukele has touted Bitcoin adoption as a way to facilitate remittance payments from Salvadorans living abroad. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 37.86 lakhs as of 1pm IST on August 25.

""Everyone is watching if it goes well for El Salvador and if, for example, the cost of remittances drops substantially ... other countries will probably seek that advantage and adopt it,"" Dante Mossi, the executive president of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), told Reuters.

Mossi called the plan an ""out of this world experiment"" geared at increasing financial inclusion in a region where many people lack access to bank accounts or credit cards, and rely on money sent home from relatives living in the United States.

CABEI, the regional development bank, is giving El Salvador technical assistance on implementing the cryptocurrency, an important show of support as the World Bank declined to help, citing environmental and transparency drawbacks.

Mossi said the Central American nations that receive the most remittances are those most likely to favour using Bitcoin and underscored that CABEI had a ""fiduciary obligation"" to support El Salvador in its request for help.

""Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador are the countries that would have the most to gain if the adoption of Bitcoin lowered the cost of sending remittances,"" said Mossi.

CABEI participated in a recent meeting of the Central American Monetary Council, part of the Central American Integration System (SICA), where participants asked about El Salvador's Bitcoin plans and showed interest, he added.

The Central Bank of Honduras referred Reuters to a June 11 statement which said the bank does not prohibit, supervise or guarantee the use of cryptocurrencies as methods of payment in the country.

The governments of Guatemala and Honduras did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Under 1 percent of the volume of global crossborder remittances are currently in crypto, according to Autonomous Research, but in the future crypto is expected to account for a larger slice of the more than $500 billion (roughly Rs. 37,13,950 crores) in for annual global remittances.

Bitcoin offers, in theory, a quick and cheap way to send money across borders without relying on traditional channels.

CABEI's head of investments Carlos Sanchez said the bank's technical assistance is focused on helping El Salvador design a legal framework for the adoption of Bitcoin and to make sure strict international money laundering protocols are adhered to.

The assistance is meant to help El Salvador ""navigate waters that have yet to be explored,"" said Sanchez.

2021-08-26,The Economic Times,Cardano returns 150% in a month to become the third-largest cryptocurrency,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/cardano-returns-150-in-a-month-to-become-the-third-largest-cryptocurrency/articleshow/85617141.cms,"ET Spotlight Special

ET Spotlight Special

A little-known digital token tied to the Cardano blockchain has just surpassed other top alt-coins to become the third-largest virtual currency worldwide, as network developers aim to capitalise on the surge in decentralised finance that has swept the world.Currently, the popular alt-coin traded on cryptocurrency exchanges like CoinSwitch Kuber , Cardano's native coin, ADA, defied a major price crash warning to rise to an all-time high, surpassing the previous record. For the very first time on Friday, the ADA/USD rate of exchange surpassed $2.56, marking the culmination of a 154.54% price increase that began on July 20. This was achieved despite renowned trader Peter Brandt's warning of a price fall, which was predicated on a typical bearish pattern known as the head and shoulders pattern.With the price of the ADA coin soaring by about 50% in only the past week, there is growing confidence that new technological advancements will enable payment systems on Cardano earlier than the previously declared date of September 12. This will allow its network to provide profitable services like DeFi, where Ethereum presently holds a dominant position.In anticipation of the planned “Alonzo” upgrade, which is scheduled to be released on September 12, ADA investors are continuing to drive the value of Cardano higher. The Alonzo upgrade will bring smart-contract* functionality to the blockchain, allowing Cardano to establish itself as a legitimate player in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space.ADA is among the most highly sought-after cryptocurrencies for new traders due to its still-relatively low price and excellent marketing as one of the potential ""Ethereum killers."" There is little reason to suspect that Cardano is a favourite of the crypto world, and ADA is among the most highly sought-after cryptocurrencies for new traders due to its still-relatively low price and a promising future.With Cardano's ability to handle smart contracts—self-executing agreements among buyers and sellers—the token has gained consistently while Ethereum, Cardano’s core competitor, continues to dominate the growing $100 billion decentralised finance sector.Recently, the Solana blockchain ecosystem began to take shape with DeFi and NFTs, but despite the fact that Cardano has no actual use cases as of yet, the cryptocurrency's market capitalization is about 4x the size of Sol's market capitalization of $20 billion. Cardano has practically risen from the ashes on the backs of speculators and the promise of a fantastic and extremely transparent development team.Smart contracts, also known as blockchain contracts, are distinguished by the method in which they assure conformity between the two parties involved in the transaction. The immutability of a self-executing contract is one of the most notable characteristics of this type of contract. It implies that once codes, regulations, and even transactions have been written into the blockchain, it is hard to reverse, alter, change, or tamper with them.Smart contracts, similar to the traditional ones, are contracts between two or more parties that do not require the participation of a third party to monitor or enforce the agreement.As part of its operation, the blockchain network preserves a transaction record that is visible, secure, and unchangeable, ensuring that evidence of ownership is established and transferred. Contract discussion and application are made considerably more accessible, and the whole edit record of the deal is made publicly visible to all parties involved.When people use decentralised finance, also known as DeFi, they are transferring financial functions directly onto digital ledgers, allowing them to perform things such as, lend or borrow cash and collect interest in a savings-like account, all without the need for traditional middlemen such as banks. Its growing prevalence is part of a broader trend of rising blockchain usage, which is becoming more widespread.A series of recent rises in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, ADA, and other tokens pushed the cryptocurrency market to surpass $2 trillion in value this weekend, a first since the mid-May crash.With a gain of 1,300% in only one year, ADA is among the top-five best-performing cryptocurrencies, outpacing gains of 1,030% for Binance Coin, 330% for Ether, and 59% for Bitcoin, among other cryptocurrencies. The token, on the other hand, is extremely vulnerable to the enormous volatility of the larger cryptocurrency market.As a result of RBI’s crypto crackdown in 2018, the value of ADA plummeted by roughly 90%, ushering in a years-long bear market for the young sector. However, with the emergence of popular crypto exchanges in India, investments in crypto assets jumped from $200 million in 2019 to $40 billion in 2020. As of today, CoinSwitch Kuber , India’s leading crypto exchange has over 9 million registered users invested in crypto.All eyes will now be on the September 12 “Alonzo” upgrade and how it will tie back to ADA’s current positive run. If things go well, ADA could be seen as a primary competitor to Ethereum, ushering yet another era in the cryptocurrency sector.The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.

2021-08-26,Analytics Insight,6 Strategies to Make Money With Cryptocurrency,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/6-strategies-to-make-money-with-cryptocurrency/,"6 Strategies to Make Money With Cryptocurrency

Let’s unveil smart methods to make profits in the cryptocurrency market.

So, you have heard stories about cryptocurrency millionaires and want to try your hand at it? Originally, cryptocurrency was intended to become a global model of payment but currently, people are investing in cryptocurrencies to make money. This is not as easy as it sounds. A lot of people end up losing money or giving up halfway due to a lack of understanding.

The cryptocurrency industry is still in its early stages and crypto-assets are subject to massive market volatility. When the prices increase, investors are attracted to the industry and with market crashes, they incur heavy losses. But there are certain strategies that experienced investors use to make money with cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency trading is the most popular method to make money but there is a lot of volatility which makes it highly risky. But owing to the market’s immense growth potential, there are other effective strategies to make profits with cryptocurrency.

1. Investing

Investing in cryptocurrencies for the long term is an ideal strategy. Several popular cryptocurrencies are well suited to a buy-and-hold strategy. Coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are volatile for short periods but profitable in the long term.

2. Trading

Trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market is tough but not impossible. To be a successful trader, you should have analytical and technical skills. You will have to analyze technical charts on the performance to make accurate predictions about the price increase and decrease. While trading you can either take a long position or a short position, according to your prediction of rising or fall. This way, you can make profits regardless of whether the market is bearish or bullish.

3. Staking and Lending

Staking is a way of owning cryptocurrency but not spending them. By validating cryptocurrency transactions, you receive rewards in the form of crypto coins. These coins will be locked in the crypto wallet. A Proof-of-stake blockchain network that is used by many cryptocurrencies is ideal for this method. The reward you receive to verify transactions is similar to the interest a bank would pay for a credit balance.

4. Social Media

Since 2011, several blockchain startups have been launched to leverage the new technology. These startups have social media platforms and many of those companies reward people for creating and curating content for them with the native crypto coin of that platform.

5. Mining

Cryptocurrency mining is a crucial component of the proof of work mechanism. If you mind a cryptocurrency, you are rewarded with the new coins. Mining requires technical expertise and computing investment. You need to have a coding background and massively powerful computers in cold environments.

6. Airdrops

Airdrops are free tokens are distributed to raise awareness. Usually done by crypto exchanges, airdrops are done to create a larger user base for a project. With tokens received through airdrops, you can buy more cryptocurrencies and trade with them.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Strategies-to-Make-Money-With-Cryptocurrency.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,India Today,"Cryptocurrency prices today: Bitcoin, Ether dip after heavy selloff",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/cryptocurrency-prices-on-august-25-check-bitcoin-ether-cardano-dogecoin-value-1845033-2021-08-25,"Cryptocurrencies have lost momentum as prices of popular virtual coins dipped sharply on Wednesday. The entire cryptocurrency market capitalisation has dropped by 4 per cent in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin, which had crossed $50,000 for the first time since May on Monday, retreated yesterday due to profit-booking by investors, according to a Reuters news report quoting Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.

Commenting on the weakness in the virtual coin market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “Bitcoin seems to be facing strong resistance at the current price. Since its drop below $50,000, the bears have been in a dominating position.”

“The nearest strong support is at $46,750. The selloff across most Altcoins was much higher. Over the past 24 hours, we witnessed the entire market cap drop by almost 4%, with traded volumes going up,” he added.

""It indicates the bearish momentum prevailing in the markets currently.”

The cryptocurrency was trading in the red after hitting a high of above $50,000, which was not seen since May of 2021. Bitcoin was trading at $48,210.85, which was witnessing a trend of 2.12 per cent down over the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap.com. Over the course of the last seven days, however, the coin had been trading at 7.88 per cent up with a market cap of $904.90 billion. Bitcoin had maintained a market dominance of 43.71 per cent with an increase of 0.36 per cent over the course of the day according to the crypto listing website.

Speaking on the recent developments of Bitcoin in the market, Edul Patel, the CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex said, “The past 24 hours were a major profit booking session. We witnessed a selloff across the entire crypto spectrum. Over the past couple of days, Bitcoin consolidated around the $50,000 mark. Bears found the perfect opportunity to bring the markets down after the bulls cooled off, and several investors booked profits. We witnessed a bigger dip across the Altcoins after days of intense rallying. The coming 24 hours could continue to be another bearish session.""

Other major altcoins like Ethereum were trading at $3,202.19 or 3.14 per cent lower at the time of this article. It was trading up at 6.13 per cent over the last week.

Speaking on the performance of Ether, Siddharth Menon, the COO WazirX said, “Ether continues to maintain its strength against Bitcoin leading the pact of Altcoins. Currently, 7 per cent of total ETH supply is staked for ETH 2.0, this shows the markets are really optimistic about Ether which is a strong indication of a bull run in Altcoins.”

He went on to add, “Projects like Cardano, Binance smartchain and Solana solving one of the critical problems of scaling through smart contracts shows tremendous strength against Bitcoin. One has to factor in the volatility of Altcoins before investing in them.”

The global crypto market cap stood at $2.07 trillion with a downward trend of 3.18 per cent over the last day. The total market volume over the last 24 hours was $117.63 billion which indicated an increase of 0.91 per cent.

“The overall crypto market looks strong as it trades above the 9-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average). The reversal was seen from 20th July 2021 and since then the crypto markets has been taking support on 9-day EMA and successfully trading above it. The chart seems to be forming the right side of the cup pattern, generally this pattern is seen in bull markets during consolidation phase. Once it breaks the previous ATH (All time high) of $2.57 trillion, the crypto markets will go in price discovery mode,” said Menon, while talking about the performance of the overall market.

2021-08-26,NDTV.com,The World Of Cryptocurrency Wallets And Exchanges: A Deep Dive,https://www.ndtv.com/business/cryptocurrency-wallets-and-exchanges-how-do-they-work-2516904,"A cryptocurrency exchange is a platform that helps a user to buy and sell tokens

If the discourse around and about cryptocurrency has encouraged you to venture into the market of digital tokens, it's important that you understand the various components of it. And before you take a deep dive into this ecosystem, make sure you know enough about what makes the world of digital tokens function, where they are stored, and how safe they are. And when we speak of storing cryptocurrency, two significant but different components come to mind. Cryptocurrency wallets and cryptocurrency exchange.

Cryptocurrency wallets

Just as you don't always carry your cash in hand and instead store it in your wallet, a cryptocurrency wallet is similar in many ways. It stores your digital tokens and keeps them safe just as your bank keeps your savings safe. Besides, a crypto wallet also facilitates sending and receiving digital currencies. Since cryptocurrencies are not tangible or in a physical form, these wallets store them and a user or owner of the wallet can make use of them as per his need.

There is another significant aspect of your crypto wallet and they are the keys. Your wallet has private and public keys that help you control as well as make your wallet function. The private keys help you sign a transaction, meaning they are similar to passwords when it comes to spending your digital tokens. And that's why you have to ensure they remain safe. If anyone gets access to your private keys, you might lose all your balance.

The public keys, on the other hand, act similar to your username on a payment app and help you receive crypto tokens from other users.

Cryptocurrency exchanges

As the name itself suggests, a cryptocurrency exchange is a platform that helps a user to buy and sell tokens. The exchange can be accessed on the internet as well as through an app. Not only does it facilitate buying and selling crypto tokens but also allows you to convert your money in fiat currency into digital tokens of your liking. The major difference between a wallet and an exchange is that the purpose of the former is primarily storage while the latter facilitates transactions as well as the conversion of currency into cash and vice-versa.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/jnqec5do_cryptocurrency_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,Mint,"Cryptocurrency prices today fall. Check latest rates of Bitcoin, ether, dogecoin, other cryptos",https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-prices-today-fall-check-latest-rates-of-bitcoin-ether-dogecoin-other-cryptos-11629858322093.html,"In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin prices today were trading below $49,000 mark. The world's largest crypto broke above $50,000 level on Monday for the first time since mid-May as crypto prices continued an ongoing recovery from a disorderly rout just three months ago. Bitcoin is up 65% this year, though, far away from its record just below $65,000 in April.

As per CoinDesk, Bitcoin prices fell to $48,230, down nearly 2%. Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, plunged to $3,211, down over 2.5%. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was trading with cuts of 6% at $0.29. Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also declined in the range of 3-7% over the past 24 hours.

A consortium including Coinbase Global Inc. said all the reserves of the second-largest cryptocurrency stable coin will shift into cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries, forgoing riskier investments, reported Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, US crypto exchange Coinbase last week received its board’s approval to buy over $500 million of crypto. Moreover, 10% of the firm’s quarterly net income from now on will go into crypto assets.

Bitcoin enjoyed a blistering run earlier this year but in mid-May it began tumbling on a range of issues, including China's crackdown on cryptocurrencies and Tesla boss Elon Musk's decision to stop accepting it on concerns about the environmental impact of mining.

Market sentiment benefited as PayPal Holdings Inc will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week. The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class.

As of the 23rd of August, on average, our 24-hour trading volumes have been around $100 million. However, last week our average trading volume crossed $300 million.”Bitcoin had hit an all-time high and touched $64,000 in April this year.This was followed by a sell-off at a global stage and the prices had dipped to $30,000 due to Chinese authorities clamping down on Bitcoin’s mining operations and regulators threatening to bring in domestic laws to regulate the currency.The prices have been steadily rising since mid-July as the confidence of many buyers seems to be returning to crypto assets.Industry trackers say this time around, not only have the old investors become more active, even new ones seem to be coming in.“As we see a surge in the global adoption of crypto assets, OKEx.com has witnessed new users’ sign-ups increase by almost 50% in the past month. In the past month, we have seen almost a 90% increase in trade volumes,” said Jay Hao, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx.com.BuyUcoin witnessed more than a 3x increase in sign-ups during August as compared to July and 4x when compared to June.There are close to 15 million crypto investors in India holding digital assets worth ₹15,000 crore.In India, investors seem to have made large investments into the crypto assets during the price dip, which has resulted in the latest bull-run across crypto assets, say industry trackers.“BuyUcoin has experienced a surge in trade volumes both on the buy and sell-side. Investors are buying in the bull-run and holders have liquidated profits,” said Thakral.In the last two years, several Indian investors seem to have warmed up to crypto-assets and some have even taken up trading.Although Bitcoin continues to remain the favourite, other crypto-assets including Ethereum, Dogecoin, Polkadot, Ripple, Litecoin, Filecoin, Cardano (ADA) and Cardano too have seen some traction on Indian exchanges.Industry trackers say Coinbase’s announcement to buy $500 million in crypto assets combined with PayPal’s foray into digital currencies could be the main factors for the global rally.India wants to regulate cryptocurrencies but there is no clarity around how that would be done.The government has come out with a proposed Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, but no regulations have been finalised.In mid-August, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the new laws around crypto assets are awaiting approval of the Union Cabinet.On Tuesday, Bitcoin was down 1%, while other major cryptocurrencies were trading 0.5% up or down.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85612606,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35584,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none

2021-08-26,Deseret News,What might happen to Shiba Inu coin this winter,https://www.deseret.com/2021/8/24/22639330/shib-coin-shiba-inu-coin-winter-2021-predictions,"Shiba Inu coin might be headed for a dark winter, especially if there isn’t any more social media hype that draws up massive support.

Shiba Inu coin predictions for the winter

Expert Liam Andrew Wright, a writer for crypto news site Benzinga, doesn’t see a great winter ahead for some cryptocurrencies, like Safemoon, Doge and Shiba Inu coin since they rely on social media hype and mentions from prominent figures, like Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

“I am not saying that Doge, Safemoon, or Shiba Inu are baseless projects without any strong fundamentals,” he wrote. “I am saying that these projects have risen due to social media hype and community momentum rather than their fundamentals. The fundamentals of the project are only discussed in hindsight on subreddits for the most part. Doge is the epitome of a hype play, and without Elon Musk, it would unlikely be in the place it is today.”

Wright said meme-based cryptocurrencies might suffer a sharp fall if there are more investments in the near future. People will invest in the crypto tokens but then sell off their earnings, creating another crash. This is similar to what happened after cryptocurrencies peaked in spring 2021, as many have now lost a significant chunk of value.

Is Shiba Inu coin going to rise again?

Without a doubt, the time to sell sweets or lemonades is behind us, today's children bring a shark's mind.

Two American brothers learned how to earn money through an ethereum (ETH) mine that they established in their home garage. Ishaan and Aanya Thakur , aged 14 and 9 respectively, have generated monthly earnings of $ 35,000 (approximately 707,390 Mexican pesos), according to The Dallas Morning News .

According to the local newspaper, the little ones who live in Frisco, Texas, began with the dream of having their own mining operation after their father told them a story about the growth of bitcoin before they went to sleep.

At first they thought of trying the highest value cryptocurrency on the market (bitcoin), however, they did not have the money to invest in it, they still decided to buy the necessary equipment for crypto mining.

In this way, in March of this year, the brothers began mining through an old gaming computer that allowed them to generate earnings of a thousand dollars (approximately 20,219 Mexican pesos) in their first month.

We want to continue growing

The youngsters had a desire to expand their crypto mining. However, they ran into a problem: the shortage of graphics cards used for such activity. But, they looked for a solution: They signed up to receive updates on supplies from various electronics stores and when they received them they quickly went for the necessary instruments.

Self-taught

The brothers reported that they learned to mine cryptocurrency in a self-taught way through YouTube videos, and their father helped them through a loan to buy the necessary equipment.

Now small entrepreneurs use their money on inputs to continue growing their farm, paying for electricity from renewable energy, and also seek to save for their university studies.","('https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1629837327-Ninos-ETH.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,The Motley Fool,Why Cryptocurrencies Are Down Big Today,https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/24/why-cryptocurrencies-are-down-big-today/,"What happened

In another volatile day, cryptocurrencies dropped rapidly on Tuesday, more than reversing Monday's gains. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) has fallen 3%, Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) is down 5%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) has dropped 7.6%. Momentum also appears to be pushing these cryptocurrencies lower, so the fall may not be over yet.

As usual, regular volatility is likely the biggest driver with cryptocurrencies simply selling off as investors take profits. But there are some fundamental concerns that investors are likely worried about as well.

So what

I think the biggest concern is hackers stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks. The $600 million hack of the Poly Network hit the sector a couple of weeks ago, but those funds have now been returned. It's a lower-profile $97 million heist last week that investors may just be hearing about. Theives have reportedly already ""cleaned"" $20 million in cryptocurrencies that may not be recovered and it's possible most of the stolen cryptocurrency is gone. If hacking risk grows, it could be terrible for cryptocurrencies long-term.

The regulatory front is full of risks as well. SEC chair Gary Gensler has said he is in favor of rules that protect investors and consumers without completely killing cryptocurrencies. And for now that means treating them as securities, just like any stock or bond. That comes with a double-edged sword: On one hand, it signals legitimacy that could increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies; on the other hand, it could mean broad tax consequences for traders and investors. And with rules still up in the air, it's not surprising to see a pullback when cryptocurrencies rise like they did yesterday.

On the trading angle, it's not unusual for an asset to pull back after a quick increase in price. In the case of each of these cryptocurrencies, you can see that they jumped over 50% in value over the last month, before today's pullback. Sometimes a correction is just a normal part of investing.

Now what

The battle between cryptocurrency fans and the traditional financial infrastructure continues, and it will be a volatile ride. But I think it's clear that cryptocurrencies are carving out a niche for themselves, whether that's as a store of value or a way to pay for goods and services. But there are still unknowns when it comes to how governments around the world will treat cryptocurrencies.

What's most concerning long-term is the regular hacks that hit cryptocurrency wallets. If investors and consumers can't trust that their cryptocurrency will be safe they may not adopt it as widely as many hope. And that's ultimately what will keep cryptocurrency values from growing.

I would chalk today up as another example of volatility in cryptocurrencies, but watch the hacking and regulatory trends for cryptocurrencies because that's what will likely tell us if this pullback is temporary or the start of a downward trend.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640537/bitcoin-bubble-bursting.jpg',)",none

More people are jumping into cryptocurrency, many because of how easy it's become to trade the digital assets, a CNBC/Momentive Invest in You survey found. More than 10% of those surveyed said they're invested in cryptocurrency, ranking the digital coins fourth after real estate, stocks, mutual funds and bonds. Some 65% of those cryptocurrency investors jumped into the asset class in the last year, according to the survey. In the same timeframe, the prices of some of the top cryptocurrencies have displayed trademark volatility. Bitcoin, for example, surged to an all-time high of more than $63,000 in April, slumped afterwards and then recently rallied again to nearly $50,000. Among those who do trade cryptocurrencies, the top reasons cited are that it's easy to make trades, it's exciting to invest in and there's potential for high growth in a short period of time, according to the survey.

""There are a lot of things that make crypto very attractive; the biggest one is the opportunity to make a lot of money,"" said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York. Education is key Of course, there is still risk associated with investing in cryptocurrency, as there is with any other asset. The space may be exciting and cool, said Boneparth, ""but it doesn't change the fact that you're still putting risk on your money."" For people who are interested in jumping in, experts recommend that they first do their research on cryptocurrency to make sure they really understand what they're buying. More from Invest in You:

Chesnot/Getty Images

Investment in cryptocurrency funds and products brought in $21 million last week, said CoinShares.

Solana drew in $7.1 million, the largest amount among all digital assets.

Solana's price has been on a tear, more than doubling in August.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Investment in crypto products and funds snapped six weeks of outflows by drawing $21 million last week, led by Solana, the token on the high-speed blockchain network that's seen its value double in August alone.

Solana was the standout cryptocurrency last week as inflows of $7.1 million outpaced that of other digital assets, said CoinShares, a digital asset management company in a weekly update published Monday.

Solana is widely regarded as a competitor to Ethereum, a blockchain platform on which so-called smart contracts are built. Solana's price jumped by 75% to $78.72 in a seven-day run ended August 20, and during Monday's session, it marked a 105% surge from the end of July.

The altcoin has been attracting attention following capital inflows into a number of projects based on Solana's blockchain. Solana is home to Serum, a decentralized exchange founded by crypto-billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.

Crypto funds are now carrying $57.3 billion in total assets under management, the highest amount since mid-May, a reflection of positive price action and an indication of improved investor sentiment, said CoinShares.

Ethereum, whose token is ether, logged ""minor"" inflows of $3.2 million last week, and Cardano brought in $6.4 million.

Bitcoin was the most traded cryptocurrency, and had outflows of $2.8 million, the seventh consecutive week of outflows that matched the longest run since January 2018. ""While this may suggest sentiment remains negative, it masks very mixed flows across providers,"" said CoinShares.

Bitcoin traded above $50,000 on Monday, surpassing that price on Sunday for the first time since May 15.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/6110f1d638aff7001890788f?format=jpeg',)",none
2021-08-26,CNBC,Coinbase slammed for what users say is terrible customer service after hackers drain their accounts,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/coinbase-slammed-for-terrible-customer-service-after-hackers-drain-user-accounts.html,"In this article COIN

For Tanja Vidovic, it was a moment of panic: She had received a series of alerts about someone changing access to her cryptocurrency account. And she realized, as she stared at her computer screen, that nearly all of her $168,000 in holdings was gone — vanished before her eyes. She was stunned. Nearly four months have passed, and it has yet to sink in, she said. Tanja and Jared Vidovic jumped into cryptocurrency investing in 2017 and watched their funds nearly quadruple over four years. The Vidovics used Coinbase, the country's largest cryptocurrency exchange, for their plunge into the virtual currency. On exchanges such as Coinbase, users can deposit U.S. dollars and trade them for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, which the couple purchased. ""I looked into Coinbase, and it seemed like it was one that everybody used and trusted,"" Tanja said. The growing investment was a welcome boon for the Safety Harbor, Florida, couple and their three children. But in late April, Tanja, a firefighter, opened her computer to a barrage of security alerts and password change notifications. ""I signed onto the crypto. And I said, 'It's gone,'"" Tanja said. The Vidovics said they tried to contact Coinbase but they couldn't get anybody on the phone. Interviews with Coinbase customers around the country and a review of thousands of complaints reveal a pattern of account takeovers, where users see money suddenly vanish from their account, followed by poor customer service from Coinbase that made those users feel left hanging and angry. Making the issue even worse, cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reversed, according to the FBI. Experts say once criminals access an account, funds can be drained in minutes. Coinbase, which went public in April, has a market cap of about $65 billion, has more than 68 million users in 100-plus countries, more than 2,100 full-time employees and $223 billion in held assets, according to the company.

""Hopefully, Coinbase going public and having its direct listing is going to be viewed as kind of a landmark moment for the crypto space,"" CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC in April, when the company went public. ""People no longer need to be scared of it like in the early days."" While the cryptocurrency exchange company has grown rapidly, complaints have continued to arise. Since 2016, Coinbase users have filed more than 11,000 complaints against Coinbase with the Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, mostly related to customer service. Former employees told CNBC the company's customer service practices shifted over time, with representatives struggling to keep up with demand.

Money vanished

The Vidovics' account had risen to $168,596 on April 28 when the hacking occurred, according to account statements the Vidovics shared with CNBC. That amount was essentially wiped out, with only a $587.15 balance shown the next day.

Like the Vidovics, Ben, a Virginia resident who asked that his last name be withheld, said he saw thousands of dollars vanish. He logged onto his Coinbase app in March, verifying his identity with two-factor authentication, but over a four-minute stretch almost $35,000 in various coins disappeared from his account, he said. In a response to his frantic email, Coinbase told Ben his computer had been hacked and there wasn't anything the company could do. ""I really am baffled,"" he said. ""It just seems to me that Coinbase did absolutely zero research and just said, 'Hey, yeah, sorry.'"" The CFPB responded to one of Ben's ensuing complaints with an answer from Coinbase's Regulatory Response Team. The email noted that transactions on the blockchain are irrevocable and said Coinbase's insurance policy does not cover theft from individual accounts. ""There is no credible or supportable evidence that the compromise of your login credentials was the fault of Coinbase,"" the message said. ""As a result, Coinbase is unable to reimburse you for your alleged losses."" Eventually, the company sent a $200 credit, telling Ben, ""your Coinbase experience and your wait for a response to your formal complaint was not up to our standards."" Experts say SIM swapping, where fraudsters seize control of a victim's phone number and SIM card through their phone company, is to blame for many of the cryptocurrency thefts. ""The problem with SIM swapping and cryptocurrency is the moment you lose access to your cell phone, professional hackers will steal all of your money in less than 30 minutes,"" said David Silver, an attorney who focuses on cryptocurrency.

Silver, whose firm represents the Vidovics, said the top complaints from potential clients are getting locked out of their cryptocurrency exchange platform account and SIM swaps. ""Most people who contact me would tell you it's poor customer service,"" Silver said. ""They're being almost victimized twice. Because they themselves have almost no ability to contact Coinbase and deal with them directly, they're forced to retain professionals."" Etay Maor, senior director of security strategy for cybersecurity company Cato Networks, said he's seen cybercriminals on the dark web discussing how to break into accounts, including those of Coinbase users. Once hackers break into Coinbase accounts, they put them up for sale on the dark web, according to Maor. He said while credit cards sell for a few dollars, hacked Coinbase accounts can sell for $100 to $150. ""These exchanges have to invest heavily, invest in security if they want to take it seriously, just like the banks have done and have learned the hard way,"" Maor said. Account takeovers are on law enforcement's radar. ""When the attacker withdraws those funds from the exchange, that's not a transaction that you can take back,"" Ali Comolli, a management and program analyst at the FBI, told CNBC.

Comolli said the FBI tries to help victims of account takeovers recover their stolen money. ""It's obviously a huge impact on the victims, which is incredibly difficult for them,"" Comolli said. After a review of Coinbase's complaints, the Better Business Bureau in March determined the company has a ""pattern of complaints from customers who state they are locked out of their accounts, even after providing required information or updates."" The organization has received 1,128 complaints in the past three years, according to its website. BBB said it sent a letter to Coinbase in order to address the customers' complaints and receive feedback from any implemented improvements. The group has ""not heard a response from this business, about the situation, pattern of complaints for the last three years,"" Alma Galvan, a marketing and communication manager with the organization, said in an email to CNBC. Some customers with lost funds turn to social media to seek help from Coinbase or find community with other disgruntled users. Members of a 941-person Facebook group called ""Coinbase Corruption/Scandal Awareness Group"" update the page with their struggles to recoup money and accounts. One poster referred to the group as a ""sad party,"" and several have brainstormed new places to report their complaints and new methods to pressure Coinbase into making them whole. Complaints abound on Reddit and Twitter as well, where the company's support accounts often publicly reply to the messages, sometimes writing that they have ""escalated"" the issue to an appropriate team. The Coinbase Support account on Twitter also posts live updates about changes and temporary errors on the exchange platform.

Struggling to keep pace

As the company has scaled into its massive size, customer service practices have changed, former Coinbase employees told CNBC. In Coinbase's early years, employees spoke with customers through a live help chat. Jason Rose, who worked part-time in customer service at Coinbase from 2014 until 2016, said many customers asked for reassurance about cryptocurrency. ""They need that touch of somebody being there while they're going through this complex transaction,"" he said. When Rose worked at Coinbase, he said live chat acted as a sort of ""release valve"" for complaints, particularly helpful in moments of crypto volatility. As the company grew, Rose said, his role changed. Coinbase started a repository of answers to frequently asked questions in order to automate its customer service. Rose said when he left in 2016 Coinbase was starting to phase out live chat. ""The decision to do that was disastrous because the time that it took to respond back to emails took a lot longer than it would for a live chat. So, we went back to the email box, taking five days to complete a problem that could have been solved in a few minutes,"" he said. Jacques Reulet also fielded customer issues and said it was hard to keep up. ""We were very diligent about making sure that everyone who wrote in got a response, but things were getting a little unresponsive towards the end [of my time there],"" said Reulet, who worked in operations and compliance at Coinbase from 2014 to 2015. ""The sheer scale at which the company was growing was a lot to handle. I didn't see that we were keeping up."" On Jan. 15, Coinbase acknowledged that many new and existing customers are experiencing delays in their response time. ""We recognize this is frustrating. This is not the experience we want for you, our customers,"" said Casper Sorensen, vice president of customer experience, in a blog post. A July blog post announced the company's intent to roll out live chat messaging and phone support this year, as well as to expand its customer support team. The customer service issue also came up on an earnings call earlier this month. ""So proud to report that we are doing much better [with customer service], but there's always more to do,"" said CEO Armstrong. ""We've increased the headcount five times or so since January, beginning of this year, working on support specifically."" Coinbase, which declined repeated requests from CNBC for an on-camera interview, instead said in an email, ""Over the years, we've consistently updated our customer support offerings to help us scale. In early 2020, we moved to email as our primary channel of support. Many of our customer inquiries require our agents to conduct a significant amount of research to resolve the issue. And, to avoid long wait times, communicating asynchronously via email was the preferred method. However, we recognize that customers want real-time support, and that's why we're rolling out phone support for ATOs this month and live messaging for all customers later this year."" Asked about the number of customer service complaints, the company said: ""Over the past several years, our customer base grew exponentially. We grew from 43+ million users at the end of 2020 to 68+ million registered users, as of June 30, 2021. Through all this growth, some of our customers unfortunately experienced challenges and delays reaching our support team, which resulted in a negative impact for some of our customers. Improving our customer experience remains a top priority for Coinbase."" The company would not disclose how many customers' accounts have been taken over by fraudsters or the total amount it has refunded customers as a result of hacks. It added that since customers have a two-factor authentication, at the minimum, to access their accounts, only ""a small number (less than .01%) of our customers have been impacted by account takeovers."" Marci Preble, a California-based marketer, said Coinbase did credit her account the approximate amount of her original investment. But she said that was after months of a nightmare of what seemed like endless emails.

NEW DELHI: India ranks 2nd in terms of cryptocurrency adoption is a proof of the growing investor interest around the digital currency. But before you start investing you must know which wallet is the best for storing your cryptocurrency?Read on as we discuss the different types of wallets and their unique features.Interestingly, a crypto wallet is in the form of a device or software that does not store currency, but stores keys for doing transactions, besides helping in encrypting, and signing information. They store the information that keeps your funds safe. Very importantly, Bitcoins and altcoins are not stored in wallets, but in an online ledger called blockchain.The two main kinds of crypto wallets based on internet connectivity and vulnerability are Hot wallets and Cold wallets.* Hot wallets have internet connectivity and help users receive and send tokens, facilitating basic transactions across the internet.* However, they are also most prone to cyberattacks and thefts because of being in online mode.* A more prudent way to use these wallets is by storing a small portion of your crypto holdings in them that you need for immediate investment, and keep the rest in cold wallets.* They exist in offline mode so their security cannot be compromised.* It stores the user's address and private keys and works in conjunction with compatible software in the computer.* They can also be called hardware wallets or offline wallets.Now, Hot wallets can be of three types, depending on the software they use:* These are online services that can be accessed by web browsers on any device. Using them is as easy as signing up for an email account.* Due to open access, it is highly prone to malware, counterparty risks and thefts.* They are good for small transactions and quick investments.Coinbase, MetaChain are some of the web wallets.* A desktop wallet is a software installed on one’s laptop or desktop and provides the user full control over one’s wallet and key.* They are easy to use, give privacy and maintain anonymity.* They need regular clean up and anti-virus checks to ensure security.* When using this wallet, one should try to export a copy of this and store it somewhere else for backup in case of accidental loss of data.* Popular ones are Exodus, Bitcoin core, Armory, Electrum etc.* They work in the same manner as desktop wallets and wallet app can be downloaded on iOS or Android mobile.* They have QR codes for trading in crypto.* They are very convenient to use. Mycelium, Bitcoin wallet are some examples.You also have Hardware wallets that are recommended for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency securely. They can be connected to any device with a USB cable and work like a flash drive. They store keys on physical devices rather than software.While using, a hardware wallet asks for transaction details and validates the data itself. Trezor and Ledger Nano S are some hardware ledgers available in the market. It costs a lot more than a software wallet.Then there are also paper wallets, that as the name suggests exist in the form of paper. They have keys and QR codes like mobile wallets to facilitate crypto transactions. However, they run the risk of being lost or damaged .","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85593013,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35076,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

A 'maximalist' vision of bitcoin means every company will be a crypto company.

Oh what a difference a summer makes.

Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) slow but steady rebound from its spring lows saw the crypto unit top $50,000 on Monday, with the latest move greased by PayPal’s (PYPL) announcement that it would let U.K.-based customers trade in crypto, something U.S. clients had already been offered since October.

It seems like just yesterday (May, to be exact) when Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s off-the-cuff remarks ricocheted across the crypto market, lighting the fuse on a sell-off that eventually dragged bitcoin to its 2021 nadir below $30,000.

At the time, Paul Donovan, UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief economist, declared that the episode served as a “reminder that if one person can dramatically alter spending power, the ‘stable store of value' criteria of a currency is not met.”

Indeed, skeptics have resorted to a slew of aphorisms and adjectives to describe bitcoin (billionaire investor Warren Buffett prefers “rat poison,” for example). “Stable” certainly isn’t among them, with the digital coin prone to dramatic, occasionally double-digit daily price swings that belie its aspirations of becoming a reliable store of value to rival the U.S. dollar.

The latest move punctuates a particularly busy period for the digital currency, and crystallizes something that even its biggest critics have to acknowledge. Cryptocurrency in general, and bitcoin in particular, has been gaining major currency (pun intended) across sectors.

PayPal’s decision is “a sign that every company will eventually be a crypto company — they just don’t know it yet,” Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview on Monday. “And I think this trend is just getting started.”

Story continues

She was only half joking. In addition to the PayPal move, Wall Street is making crypto increasingly available to its clientele, while Facebook (FB) is also making its own ripples in the sector (albeit with a scaled-back version of its original grand design). Separately, trading platforms are clearly reaping the benefits of transacting in crypto (looking at you, Robinhood (HOOD)).

“Crypto’s not a fad. There are elements of this, certainly, that feel a little speculative and bubbly… but if we zoom out and look at the secular 10-, 20-year trend… we view crypto as a fundamental enabling component of this new digital world,” Demirors added.

It cuts to the heart of what noted bitcoin evangelist and crypto investor Anthony Pompliano wrote in a letter to subscribers on Monday. Waxing poetic about how digital currencies were ushering in a “monetary revolution,” Pompliano laid out a vision in which maximizing the use of crypto (i.e. “maximalism”) will eventually make prices far less whipsaw.

“The crazy part is that if monetary maximalism ends up playing out how I believe it will, bitcoin will eventually be incredibly stable in value. The price of goods and services will be denominated in bitcoin and the average bitcoin holder won’t see any level of volatility,” Pompliano wrote.

“When this occurs, people will have a choice to simply spend less than they make in an effort to save bitcoin. Or they will be available to invest in other assets to acquire more bitcoin than what they would simply be allowed to save,” he added.

To be certain, bitcoin’s frothy price and lack of convertibility in the most quotidian transactions (think paying rent, buying coffee and dining out, for example), leaves a lot to be desired for the average citizen. And polling suggests they are still not true believing acolytes like Pompliano and Demirors.

Yet the digital coin’s resilience is nothing to sneeze at. With all due respect to the Oracle of Omaha, its growing credibility among large and small investors is a sign of its maturation, according to Chris Kline, COO and co-founder of Bitcoin IRA.

“The widespread adoption of crypto ranges from governments to major corporations, further legitimizing the seriousness of digital assets,” Kline told Yahoo Finance in an email.

“Make no mistake about it, the world wants crypto to stay. In addition, you’re seeing the adoption of crypto for use in payments, real estate, and art, which are contributing to the rising value of digital assets,” he added.

This marked the first time it exceeded that point in three months. The boost came in light of investors piling onto the crypto coin in a bargain-buying spree. At its peak, the popular cryptocurrency hit a high of $50,152.24, which was up 2.5 per cent since mid-May. Speaking on the recent gains that Bitcoin saw this week, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex said, “If there is an increase in trading volumes and bulls manage to gain momentum, we might see a dash towards $61,000 this week. We are only at the beginning of the week, and things are already looking exciting for the week ahead.""

Cryptocurrency is the new rage for many reasons. It is untraceable, it is secure and it is a good way to make a great deal of money via investments. However, digital currency does come with its own set of drawbacks such as high market volatility, unpredictability and lack of regulation which does not do much to inspire confidence in first-time investors. So, before you dive into the crypto pool, there are a few things you should know.

Trading on Crypto Exchanges: What You Need to Know

Much like buying and selling shared on the stock exchanges, cryptocurrency trading is done primarily through crypto exchanges. These exchanges aid you as the investor to trade cryptocurrencies based on their current market value. This value is determined by demand, supply and the overall condition of the market. There are several layers of fees that you need to be aware of before attempting this.

Exchange Fees

The first level is the exchange fees. This is the amount charged by the exchange to complete a buy or sell order. Most of the exchanges in India have a fixed fee model but the end cost depends on the platform that you opt for. This fee is the primary mode of revenue for these exchanges so keep that in mind when choosing. The fee that these exchanges charge is generally between 0.1 per cent to 1 per cent or more for each trade. This means if you invest around $1,000 in the trade, the commission to the exchange would be around $100 or so.

Network Fees

The essential premise of cryptocurrencies is that they need to be mined using a lot of computer hardware. This network fee goes to the miners who dedicate their time and effort to doing so. It also helps you verify and validate each and every transaction to make sure your crypto coins have not been used before. This fee, however, is not controlled by the exchange and is set in place by the miners and is based entirely on demand. The more traffic on the network, i.e., the higher the demand, the more the fees may increase.

Wallet Fees

A crypto wallet is like an online bank account for your digital coins. It helps keep your cryptocurrency safe. Additionally, it also allows the holder to send and receive coins. Think of it like a Paytm wallet. Most of these wallets do not charge you any fees, but if you opt for a crypto wallet that comes in-built with most exchanges, then you could face an additional wallet handling charge. One would use the wallet to store the cryptocurrency amidst trading. The fees come into play whenever you send crypto coins to someone else. It basically comes in as a form of network fees.

miners to resume their endeavours from September 22. The country had announced restrictive measures in May amid an increasing power deficit causing blackouts in many parts of the country.

China, on the other hand, is decisively cracking down on mining and has no intention of rolling back its cryptocurrency ban.

While Iran is endorsing Bitcoin for self-preservation, China is against decentralised systems to retain maximum control and exert dominance.

Regulations around cryptocurrency saw a lot of upheaval over the past one year world over. While China continues to maintain its strict anti-cryptocurrency stance, other countries — like Iran — are softening their stance.According to Iran's state-owned company for power generation and distribution — Iran Power Generation, Distribution, and Transmission Company (Tavanir) — the ban on cryptocurrency mining will be lifted come September 22.The Financial Tribune reports that the utility will start resupplying electricity to mining farms in a bid to collect what's touted as the world's newest financial assets Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.But, on the other side of the world, in China, the government has warned its local electricity manufacturers to keep from selling its spare capacity to Bitcoin miners, local or otherwise. The companies, located in the provinces where mining has been banned, have till August 24 to completely dismantle mining farms and move any leftover mining equipment out of the area.The county’s Ministry of Industries, Mining, and Trade is expected to give out an official diktat soon, reversing the restrictions applied on all miners in May . Simply put, Iran's national grid will again be fully available for mining cryptocurrencies , a unique initiative to reduce the country's dependence on the globalised US dollar and other fiat currencies.Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, the spokesman of the nationalised energy company, explained that power consumption in the Islamic Republic is expected to decline in the coming months as the summer has ended.The country was forced to take regressive steps like a blanket ban since its power deficit was acutely high in the hot month of May. This led to blackouts and load sheddings in multiple parts of the country. Sincemining is an energy-intensive process, Iran was forced to ration its electricity and crackdown on miners.China is confident it wants nothing to do with cryptocurrencies. At one point, Chinese mines powered nearly 80% of the global trade in cryptocurrencies despite a domestic trading ban since 2017. But all of it came to an abrupt end in May when Beijing swiftly asked provincial governments, regulators, and energy companies to stop supplying energy to mining farms. Miners had little option but to comply and find an alternative plan to keep their business going.Gradually, all miners started migrating out of the country and found a new home in many parts of the US, Kazakhstan, Canada, and even Russia. A recent ruling by a northern Shandong province's high court said that the Chinese law does not protect cryptocurrencies, and the assets never had legal status. The verdict is a final nail in the coffin for cryptocurrencies in the country, and there's little hope of taking a step back.Iran faces severe sanctions from the US and is restricted from directly transacting in the international market. This limits its exposure to the US dollar, which is often considered the de facto globalised currency for trade. Foreign exchange against other fiat currencies is significantly tricky, making it a challenging task to get imports, in turn limiting the scope of growth. This, in turn, makes cryptocurrency an attractive alternative for the country.According to an Elliptic report, Iran contributes 4.5% of all total Bitcoin mining, raking in revenues of nearly $1 billion each year.For China, the ambition is very different. It has always focused on a centrally backed digital currency (CBDC), and its e-yuan experiment is slowly expanding to more and more citizens. At the same time, the government has cracked down on private players in the payments industry, intending to gradually phase out closed ecosystems and creating a centrally controlled digital currency that can be leveraged at an international scale.With its industrial influence rising in south-east Asia, Africa, and other developing markets, China aims to establish a dollar-equivalent at a global scale. Its idea is to dominate the global economy by getting the early-adopter advantage. At the same time, a central system gives it full authority over censorship, surveillance, and even the country's monetary policy.The two countries are in an entirely different scenario and trying to leverage the crypto boom in their favour.

Aussies made more than $10,000 in profit from their cryptocurrency investments in the past 12 months — the equivalent to nearly two months of the average Australian salary.

More than three quarters of Aussies made a profit from their crypto investments over the last year too, according to research from YouGov, with the average profit adding up to $10,662.

But more than one in five Aussie cryptocurrency holders said they made a massive amount of profits worth over $30,000, the survey found.

Interestingly, Aussie parents with children under 18 at home were the most likely to make money from their cryptocurrency trading, with 86 per cent reporting a profit that added up on average to $12,428.

The crypto market ran hot over the last year, said Swyftx head of strategic partnerships, Tommy Honan, an Australian cryptocurrency exchange with more than 320,000 customers, which commissioned the survey.

“So even though we’ve just come out of a dip in the market we’re still seeing a lot of Aussies reporting profits on their trades over the last 12 months,” he noted.

“Aussie millennials and Gen Xers saw especially big returns, with around one in five saying they made more than $20,000 over the last year from cryptocurrency. Aussie mums and dads appear to have been especially successful, as well as men in general and crypto users who report a strong or some understanding of the market.”

Men achieved an average $11,357 profit on their crypto over the last 12 months, while women achieved an average of $9,176, the survey revealed.

In terms of location, crypto users in Brisbane were the most likely to report a profit with 83 per cent making money, followed by Sydney and Melbourne at 76 per cent and then Perth.

Mr Honan said he expected to see further improvements in the market this year following a market fall in May and June.

“Experienced investors have been buying the dip in the expectation that Bitcoin could hit the US $100,000 price by the end of the year,” he said.

But if you’re new to crypto, Mr Honan said it’s best to do your research before buying.

“The group who were least likely to report a profit on their crypto holdings over the last year were people who said they had little or no understanding of the market,” he said.

“At the moment, this is a relatively small proportion of crypto users in the country, just 16 per cent report having little or no understanding. But for this group and anyone who wants to grow their confidence, it really is essential to do your research.”

“Pro tips are to research the team behind any digital assets you are thinking of buying, and also look at indicators like the size of a coin’s market and its liquidity.”

Financial regulators around the world have begun to scrutinise cryptocurrency as they investigate implementing regulations.

In the UK, the financial watchdog has warned that people should be prepared to lose all their money if investing in cryptocurrency, while it also banned trading exchange Binance.

Poly Network, a platform in the decentralized finance or ""DeFi"" space, was hit by a major attack this month which saw the hacker, or hackers, steal more than $600 million worth of digital tokens. The thief exploited a vulnerability in Poly Network's code which allowed them to transfer the funds to their own accounts.

In a strange twist, the Poly Network hacker didn't run off with the haul. Instead, they opened a dialogue with the organization that was targeted, promising to return all the funds. And, sure enough, the hacker gave back nearly all of the money — with the exception of $33 million of tether, or USDT, which was frozen by its issuers.

There was a catch, however. More than $200 million of assets was trapped in an account that required passwords from both Poly Network and the hacker. For some time, the hacker refused to hand over their password, simply saying they would only do so once ""everyone is ready.""

Poly Network pleaded with the hacker, which it is calling ""Mr. White Hat,"" to return the remaining funds. The platform promised to grant the unidentified person a $500,000 bounty for helping it identify a flaw in its systems, and even offered them a job as ""chief security advisor.""

Now, the hacker has finally given Poly Network access to the final tranche of stolen funds. In a blog post Monday, the firm said Mr. White Hat shared the so-called private key needed to regain control of the remaining assets.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929924-1629309517996-gettyimages-959428194-bs_4561.jpeg?v=1629309551',)",none

A strong majority (81%) of the almost 1,300 executives questioned think blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, is broadly scalable and has already achieved mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, 73% think their company should adopt crypto and blockchain or risk losing competitive advantage.

The cryptocurrency traded at roughly $49,400 by the afternoon session, still shy of its all-time high above $64,000 set in April.

The space has seen a boost in the past week on increasing adoption. PayPal said Monday it would open its platform in the U.K. to crypto buying and selling, and Coinbase said last week that it would buy $500 million in cryptocurrency on its balance sheet.

Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Capital, is a bitcoin bull but remains wary of jumping in right here.

""I think it needs to be in your portfolio, but is $50,000 the place to be buying it? I wouldn't chase it,"" Baruch told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Monday.

Bitcoin fell below $30,000 during a summer sell-off. Weakness in recent months was largely tied to a regulatory crackdown in China wherein some mining operations were forced to close. Since a June low of $28,600, it has rallied 73%.

In a separate email to CNBC, Baruch said he owns bitcoin but began to trim his holdings once it bounced back to $45,000 — roughly the same level as its 200-day moving average and a 50% retracement level measured from its April peak and its June low. He said that level could prove a good entry point if bitcoin falls back to it.

The Japanese Liquid exchange reported the unfolding events in a series of tweets.

The company revealed the wallet addresses which were used by the hacker to steal the funds, and temporarily froze all activity on the exchange while assessing the extent of the hack’s impact.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX) and Ripple (XRP) were the main assets targeted in the theft.

Coin mixers that randomly pool and clean cryptocurrencies in a non-custodial fashion have been used by the hackers to get away with almost half the stolen assets. According to chain data, 6,000 Ethereum (ETH) worth a staggering $20m has already been cycled through mixers into new anonymous wallets.

Uniswap was the decentralised platform used to swap ERC20 tokens stolen in the heist for more liquid Ether.

Authorities are working to recover the remaining 9,600 ETH which the hacker is yet to move from their wallet. The Japanese exchange remains hopeful the Ether valued at $32m can be recovered.

Progress was made over the weekend according to updates from Liquid on its corporate blog, the company further announced that it had already significantly ramped up network security to ensure protections against future robberies by crypto gangsters.

A wake up call for the industry

Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technical Officer at the Bitfinex derivatives exchange, pointed to the latest hack as a wake up call for the industry. Using the event as an opportunity to suggest a more unified approach with exchanges and trading platforms working together to increase security measures in crypto.

“Today’s hack at the Liquid exchange is the latest security breach in the digital token space,” he said.

“This is another warning, if one were needed, to everyone.

“The ingenuity of bad actors seeking to breach the security systems of exchanges and trading platforms will not abate. It is therefore imperative that we work together as an industry with all exchanges remaining in a perpetual state of vigilance against such threats.

“While the safeguarding of customer funds is of course an exchange’s number one priority, holders of cryptocurrencies should take all steps necessary to ensure that their funds are safe.

“These include ensuring that they have a cold wallet, two factor authentication, notification messages when funds are withdrawn, and avoiding public WiFi.”

2021-08-26,CNBC,PayPal launches its cryptocurrency service in the UK,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/22/paypal-crypto-service-launches-in-the-uk.html,"PayPal has launched its cryptocurrency service in the U.K. PayPal

LONDON — PayPal is launching its cryptocurrency service in the U.K. The U.S. online payments giant said Monday it would let British customers buy, hold and sell digital currencies, starting this week. It marks the the first international expansion of PayPal's crypto product, which first launched in the U.S. in October last year. ""It has been doing really well in the U.S.,"" Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal's general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies, told CNBC. ""We expect it's going to do well in the U.K."" PayPal's crypto feature lets customers buy or sell bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum or litecoin with as little as £1. Users can also track crypto prices in real-time, and find educational content on the market. Like the U.S. version of the product, PayPal is relying on Paxos, a New York-regulated digital currency company, to enable crypto buying and selling in the U.K. PayPal said it has engaged with relevant U.K. regulators to launch the service.

A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's financial services watchdog, was not immediately available for comment on the announcement.

Growing adoption

PayPal's crypto service is similar to one from U.K. fintech firm Revolut. As is the case with Revolut, PayPal users can't move their crypto holdings outside the app. Although Revolut recently started testing a feature that lets users withdraw bitcoin to their own personal wallets. PayPal says its foray into crypto is about making it easier for people to participate in the market. ""The tokens and coins have been around for a while but you had to be a relatively sophisticated user to be able to access that,"" da Ponte said. ""Having that on a platform like ours makes a really good entry point."" The payments processor is one of many large companies taking a leap into the mostly unregulated world of cryptocurrencies. Despite ongoing concerns about price volatility, consumer protection and potential money laundering in the industry, major firms including Mastercard, Tesla and Facebook have been warming to crypto lately.

Bitcoin, the world's biggest digital currency, hit a record high of nearly $65,000 in April before tumbling below $30,000 in July as Chinese regulators extended a crackdown on the market. It has since recovered to a price of over $50,000. While PayPal started with crypto trading, the company is betting digital currencies will take a greater role in e-commerce in the long run. Earlier this year, PayPal started letting U.S. consumers use crypto to pay at millions of its online merchants globally. The firm also expanded crypto buying and selling to Venmo, its popular mobile wallet. ""We definitely have ambitions to continue to expand the product range in the U.S., the U.K. and other markets,"" da Ponte said. ""We are very deliberate about starting with initial functionality, and then we'll see where the market is going to take us. Different markets have different appetite for products.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929876-1629304059932-Pay_Pal-26.jpg?v=1629306031',)",none

It's been a good few days for bitcoin investors. The digital token is trading at nearly $50,000, its highest point in months. And many people who've stayed on the sidelines are probably wondering yet again: Is it time to buy the cryptocurrency? Before you put your money into the still highly volatile asset, however, there are three helpful things to consider, according to financial and behavioral experts.

1. Suspecting it's a bubble won't save you

Many investors know what a bubble is: It's what happens when an asset's price far exceeds its real value. And many smart people have expressed concern that bitcoin is a bubble. Still, many have invested in the currency with little caution despite their suspicions that its price is unmoored from its value.

It's common for people to buy assets even when they know they're overvalued, ""because they expect prices to go even higher,"" said Bruce Mizrach, an economics professor at Rutgers University's Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences. And, he said, ""they all believe that they can exit before the bubble crashes."" Just remember: That's what everyone else is thinking. ""By the time most individual investors get into a rising investment, it's often too late,"" said Kent Baker, a finance professor at American University.

2. FOMO often backfires

Stories of crypto-millionaires. People buying houses, thanks to bitcoin. How could you not be experiencing a fear of missing out? Investors often fall prey to the social bias of ""herding,"" Baker said. They do what the crowd does, believing that everyone else must know more than they do and that there's safety in numbers. We can't all lose our all money, they may think.

""Generally, such investors are wrong on both counts,"" Baker said. In reality, the other people ""in the crowd,"" are similarly swayed by the same illusions.

3. There's just still so much we don't know","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106931701-1629727861382-gettyimages-1324486089-60cb1c2a22ab9023d36d30a4_1624174305.jpeg?v=1629727952',)",none
2021-08-26,The Economic Times,Will cryptocurrency ever be accepted as a ‘good’ asset class?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/will-cryptocurrency-ever-be-accepted-as-a-good-asset-class/articleshow/85554912.cms,"MUMBAI: The birth of cryptocurrency in 2008 was based on the thought that one day it could act as a common monetary system that would help replace the inefficiencies of the current centralised system around the world.The idea of an internet cash system, built on the then nascent blockchain technology, hoped to allow people to transact with each other without a third-party to verify it, like in a central bank. The peer-to-peer system, born in the midst of the global financial crisis, solved problems that troubled cryptographers since 1992.Fast forward to 2021. Today, more people see cryptocurrencies as a tool for investment rather than a currency. In fact, the view that a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin could become a widely accepted currency is now confined to just Bitcoin maximalists.In India, where cryptocurrency adoption is rising fast, businesses involved in the space are breaking away from the ideas of Satoshi Nakamoto — the pseudonym of the person who developed Bitcoin — to paint cryptocurrencies as an asset class. They are trying to convince the government and the monetary authority against banning this form of digital cash.“There is a big misunderstanding… you can’t have Bitcoin (a deflationary asset) compete with the rupee (an inflationary monetary system),” crypto exchange WazirX’s CEO Nischal Shetty had said in February at the ETMarkets Conclave. “You can’t use Bitcoin for everyday transactions because of its high cost.”But does a cryptocurrency even have the attributes to be a “good” asset class?“Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West. This asset class is rife with fraud, scams and abuse in certain applications. There is a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced and complete information,” US Securities Exchange Commission head Gary Gensler said at a recent event.An asset class is defined as a group of instruments that have similar characteristics and are governed by the same regulations.According to Chakri Lokapriya of TCG Asset Management, a good asset class should have liquidity, stability, value and a low transaction cost. “An asset class that can display stability in most of those characteristics can be termed as a ‘good asset class!’” Lokapriya told ETMarkets.com.Even the most ardent supporters of cryptocurrencies have found it hard to deal with the inherent volatility of these instruments. Cryptocurrencies are often prone to flash crashes that could be due to a number of factors, such as a sudden exit of one large investor or systemic failures at cryptocurrency exchanges.While Bitcoin’s liquidity has improved markedly due to the introduction of bite-size coins called Satoshis, others remain vulnerable to sudden bouts of liquidity drying up. A major concern among cryptocurrency investors has been the large holdings among so-called whale investors, whose exit can create market crashes. Market risk, therefore, is one of the biggest vulnerabilities of owning cryptocurrencies.High transaction costs of trading in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is another factor that works against the asset class. Back in April, the average fee of transacting in Bitcoin was at an all-time high of $59 after China’s crackdown on the country's Bitcoin miners. High transaction fee is also one of the major arguments used by traditional investors to discard cryptocurrencies’ utility as a medium of exchange.Bitcoin’s high transaction fee also emits from the high cost of energy that miners face to keep their mining farms running 24 hours a day. According to some reports, the amount of power used to mine Bitcoin is more than the electricity consumption of Argentina.As for cryptocurrencies’ role as a store of value, the jury is still out. While a Bitcoin today is worth Rs. 36 lakh, many still doubt its ability to act as a stable store of value because of the high volatility associated with it. Bitcoin has been equated with digital gold given that its supply is scarce by design.Sceptics such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb say the true value of Bitcoin is zero. The author and risk analyst said in June that Bitcoin can neither be a short-term or long-term store of value, cannot operate as a reliable hedge against inflation, and “worst of all, does not constitute, not even remotely, a tail protection vehicle for catastrophic episodes”.Yet, many institutional investors and Fortune 500 companies are adopting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a hedge against their expectations of high future inflation as well as black swan events like the Covid-19 pandemic. Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy have already converted part or all of their balance sheet cash into Bitcoin. Recently, a Texas-based biotech company converted its cash into Bitcoin to avoid “overreach from banks”.Technical factors aside, one of the biggest hurdles in accepting cryptocurrencies as a good asset class is because of the regulatory uncertainty. The US SEC has already demanded powers from the Congress to regulate both crypto tokens and the entire decentralised finance framework. In India, crypto investors and crypto entrepreneurs want the government to regulate the industry so as to allow innovation to thrive and address misgivings about the asset’s role in money laundering, fraud and terrorism financing.Wealth managers and advisors speak of high networth investors willing to invest in cryptocurrencies through the right channels but unable to do so out of fear of prosecution.In some countries, regulators have shown a willingness to regulate cryptocurrencies as an asset class and allow asset management companies to launch instruments such as exchange-traded funds, crypto-backed bonds and the likes that provide access to common investors in a risk-controlled environment.Perhaps, among the many problems that cryptocurrencies have to tackle to be acknowledged as a good and viable asset class, regulation could be the first step in the journey.With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman suggesting a more calibrated approach to cryptocurrencies in the proposed cryptocurrency law, investors will hope the death of a utopian-style currency will give birth to the foundation of a stable asset class.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85554970,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76298,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,Euronews,Could Cardano’s 'green' cryptocurrency ADA take over Bitcoin and Ethereum?,https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/23/could-cardano-s-green-cryptocurrency-ada-take-over-bitcoin-and-etherium,"The little known cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) has come out of nowhere to become the third-largest after Bitcoin and Ethereum following a recent price surge as blockchain enthusiasts look for more climate-friendly options.

Cardano’s price has gone up by more than 36 per cent in the last week and its market capitalisation stands at $90.60 billion (€76 billion), according to crypto website CoinMarketCap.

What is Cardano and what are the reasons for its success? Here’s everything you need to know.

What is Cardano?

Cardano is a blockchain platform and it has its own internal cryptocurrency called ADA.

The tokens are named after Augusta ""Ada"" King, or Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century British countess known for her work on a theoretical computation engine. She is largely regarded as the first computer programmer and is the daughter of the poet Lord Byron.

ADA is named after 'Ada lovelace', a 19th-century British countess known for her work on a theoretical computation engine. Cardano website

Cardano was established in 2015 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and was launched in 2017. Since then, the token has returned 7,080 per cent to investors.

Cardano is the largest cryptocurrency to use a proof of stake blockchain model, which is considered a greener alternative.

As crypto enthusiasts become more aware of the environmental impact of cryptos, Cardano has an upper hand over Bitcoin and Ethereum, and this could be one reason for its recent success.

Recent figures from Bitcoinenergyconsumption.com show Bitcoin’s estimated annual emissions is over 57 million tonnes of CO2 per year, which is about the same annual carbon footprint as a small European country.

Meanwhile, Iran and China temporarily banned all crypto mining this summer because computers used in the process were sapping too much electricity and causing power cuts.

Proof of stake works by randomly allocating coins to users, who put up coins for collateral. This differs from the proof of work mechanism - used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum - which requires a global network of computers to run at the same time when a transaction takes place.

This method is designed to encourage increased computing effort for transactions, which uses much more energy than proof of stake.

On its website, Cardano says: ""We have changed science. We have changed what it means to build global systems and sustainable models of exchange and governance.

""We, alongside our community and partners, are defining a new future: a decentralised future without intermediaries, in which power is returned to the individual"".

What are the reasons for Cardano’s success?

Over the last two weeks, the cryptocurrency market has been rallying. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been leading the wave but 'altcoins' - alternative digital currencies to Bitcoin - have also gathered pace in the price race.

Cardano’s price surge came after it announced a major upgrade called Alonzo, which will launch in September.

Alonzo will introduce smart contracts to the blockchain. Smart contracts are programmes stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They are typically used to automate the execution of an agreement and will allow Cardano to deploy their own smart contracts and pave the way for its own decentralised applications (dApps).

Another reason for Cardano’s surge is that from August 25, its coin will be listed on Japan’s exchange after authorisation by the country, which is considered to have one of the strictest criteria for entering the market.

It means Cardano’s ADA will join the elite coins of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin in Japan where it will be put to the test.","('https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/00/50/90/1000x563_cmsv2_510d29c0-64e7-5c4d-9e5e-80b8de1361ed-6005090.jpg',)",none

CAS is the native coin of the Cashaa platform, which offers functions such as speedy processing, discounted set up fees, cheaper international wire cost, rebate in exchange and transaction fees.

Cashaa aims to help crypto businesses access banking infrastructure, and the neo-bank has started rolling out personal accounts across the globe, starting with India.

For this, the neo-bank has tied up with Polygon to reduce the ethereum network fee, which is becoming a bottleneck for small transactions on the network, while at the same time for the enhanced security provided by the network.

Using the bridge, CAS holders will be able to leverage Polygon’s full-stack scaling to minimize transaction fees while transacting with CAS and gain access to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem. Moreover, CAS holders will also be able to stake CAS on the Polygon network to earn up to 30% annually, which will be rewarded in CAS and MATIC tokens.

Matic, is the native currency of Polygon (formerly Matic Network), which was co-founded in 2017 by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun.

“Cashaa has been continuously scaling and now entering into giving personal accounts to increase the adoption of its CAS token, which requires cheaper transaction cost. Association with Polygon is another step towards the same,"" said Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO, Cashaa.

Cashaa will be implementing MATIC tokens in the following products: Cashaa Earn, which earns up to 14% annual interest on deposits; Cashaa Lend, a loan solution of 0% interest rates on cryptocurrency-collateralized fiat loans on bitcoin, Cashaa, ether and matic.

In the last two years, Cashaa has onboarded more than 250 crypto-native businesses who transacted over $1 billion using the Cashaa solution.

In a press release dated August 19, Bitcoin Suisse announced the integrated service named WL Crypto Payments. This omni-channel payment solution will allow all merchants using the Worldline payment services to accept payments in Bitcoin and Ether. The merchants will be able to accept payments in Bitcoin and Ether on point-of-sale (POS) and e-commerce services.

To use this payment service, merchants only need to download the WL Crypto Payments mobile app. They can also install the Worldline payment plugin for their online store.

Clients willing to pay through digital coins may use the mobile cryptocurrency wallet application for this purpose. Prices displayed in Swiss Francs (CHF) will be shown in real-time Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) value, according to the options that a client chooses. The price, to be paid in cryptocurrency, can get confirmed to the merchant instantly.

The transaction is claimed to be safe from volatility risks, as it will be securely converted into CHF after payment is confirmed.

This payment solution was successfully tested in a pilot programme before being rolled out to all Worldline merchants in Switzerland. Worldline and Bitcoin Suisse first collaborated over crypto payments in November 2019.

According to a 2019 press release, the companies intended to reinforce the ""leading position of Switzerland as a strong center in the crypto-financial services industry."" Switzerland houses over 800 companies that offer services or develop solutions for crypto and blockchain companies and is a bustling hub of cryptocurrency growth.

Worldline Switzerland MD Marc Schluep said that this project stood up to their goal of bringing “tangible value to merchants across the globe and to facilitate smooth and modern payments in all the markets"" the firm operates in.

Bitcoin Suisse CEO Dr. Arthur Vayloyan called it a “historic milestone for crypto adoption in Switzerland and beyond,” and added that this step proved yet again that Switzerland was the leader in collaborative innovation and a pioneer in the crypto and blockchain industry.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_ether_stock_unsplash_1629707389109.jpg',)",none

It's been a turbulent few months for cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin, which hit an all-time high of nearly $90,794 in April, plummeted to as low as $40,228 in June after China escalated its crackdown on digital currencies.

Bitcoin, which had been hovering between $41,905 and $55,873 for many weeks, began to rise out of its slump last month, when major tech giants signaled — or appeared to signal — their support for digital currencies.

In July, Amazon posted a job opening for a digital currency and blockchain product lead, sending cryptocurrencies soaring.

At the current price of $2.82, Cardano’s market capitalisation stands $90.60 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Its price has gone up by nearly 11.3 percent in the last 24 hours. Its year to date is also much higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum as it is currently at 1,444 percent.

The cryptocurrency market has been rallying in the last two weeks with the total market capital surging past $2 trillion. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been leading after they plummeted in mid May. Meanwhile, new altcoins have also rallied in the price race.

Cardano is a proof of stake blockchain and is considered a direct rival of Ethereum and Solana. Its recent price surge came after the upcoming ‘Alonzo’ upgrade was recently announced.

The update which will be launched in September is expected to introduce smart contracts to the blockchain. “It's an important moment, marking significant progress in the rollout of #smartcontracts on the #Cardano mainnet which is targeted for the end of August/early September,” the development team said in a Twitter post adding that it has begun test net as well.

The most popular cryptocurrency has been trading in the green with a market cap of more than $921 billion.With 76 lakh users, WazirX has witnessed a massive 2,648 per cent growth in user signups from tier 2 and 3 cities in the country, observing higher participation from women from smaller towns compared to their urban counterparts.The cryptocurrency exchange has clocked $21.8 billion in overall trading volume since January 2021.'We welcome the government's move on the cryptocurrency bill and wish that cryptocurrencies will not only become available for mainstream investors but also to those who have an inclination to try the new asset class. We already have our own self-regulatory code of conduct and best practices in place for our users,' Shetty told IANS.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last week that she is awaiting an approval from the Cabinet on the bill on cryptocurrency.The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has said it may come out with a model of central bank digital currency (CBDC) as early as the end of 2021. A CBDC is a virtual currency issued by the central bank and has a sovereign backing, unlike other digital currencies.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, however, has flagged his major concerns over cryptocurrencies to the government.In its circular on April 6, 2018, the central bank had prohibited banks from dealing in cryptocurrencies or offering any such service to the customers.The circular was challenged in the Supreme Court , which set aside the rules on March 4 last year.'A digital coin by the RBI will be the key step to popularise cryptocurrencies in India,' said Shetty.'With expanding Internet access in a mobile-first country, people can start trading at ease as no bank account would be needed. The settlement period is easier, faster and 24/7 with crypto,' he added.According to him, smaller towns are fast picking up on crypto which is spreading deeper into the tier 2, 3 and 4 cities.Tier 2 and 3 cities have driven almost 55 per cent of total user signups on WazirX in 2021, overtaking tier 1 cities which demonstrated a signup growth of 2,375 per cent.Moreover, women from these regions contribute to 65 per cent of the total signups by women from all over the country.'Crypto has immense potential to remove the financial barriers for rural India, and provide cheaper access to capital, more online jobs,' Shetty noted.Crypto assets are moving towards becoming mainstream with many brands around the world accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85556232,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-105105,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none

A new crypto tab will be added to the PayPal platform, showing real-time currency prices as well as offering educational content to help answer common questions and learn more about cryptocurrencies, including the potential risks, PayPal said.

The payment giant said it hoped that the move to embrace the currency would help improve knowledge and understanding of it.

Cryptocurrencies remain controversial because of their lack of regulation and volatile value fluctuations, and some critics have raised concerns about the anonymity offered to users as part of transactions, arguing the currencies are being used by cybercriminals to hide their activities.

Jose Fernandez da Ponte, vice president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said the firm’s new service could help introduce more people to the technology and how it works, helping to better shape the role the currencies could play in the future.

“The pandemic has accelerated digital change and innovation across all aspects of our lives, including the digitisation of money and greater consumer adoption of digital financial services,” he said.

“Our global reach, digital payments expertise, and knowledge of consumer and businesses, combined with rigorous security and compliance controls provides us the unique opportunity, and the responsibility, to help people in the UK to explore cryptocurrency.

“We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce.”

PayPal confirmed the new service would begin rolling out this week and would be available to all eligible customers within the next few weeks.

The firm has previously launched a similar service in the US, which now also allows users to make purchases at participating businesses using cryptocurrencies – a feature that has not yet been confirmed for release in the UK.","('https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/headerImage-71ba514c-1f41-4709-8079-5ea18a9186cb/ed1e165003c929e19b519fd339733994/headerImage-71ba514c-1f41-4709-8079-5ea18a9186cb',)",none

Available on both its app and website, the service will initially be limited to four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.

It comes after the launch of the same service in the US which was then followed by a Checkout with Crypto feature, enabling PayPal users to actually spend their crypto when making purchases with online merchants.

The volatility and lack of regulation around cryptocurrencies, which are considered private money under English law, has often been seen as an impediment to their adoption by large payment companies such as PayPal.

Critics have often flagged how the potential anonymity offered by using crypto online has empowered cyber criminals and fraudsters operating on the internet.

Jose Fernandez da Ponte, vice president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said his company's new service could help introduce more people to cryptocurrency.

""The pandemic has accelerated digital change and innovation across all aspects of our lives, including the digitisation of money and greater consumer adoption of digital financial services.

""Our global reach, digital payments expertise, and knowledge of consumer and businesses, combined with rigorous security and compliance controls provides us the unique opportunity, and the responsibility, to help people in the UK to explore cryptocurrency.

""We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce.""

PayPal said the new service would begin to be available this week and all eligible customers should be able to access it through a new cryptocurrency tab within the next few weeks.

It is not clear if and when the company will allow consumers in the UK to pay merchants using cryptocurrency.

PayPal hopes its service can address concerns about the volatility of the cryptocurrency by the settling the transaction in fiat cash, meaning merchants won't have to accept the risk themselves.

The company said it will not charge a transaction fee for people using a cryptocurrency at checkout, and that only one type of coin could be used with each purchase.","('https://e3.365dm.com/21/03/1600x900/skynews-paypal-building-hq_5323846.jpg?20210330110050',)",none

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reached as high as $50,152.24, the highest since mid-May, up 2.5%.

Bitcoin has recovered after trading in a range of about $30,000 to $40,000 for many weeks, after it plunged from a record near $65,000 in mid-April. Still, it’s up significantly in the past year.

As per CoinDesk, Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, surged to $3,321. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was trading at $0.32, up 1%. Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also were trading with gains over the last 24 hours.

The worldwide crypto adoption grew by 880% between June 2020 and July 2021, according to the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain data platform Chainalysis. India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption worldwide behind Vietnam, but ahead of countries such as the US, UK, and China, as per the report.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped Bitcoin rally.

In another news, PayPal Holdings Inc will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week. The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class, reported Reuters.

The total market value of cryptocurrencies was at $2.17 trillion on Sunday, according to data from CoinGecko.com, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The overall value has been helped in the past seven days by the 18% rally in Cardano and Binance Coin’s 11% gain, while Dogecoin is up about 9% over the period and Solana 73%, CoinGecko pricing showed.

Bitcoin's price hover around $50,000

Cryptocurrency prices continue to be in the red on August 23. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $2.13 trillion, a 1.37 percent increase over the last day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $93.71 billion, which makes a 13.09 percent decrease.

2021-08-26,NDTV Gadgets 360,"What Are Cryptocurrencies? Making Sense of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ether, and the Rest",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/opinion/what-are-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-dogecoin-ether-2514871,"To understand cryptocurrency, you need to understand how money works, and what makes these new assets useful, and potentially also usable as currency in the future. First, there was ""physical"" money - notes and coins. Then came e-Money - the numbers that show in your e-banking apps. Both these are issued by the Government.

And then came cryptocurrency, a type of electronic money that is not issued by any Government. It is also called Math Money because it is created and managed using blockchains which are computer networks powered by advanced mathematics. Today, the use case for cryptocurrency is mostly its value as an asset, while the underlying blockchain technology is already powering a number of applications. But the future of money could look very different.

1. What is blockchain?

Let's say Svetlana borrows 10,000 Rupees from me. She is supposed to return it in a week but doesn't. I remind her but she has conveniently ""forgotten"" about it. What can I do? Nothing, except never lending her anything ever again! True story.

Now suppose, at the time of lending the money, a few friends are present. They all clicked a pic or shot a video of me lending Svetlana the money and her promising to return it in a week. And each of these friends posts the pic/ video on Instagram, Facebook, etc. Now that is solid evidence. And Svetlana can't really delete all these videos/ pics from the Internet.

Now that's something like a blockchain.

A blockchain is typically a bunch of computers (nodes) connected to each other. All of these computers contain the same information (e.g. a ledger of transactions). To ""hack"" this information, you will need to ""hack"" most of these computers at the same time. And that's a pretty tough thing to do!

There are many blockchains in the world. The Bitcoin Blockchain is the first and oldest one. It records all transactions of the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Anyone can run a node of this blockchain. All you need is a computer with enough storage space and a strong Internet connection.

2. How are cryptocurrencies created?

There are 2 common ways of creating crypto-currencies. One is the style used by Bitcoin and the other is the style used by Ethereum.

In the Bitcoin-style, there are a bunch of computers called miners who are constantly trying to solve mathematical puzzles. Roughly every 10 minutes, one of these miners wins this race to solve the puzzle. This miner wins a reward which is currently 6.25 bitcoins. That's about Rs. 2 crores. Yes, you read that right. Every 10 minutes there is someone getting 2 Crores worth of bitcoin.

But don't get too jealous of these miners. They have to spend tons of money on computers and electricity. And they can never be sure how much they will actually end up earning.

Many years ago anyone could mine or create bitcoins using a laptop! Well, not anymore. Today you need a ton of computing power for this. In case you want to understand this concept of mining in all its complicated tech glory, you can download the free Future Money Playbook that I have written.

In the Ethereum-style, you can create your own crypto in minutes. My daughters were quite fed up hearing about Dogecoin. So they decided to create their own cat-based cryptocurrency. All they needed to do was customize a ""smart contract"" and publish it to the Ethereum blockchain. That's it! In a few minutes, they had created a new cryptocurrency with a supply of 7 billion tokens - one for each human on Earth. True story.

3. What are the types of cryptocurrencies?

There are 3 common types of cryptos - medium of exchange, utility coin, and stablecoins.

A medium of exchange crypto can be used to buy and sell stuff. Examples are Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Monero. These are the types that Governments hate. That's because they can be used by criminals. But hey, criminals can also use cash! So it's a little unfair to blame these poor little cryptos.

Then there are utility coins. Just like oil ""fuels"" the global economy, utility coins, like Ether, ""fuel"" blockchain-based businesses.

And finally, there are stablecoins. These are backed by normal fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Japanese Yen.

4. Numbers don't lie

The world's first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin (BTC). It is a medium of exchange crypto with a total worth of more than $880 billion. And the world's largest bank, JP Morgan Chase is worth $470 billion.

The world's most popular utility coin is Ether (ETH) with a total worth of $377 billion. India's largest bank, HDFC Bank, pales in comparison with a total worth of $140.37 billion.

Tether (USDT) is the most popular stablecoin with a total worth of $64 billion. Doesn't seem much? Well, that's also the size of ICICI Bank!

2021-08-26,NDTV Gadgets 360,Cryptocurrency Predictions: What Is Pivot Point and How Is It Calculated,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/pivot-point-calculator-cryptocurrency-predictions-market-trends-trading-bull-bear-2516330,"There is no dearth of technical terms in cryptocurrency trading. One of the reasons for this is the relatively new nature of the market. However, in many ways, trading in cryptocurrency is similar to trading in equities or stocks. Both are speculative with a varying degree of risks and investors in both markets often depend on their reading of a few parameters to gauge the overall trend. One of these parameters is pivot points. Investors calculate these points based on the high, low, and closing prices of previous trading sessions to see whether they should stop or double down on their investments.

What are pivot points?

A pivot point is found through technical analysis and is an indicator of the overall trend of the market. It is simply the average of the high, low, and closing prices from the previous trading day or session. If the market the next day runs above the pivot point, it is considered that the market is showing bullish sentiment. If not, it could be time to stop and rethink your investment strategy.

When pivot points are combined with other technical tools, they throw up a broad picture about an asset, as well as the support and resistance levels during a short-term trading session.

How are pivot points calculated?

Pivot points can be calculated in several ways. But the most common of them is a five-point system. This method uses the previous session's high, low, and close data — along with two support levels and two resistance levels. Using these price points, a pivot point is calculated. The equation for calculating a pivot point is given below.

Pivot Point = (Previous High + Previous Low + Previous Close) divided by 3

The equation to calculate support levels is:

Support 1 = (Pivot Point x 2) − Previous High

Support 2 = Pivot Point − (Previous High − Previous Low)

To find the resistance levels, use this equation:

Resistance 1 = (Pivot Point x 2) − Previous Low

Resistance 2 = Pivot Point + (Previous High − Previous Low)

These results are used to plot a course for five levels: two resistance levels, two support levels, and a pivot point. Collectively, the method is known as the five-point system. This system allows traders to define an area where the price seems most sensitive and is likely to cause a shift in the market sentiment.

Time frames

The common practice is to use pivot points for smaller time frames — at most for 4-hour charts and for as small as 15-minute charts.

Types of pivot points

There are five types of pivot points. Apart from the pivot point finding method discussed above (Standard Pivot Point), there are Camarilla Pivot Point, Denmark Pivot Point, Fibonacci Pivot Point, and Woodies Pivot Point.

How are pivot points different from other indicators?

Instead of relying on the current price movement, the pivot point system makes use of the previous day/ session's price data. This approach provides traders with an early signal of the things to come so they can plan accordingly. The pivot points remain static until the start of the next trading session.

Limitations of pivot points

Experts say pivot points are suited only for intra-day trading as they are based on simple calculations and may not hold true during swing trading. Also at times, volatile price movements can completely disregard pivot point predictions. When volatility is high, experts say it's best not to depend on pivot points as price fluctuations are rapid and wide for any predetermined calculation strategy.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Market_crash_Reuters_1621501462274.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,Cointelegraph,"Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, ADA, AVAX, CAKE, ATOM",https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-ada-avax-cake-atom,"Bitcoin (BTC) is knocking at the doors of the key $50,000 level, and most traders are still optimistic, even after the digital asset rallied 70% from the July 20 low at $29,278 to an intraday high at $49,757.04 on Aug. 21.

Monitoring resource Material Indicators pointed to a lot of puts at the $50,000 strike price and the “positive funding almost across the board (overheated),” which suggests a rejection at the current levels and a “pullback going into September.”

Nikita Ovchinnik, chief business development officer of 1inch Network, said that several new institutional investors began adding exposure to crypto in the past year, and that “They didn't come for short-term gains.”

Another positive sign for the crypto sector is the ever-growing list of unicorns. Analysts expect more companies to join the list as the adoption of crypto and blockchain increases.

Will Bitcoin’s hesitation near the $50,000 mark shift the focus to altcoins? Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that are likely to attract traders' attention in the short term.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded off the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($45,049) on Aug. 19, and the bulls pushed the price above the stiff overhead resistance at $48,144 on Aug. 20. The bears are currently attempting to stall the up-move at the psychological resistance at $50,000.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bulls do not give up much ground and flip the $48,144 level to support, it will indicate strength. The BTC/USDT pair could then pick up momentum and start its northward march toward $58,000.

The rising 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

Alternatively, if bears pull the price below $48,144, the pair could drop to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) ($45,816). This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could embolden the bears.

The sellers will then try to sink the price below the breakout level at $42,451.67. If they succeed, it will suggest the start of a deeper correction.

The four-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the zone between $49,500 and $50,000. If they can sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $46,600 and then to $44,000.

If that happens, it will suggest that the bulls are losing their grip and the pair could then remain range-bound between $44,000 and $50,000 for a few days. The bears will have to pull the price below $42,451.67 to gain the upper hand.

ADA/USDT

Cardano (ADA) is in a strong uptrend. The bulls pushed the price above the all-time high at $2.47 on Aug. 20, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick showed selling at higher levels. The altcoin formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on Aug. 21, indicating indecision among bulls and bears.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The uncertainty resolved to the upside on Aug. 23 as the bulls have again pushed the price to a new all-time high. If buyers sustain the price above the breakout level at $2.47, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $3.

However, the long wick on the Aug. 23 candlestick suggests that bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They will try to pull the price back below $2.36 and trap the aggressive bulls. If that happens, the pair may correct to $2.20.

If the price rebounds off $2.20, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. A breakout and close above $2.47 to $2.65 will enhance the prospects of the continuation of the uptrend. Alternatively, a break below $2.20 could pull the price down to $1.94.

The four-hour chart shows that the 20-day EMA is sloping up but the RSI is forming a negative divergence. This suggests that the bullish momentum may be slowing down. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA.

Contrary to this assumption, if bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest strength. That could attract further buying, and the pair may then rally to the psychological resistance at $3.

AVAX/USDT

Avalanche (AVAX) rallied from $18.41 on Aug. 17 to $50.27 on Aug. 21, a 173% rally within a short time. This sharp up-move has pushed the RSI above 92, indicating the rally is over-extended in the short term.

AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The long wick on the Aug. 21 candlestick shows that bears are attempting to defend the psychological resistance at $50. On the downside, the first support is at $40. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that bulls are not booking profits aggressively, as they anticipate the rally to continue further.

A breakout and close above $44 could improve the prospects of a retest of the all-time high at $60.30.

On the contrary, if bears pull the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $38.09, the AVAX/USDT pair could correct to the 50% retracement level at $34.34. A break below this support will indicate that the bullish momentum may have weakened.

The four-hour chart shows that bears are attempting to stall the relief rally at the overhead resistance at $44.60 and the bulls are buying on dips to $40. This suggests that the pair could remain range-bound between these two levels in the short term.

If the bulls drive the price above $44.60, the pair could rally to $50.27. A breakout and close above this level will signal the resumption of the uptrend. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate that traders are booking profits and not buying the dips. That could signal the start of a deeper correction.

CAKE/USDT

PancakeSwap (CAKE) is currently in a strong recovery. Sustained buying by the bulls pushed the price above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $22.74 on Aug. 20.

CAKE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bulls sustain the price above $22.74, the relief rally could reach the 50% retracement level at $26.85 and then the 61.8% retracement level at $30.96. The bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance in this zone.

On the way down, the critical support to watch out for is the 20-day EMA ($20.37). If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest that sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA could open the doors for a further decline to $16.

The four-hour chart shows the price is trading inside a rising wedge pattern. If bears sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to the support line of the wedge. This level is likely to act as strong support, and a sharp rebound off it will indicate that traders are buying on dips.

A breakout and close above $24.65 will suggest the resumption of the up-move. The next target objective on the upside is the resistance line of the wedge. The bullish momentum could pick up if bulls thrust the price above the wedge.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) had been trading in a large range between $8.51 and $17.56 since late May. The bulls pushed the price above the resistance of the range on Aug. 18, clearing the path for a possible move to the pattern target at $26.61.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the long wick on the Aug. 23 candlestick and the RSI above 83 suggest the rally is overextended in the short term. This could attract profit-booking by the bulls, resulting in a minor correction or consolidation in the next few days.

If bulls do not give up much ground and flip the $17.56 level into support, the ATOM/USDT pair will again try to resume the uptrend. A break above $26.61 could open the doors for a rally to $28 and then to $30.

The bears will have to pull and sustain the price below $17 to invalidate the bullish sentiment.

The four-hour chart shows that bears are mounting a stiff resistance near $24. Although bulls had pushed the price above this resistance, they could not sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.

A positive sign is that buyers are not dumping their positions in a hurry. The pair could consolidate between $21 and $24 for some time. A breakout and close above $24 will indicate strength and signal the resumption of the up-move.

Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate the start of a deeper correction to $17.56.

2021-08-26,CNN,"For the crypto world, bipartisan infrastructure package brings a 'political awakening'",https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/22/politics/crypto-political-awakening-infrastructure-package/index.html,"Washington, DC (CNN) Members of the cryptocurrency world are donating to crypto-focused organizations, hiring lobbyists and ramping up advocacy efforts in a push to get lawmakers on board with the industry, as pressure builds on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to address a cryptocurrency provision of the bipartisan infrastructure bill before a vote in the House.

""The crypto world has been made politically aware,"" said Anne Fauvre-Willis, chief operating officer at Oasis Labs, a blockchain privacy company. ""For many there has been a personal political awakening.""

The push follows a back-and-forth debate between Senators and dueling amendment proposals earlier this month that would have modified language included in the bipartisan infrastructure package meant to regulate cryptocurrency -- which uses blockchain technology for online transactions.

Despite the debate, a cryptocurrency language compromise amendment failed before final passage of the legislation in the chamber Tuesday, leaving crypto advocates concerned for the fate of an industry they are personally invested in and care deeply about.

As it stands, the provision would impose more federal regulation on cryptocurrencies and could dramatically expand the number of cryptocurrency users who would have to report filings to the Internal Revenue Service -- something that has struck a nerve with supporters of an industry designed to take out intermediaries and grant autonomy to its users via a decentralized system.

While a small number of advocates with cryptocurrency think tanks and associations have been making noise in DC for years, leaders in the crypto space told CNN that the recent debate over cryptocurrency regulations on Capitol Hill caught the attention of thousands of people who were previously disengaged from politics.

""There is a whole new swath of people paying attention to what's happening in Washington,"" said Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, a cryptocurrency research and analysis firm.

Like Fauvre-Willis, Selkis told CNN the conversation around cryptocurrency in DC prompted an ""awakening for many people.""

The birth of the 'crypto voter'

Since early August, the phrase ""I am now a single issue voter,"" has gone viral among crypto circles on Twitter, flooding the feeds of both high profile crypto leaders and ordinary traders who have racked up thousands of likes and hundreds of retweets for sharing that they will only vote for candidates supportive of the booming industry.

Selkis' own Twitter bio reads, ""single issue voter: anti-crypto politicians should be afraid.""

But according to members of the crypto community, while ""crypto voters"" may prioritize protecting the booming industry, they don't yet belong to one party or the other.

For her part, Evan Greer, who for the past decade has organized large-scale online protests in support of net neutrality and in opposition of internet censorship and government surveillance, said that in her experience, ""Tech issues often fall outside of the historical Democrat vs. Republican partisan divide.""

""These are fundamental issues, about how people orient toward institutions of power whether that's corporate power or government power,"" Greer -- director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights nonprofit -- told CNN.

""Among young folks especially, there is skyrocketing skepticism about arbitrary forms of power, either from the government or corporations, and we see that play out in the crypto community,"" Greer said. ""The traditional left-right party politics that have dominated US politics for young people are really starting to erode.""

Push to protect crypto industry goes beyond social media

Earlier this month, 25 new companies have expressed interest in joining the Blockchain Association -- a trade association with 46 existing member companies that works to educate lawmakers on and improve public policy around cryptocurrency.

""This is a pivotal moment for the crypto ecosystem because it was the first time that so many people have in a unified way reached out to the Senate [and lawmakers] and let them know this is a super vibrant, super creative group,"" said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.

In recent months, the Blockchain Association beefed up its lobbying operation, Smith, who has been with the association for three years, told CNN. The group has an internal Republican lobbyist, internal Democratic lobbyist and three lobbying firms on retainer.

Smith, who is also registered to lobby, told CNN that member companies are now hiring lobbyists or lobbying firms too.

Asked why those unfamiliar with the crypto space may care about the recent cryptocurrency advocacy push, Smith said it comes down to a belief in the benefit of having autonomy over one's financial transactions.

""Even if you don't understand the tech [behind crypto], the ability to use your money and data in the way that you want to use it and to have a digital life where you're not at the mercy of intermediaries is something that should be attractive to a lot of people,"" she said.

Coin Center, a think tank started in 2014 that focuses on cryptocurrency policy, has seen ""a surge"" in donations both from individuals and corporations, Neeraj Agrawal, the organization's director of communications, told CNN.

Since August 1, the organization has received gifts from more than 350 individual donors, he said.

And Fight for the Future -- which directed more than 40,000 people to their online portal to call to Senators earlier this month, urging the lawmakers to scale back the proposed cryptocurrency regulations -- has since received more than $20,000 in donations to their organization, mostly given in cryptocurrency.

Creators and users of cryptocurrency, ""have now woken up to the fact that government can kick down your door and shut down your cool project,"" Greer said.

""Any lawmaker that wants to get support from young voters needs to show they aren't utterly ignorant about these issues,"" Greer said.

Fight for the Future will use the donations to support the push to protect crypto in the infrastructure bill, which is moving toward the House of Representatives, Greer said.

The organization will launch a ""full court press"" operation, Greer said, requesting meetings with lawmakers, driving more phone calls and emails to legislators and creating educational videos and explainers.

""All of that costs money,"" she said.","('https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210809123837-crypto-phone-super-tease.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,ABC News,"What to know about 'stablecoins,' the 'bridge' between cryptocurrencies and traditional money",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/stablecoins-bridge-cryptocurrencies-traditional-money/story?id=79500575,"In the exploding realm of cryptocurrencies, a new line of financial products has emerged that has caught the attention of both investors and regulators -- so-called ""stablecoins,"" which are backed by cash or another reserve asset.

Stablecoins seek to provide the best of both worlds: the stability of a traditional government-backed currency as well as the privacy and convenience offered by crypto transactions. They are often marketed towards investors who may not have the stomach for the volatility associated with Bitcoin, Ethereum and other popular cryptos -- which have been known to see-saw widely in value on a day-to-day basis.

The existing stablecoins market is worth some $113 billion, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said earlier this month during a speech at the Aspen Security Forum. He added that in July, nearly three-quarters of trading on all crypto trading platforms occurred between a stablecoin and some other token.

Even social media behemoth Facebook is trying to get in on the action, seeking to launch a stablecoin-like project of its own of its own after its initial Libra cryptocurrency efforts fizzled.

As their popularity rises, stablecoins have also recently drawn new scrutiny from authorities and regulators. Federal Reserve officials mulled over the threats posed by ""new financial arrangements such as stablecoins"" in a recent meeting, according to a readout released earlier this week, raising concerns over the lack of transparency and regulations.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last month also called on regulators to ""act quickly"" in forming new regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, raising alarms over their ""potential risks to end-users, the financial system, and national security.""

Here is what experts say investors should know about the novel class of cryptos dominating headlines in recent weeks.

What are stablecoins?

Stablecoins are essentially cryptocurrencies that are backed by a reserve asset -- usually a traditional currency such as the U.S. dollar. The valuations of stablecoins are therefore supposed to be less volatile than other digital currencies, because they are pegged directly to a fixed, non-virtual currency.

""Think of stablecoin as a cryptocurrency without, or with limited, volatility. That is the best way to think about it,"" Haran Segram, a professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business, told ABC News, adding they are sometimes looked at as ""the bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies."" Fiat currencies are traditional currencies like the dollar, backed by the government.

""Stablecoins are backed by other central bank currencies,"" Segram explained.

Bryan Routledge, an associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, added that this makes stablecoins more useful as an everyday currency.

""For example, the price of Bitcoin is just stunningly volatile,"" he told ABC News. ""That makes it harder to use as a currency."" In 2021 alone, Bitcoin's value has seen swings of 100% -- starting the year at a price of less than $30,000, reaching a peak of over $63,000 in April, before receding back to the $30,000 mark in July. As of Friday, Bitcoin was trading at a little over $46,000.

""When I tell you a latte cost $2.50, you know what that means -- but if I quote a price of a latte in Bitcoin, it's just really hard to keep track of because one day it's the equivalent of $2.50, the next day it's equivalent to $25,"" he added.

Pegging cryptocurrencies to a fixed exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar, as stablecoins attempt to do, makes them ""more useful as a currency,"" according to Routledge.

'It's a stablecoin because they call it a stablecoin'

While this may sound like an overall positive development for everyday investors interested in crypto, experts and authorities have warned of lurking risks associated with the largely unchecked stablecoin market.

Segram noted that one of the most popular stablecoins out there is Tether, which claims to be backed one-to-one to the U.S. dollar.

""The issue with that is some research was done into that, and then actually they found that one unit of that stablecoin is backed by .74 of the U.S. dollar,"" Segram said. ""So things like that, what people put out saying it's a stablecoin, it might not be truly a stablecoin.""

""That's something that investors and your audience should be aware of,"" he told ABC News. ""Because people don't know exactly what's happening in the background, and I would really encourage your readers to be aware of that.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office led an investigation into Tether that said there were periods of time when Tether did not have access to banking and ""held no reserves to back tethers in circulation at the rate of one dollar for every tether, contrary to its representations."" As part of a settlement reached with James’ office, Tether is barred from doing business with New Yorkers but admitted no wrongdoing and pledged increased transparency. The Hong Kong-based entity still maintains on its website, however, that Tether tokens are ""100% backed by Tether’s reserves"" at a conversion rate of one Tether token equaling one U.S. dollar.

""Under the terms of the settlement, we admit no wrongdoing,"" Tether said in a statement on its website in response to the investigation. ""The settlement amount we have agreed to pay to the Attorney General’s Office should be viewed as a measure of our desire to put this matter behind us and focus on our business."" The company added that it is pleased by the ""loyalty"" customers have shown, saying that the market capitalization of tethers grew from $2 billion to an excess of $34 billion during the past two years, while the investigation was ongoing.

""Tether is complicated because it's an international business,"" Routledge added in regards to who regulates it. ""Cryptocurrencies, one of their either charms or weak points, is they don't sort of fall under anybody's direct jurisdiction.""

For most stablecoins, ""it's a stablecoin because they call it a stablecoin,"" Routledge added.

Despite assurances of cash reserves, there is a risk that some stablecoins might operate under the assumption that the likelihood of having to liquidate all at once is slim if confidence remains high.

""If everybody thinks Tether is going to be a stablecoin, it will work as a stablecoin and the few people that need to exchange it at the 'Tether store,' to be colloquial, would do that,"" he said. ""The trouble with that policy is that you can get what the foreign exchange economists would call like a speculative attack, which is that we don't think Tether has enough money, and I think everybody thinks that, they're all going to show up and demand those currencies -- It's a bit like a run on the bank.""

""That's what makes it really hard to stabilize, because your credibility as a stablecoin is the thing that makes it stable, and that's inherently flighty,"" he said.

Why the Fed and Yellen are so concerned about stablecoins

Yellen's calls for quick action on creating regulatory frameworks for stablecoins have been echoed by other lawmakers.

Stablecoins were also recently debated by Fed officials, who ""highlighted the fragility and the general lack of transparency associated with stablecoins,"" at their most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. ""The importance of monitoring them closely, and the need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework to address any risks to financial stability associated with such products.""

Segram said that while stablecoins can ""regulate themselves to some extent by being transparent with the public, I think Yellen is calling for more top-down regulations rather than let it be voluntary.""

This could mean having the reserve currency kept somewhere independent, or having claims be regularly audited, he added.

Segram added that the Fed, meanwhile, might have other concerns around stablecoins' growth.

""If stablecoins become popular, the central bank loses its control,"" Segram said, noting that there have been discussions of stablecoin-like ""Central Bank Digital Currency"" to be issued by the Federal Reserve.

A Central Bank Digital Currency would give the Fed more control ""over how we manage demand, supply and all other means,"" Segram said.

Routledge added that the Fed may also have worries about a ""banking panic"" situation if a lot of assets are flowing through a specific stablecoin.

""If for whatever reason that stablecoin has a shock to it -- that can be a systemic event to the financial system,"" he added. ""That is what's on the Fed's radar.""

SEC Chair Gensler, meanwhile, signaled a regulation crackdown could be looming during his remarks earlier this month in Aspen.

Gensler said the use of stablecoins on crypto trading platforms ""may facilitate those seeking to sidestep a host of public policy goals connected to our traditional banking and financial system: anti-money laundering, tax compliance, sanctions, and the like.""

""This affects our national security, too,"" he added. Gensler said he looks forward to working with regulators and lawmakers on these matters.

Despite the risks, Segram sees cryptocurrencies as the future, which may be in part why regulators are raising alarm bells and why there is so much discussion over a potential central bank digital currency. Major U.S. companies including Amazon and Walmart have recently announced they are hiring cryptocurrency experts, and a growing number of firms have started accepting cryptos as a form of payment.

China's central bank has already launched its digital Yuan, he added, saying that the U.S. most likely will at some point in if it does not want to lose its status as the ""reserve currency of the world.""

""If a stablecoin is issued by a private authority, it is not 100% fail-proof,"" he said. ""In a democracy like ours, or other democracies where there's some political stability and currency stability, a central bank digital currency might be the way to go.""

""I think of stablecoin sort of as a link between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, this takes that to another level,"" he said.","('https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/money-illustration-rf-gty-jc-210820_1629489806353_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg',)",none

NEW DELHI: Cardano, a relatively lesser-known cryptocurrency, has raced to the top three. In its dash to the top, Cardano (ADA) has made a stunning recovery from a $1 trillion crash and occupies the third place after Bitcoin and Ethereum.Cardano’s rise to the top has happened at a time predicted to be a ‘quiet one’ by market analysts. By Friday morning, Cardano (ADA) completed the week-long run registering 10 percent growth. This in terms of crypto gains is a formidable and matchless run.Its volumes swelled on the back of a software upgrade that could help the currency to stand next to Ethereum which is only second to Bitcoin.According to Coindesk, the digital coin hit an all-time high Friday of $2.58, an increase of more than 18 percent. Year to date, it has seen returns of 1,294 per cent recording a recovery of $82 billion, in the process surpassing Binance coin and securing the third position.This unprecedented rally may again continue following the update that is expected sometime on September 12. This phase will allow smart contract functionality and for a range of decentralized finance applications to be used on the Cardano network.Smart contract functions have been the strong points of any cryptocurrency and will continue to be so, for a longer period until an alternative is found to better the trading experience and exchange.Smart contracts are a way to ensure agreements can be validated securely. Ethereum has already arrived at that point and that is said to be its biggest strength.Another upgrade is on the cards when Cardano moves into the third phase known as Goguen . Enough space has been created in this phase to include Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens.It must be recalled that Cardano was founded by the co-founder of Ethereum, Hoskinson four years ago, and if there is anybody in the world of cryptocurrency who knows the major takeaways of Ethereum vis-à-vis Cardano, it is Hoskinson.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85533972,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-301800,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

It was clearly the week of altcoins surging way past the cryptocurrency market formen Bitcoin and Ethereum to make a substantial mark. While Bitcoin ($49,235) saw a 7-day rise of 5.67 percent and Ethereum ($3,236) rose just 0.03 percent in the same time, altcoins like Cardano ($2.53) recorded a weekly jump of 17.47 percent, along with Cardano ($2.53) which spiked 17.47 percent, Polkadot ($27.72) which peaked 23.02 percent, Solana ($74.52), which rose almost 64.85 percent and Terra ($27.94), which hiked 63.44 percent.

Winds of Change

In fact, Cardano, with a current market cap of 80,559,983,767 dollars overtook Binance Coin’s market capitalization ($75,750,693,612) as the third biggest cryptocurrency after Ethereum and Bitcoin. This is mostly thanks to its upcoming Alonzo upgrade, which will incorporate smart contracts, opening a range of applications like DeFi, NFTs, automated lending, and more and giving stiff competition to peers like Ethereum.

Closer home, crypto adoption in India is exponentially growing, with the country ranking second, succeeded by Vietnam amidst the countries that make a lion’s share of cryptocurrency usage, with 9 percent of the respondents claiming to utilize cryptocurrency, per market research firm Finder.

In fact, all five leading nations in terms of bitcoin ownership are located in Asia. Bitcoin (16 percent) is the most popular coin, followed by Ethereum and Bitcoin cash (6 percent) and Ripple (8 percent). While men (32 percent) take precedence over women (23 percent) in terms of possession, young adults (32 percent) aged between 18-24 when it comes to cryptocurrency ownership. Young adults lead the way with 32% of those aged 18-24 have invested in cryptocurrency.

Regulatory woes to end?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clarified the government’s stand on cryptocurrency, stating that the area has a lot of potential in terms of fuelling the country’s fintech sector. Notably, the work on the pending cryptocurrency regulation bill is nearly complete and the cabinet will decide further, with chances of it being presented in the winter parliament session

""We cannot be moving ahead as if this doesn't exist. We are not saying no to cryptocurrency. We are saying we will have to see how this technology can help fintech to maximize the potential it has. But how sophisticated regulation can be is something which I want to work with the RBI,"" she elaborated.

The necessity of regulations in this field, however, was highlighted in the recent case of cryptocurrencies worth 97 million dollars being stolen from the digital currency wallets of Liquid, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange. In the meantime, all deposits and withdrawals on the platform have been suspended.

Furthermore, terrorist groups like ISIS have begun receiving funds in bitcoins as well, External Minister S Jaishankar said. The money flow, resource mobilization, and killing rewards to ISIL (Daesh) in Syria, Iraq, and its affiliates in Africa have increased in recent times, he explained.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/08/cryptocurrency-770x433.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,Analytics Insight,Acceptance of Cryptocurrencies and Their Popularity,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/acceptance-of-cryptocurrencies-and-their-popularity/,"Acceptance of Cryptocurrencies and Their Popularity

Going down the memory lane, back then, the world of cryptocurrencies was considered to be fraudulent and a market that had no intrinsic value. Who knew the story would take a 360-degree turn and leave us talking about how, when, and how much to invest in cryptocurrencies, like never before? Today, the investment in cryptocurrencies is not just limited to big corporate companies but to retail investors as well. Companies taking initiatives to align their operations with the crypto industry comes as no big a surprise. This, ultimately, has become a major contributor to the ever-growing digital economy.

Though a lot of people across the globe are quite familiar with the concept of cryptocurrencies, at least to some extent, what is worth taking note of is the fact that cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies were a relatively small and sophisticated niche of the tech industry about a decade ago. Lack of understanding has always been a concern. In addition to this, the governments and financial regulatory agencies have not been that welcoming when it comes to the crypto industry. Consider – India. In India, the entire banking industry and also the companies in the jurisdiction of the Reserve Bank of India have been strictly banned from interacting with crypto technology. Though the Supreme Court had to intervene and see if the reversal of this ban could be done, there is still a lot of speculation that the government might be planning an outright ban on cryptocurrencies. But, since nothing stands certain, the companies and retail investors have got no choice but to wait till the final decision is out.

All this while, not much has been said about how the crypto industry facilitates seamless cross-border cash transfers, addresses the inflation problem, or helps in eradicating corruption. All this has paved the way for the assumption that cryptocurrencies are bad. However, the situation seems to have changed drastically. What we get to see today is the manner in which companies are exploring ways to embrace cryptocurrencies. A lot of companies and startups have come to terms with the efficiency that cryptocurrencies bring to the business. The last two years saw industry players like MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal leaving no stone unturned to embrace crypto by allowing their clients to buy crypto and engage with other crypto services like paying with crypto via their systems. On the other side, we get to see a lot of organizations taking steps to throw light on how various companies and investors can benefit from the cryptocurrency market. They have gone a step ahead by providing step-by-step tutorials on how both – individuals as well as companies can start investing in cryptocurrencies.

What has turned out to be rewarding is that a lot of the regulators have become relatively lenient. For example, in India, where the RBI had banned cryptocurrencies, speculation that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the Republic of India might be created, serves to be a ray of hope. At the global level, too, there is a positive vibe regarding the same. Companies across the globe have just realized the need to incorporate cryptocurrency and its underlying technology in their operations and are still exploring ways in which they can make the best possible use of this technology to reap maximum benefits. Hence, looking forward to seeing several companies launch different crypto-related programs, declare crypto investments in their balance sheets, and start processing crypto payments for goods and services wouldn’t be surprising at all. In the coming days, one can expect investment firms to launch more crypto-themed products and banks to broaden partnerships with reputable crypto exchanges. All in all, the crypto market has a lot to offer in the days ahead.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency.jpeg',)",none

2021-08-26,Yahoo Finance,"Ethereum Classic Stops For Gas, Along With Bitcoin And Doge, On Bullish Moon Trip",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-classic-stops-gas-along-145939300.html,"On Saturday morning Ethereum Classic (CRYPTO: ETC), along with apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and the ever-popular Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), was consolidating Friday’s bullish trek north. All three cryptos have recently had a relative strength index (RSI) of over 70% which puts them into overbought conditions for technical traders.

A cryptocurrency, like a stock, always enters into a period of consolidation after either a large incline or decline. Ethereum Classic rose 137% between its June 22 low of $32.17 and its Aug. 15 high of $77.37. Although bulls would love to see the original Ethereum version ‘moon’ it will need to stop for gas along the way.

The Ethereum Classic Chart: On Aug. 7 Ethereum Classic broke up from a descending trendline that had been holding the crypto down since June 3. After busting up through the trendline Ethereum Classic soared about 46% over the course of nine days.

When the crypto reached its $77 high its relative strength index measured in at 79% which was a sell signal. The crypto then retraced about 22%, which cooled its RSI down to a much more comfortable 57%, before making another bullish move up.

In its consolidation Ethereum Classic has created another descending trendline which it has now rejected on four separate trading days. For technical traders a trendline must demonstrate support or rejection at least three times to be valid. Ethereum Classic rejected from its new trendline on Aug. 15, 16 and 20 and on Saturday morning the crypto tried to jump over it but failed.

As of 10:00 a.m. ET Ethereum Classic’s trading volume was about 143 million compared to its average 10-day volume of 547 million. When a crypto or stock trades down on low volume it is usually a bullish consolidation as opposed to a bear break.

Ethereum Classic is trading over the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending above the 21-day, both of which are bullish indicators. On Saturday morning the crypto tested the eight-day as support and held above it. Ethereum Classic is also trading above the 200-day simple moving average indicating overall sentiment is bullish.

Story continues

Bulls want to see big bullish volume come in and drive Ethereum Classic up over the descending trendline. If the crypto can clear the level it has resistance above at about $72 and $79.

Bears want to see big bearish volume come in and drop the crypto down below support at the eight-day EMA. If Ethereum Classic loses the support level it could fall toward $65. Below that there is support near the $57 mark. etc_aug._21.png

2021-08-26,NDTV.com,"Here's How You Can Invest In Bitcoin, Ethereum, Other Crypto Coins In India",https://www.ndtv.com/business/crytocurrency-in-india-heres-how-you-can-invest-in-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-other-coins-in-india-2515676,"In India, some popular exchanges are WazirX, CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Cryptocurrency has become a lucrative financial asset for investors these days with its scope to provide steady returns, despite its volatile nature. Being a form of a digital asset, cryptocurrency is primarily based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. The decentralized structure of the virtual currency allows it to exist without the control of governments or regulation of any central authority.

Ever since billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla Inc invested in the world's largest cryptocurrency- bitcoin, leading crypto coins such as ethereum, dogecoin, and bitcoin have caught the attention of the bigger investors as well as the common man.

In India, many are still advocating the classification of cryptocurrency as an asset. Recently, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the cabinet note on the cryptocurrency bill is ready and the Cabinet is yet to clear the same. Presently, cryptocurrencies are under no regulation in the country, which often makes it risky for investors.

However, one must know the basic steps of investing in cryptocurrency. Here is how you can invest in crypto coins such as bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin in India:

Step 1: Find the right crypto exchange

Since there is no established structure for trading in cryptocurrency yet, crypto exchanges are the platforms where people can buy and sell their digital assets. In India, some of the more popular exchanges are WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Step 2: Create an account

After selecting the crypto exchange for trading, create your account on the platform. After creating an account, select the amount you plan to invest, what you seek to invest. Read all policies of the platform carefully. The platform will ask for the submission of documents as proof in order to prevent any fraudulent activities.



Step 3: Set up the account for trading

One needs to have money in the account before buying cryptocurrencies. The money can be transferred from one's bank account to a particular exchange account. Upon transferring funds, make sure that both accounts are linked.

Step 4: Making the investment

After the accounts are linked and the crypto exchange account has money, one needs to select which coin they want to invest in. The world's biggest and most popular cryptocurrency is bitcoin, followed by ethereum by market cap. Other leading coins include tether, dogecoin, XRP, cardano, binance coin. After purchasing, make sure you store codes to the account, to protect it from risks such as hacking. Experts advise storing the coins purchased in a crypto wallet.



Latest prices:



On Saturday, August 21, bitcoin was last trading 3.26 per cent higher at $48,707.8 against the US dollar. Ethereum - the world's second-largest cryptocurrency was last up 1.15 per cent higher at $3,273.60 against the American currency.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/ogfsfjs8_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,CNBC,Inside Afghanistan's cryptocurrency underground as the country plunges into turmoil,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/21/bitcoin-afghanistan-cryptocurrency-taliban-capital-flight.html,"Crypto trader and vlogger Farhan Hotak traveling to the Shah Wali Kot District in Afghanistan.

Farhan Hotak isn't your typical 22 year-old Afghan. In the last week, he helped his family of ten flee the province of Zabul in southern Afghanistan and travel 97 miles to a city on the Pakistani border. But unlike others choosing to leave the country, once his relatives were in safe hands, Hotak then turned around and came back so that he could protect his family home – and vlog to his thousands of Instagram followers about the evolving situation on the ground in Afghanistan. He has also been keeping a very close eye on his crypto portfolio on Binance, as the local currency touches record lows and nationwide bank closures make it next to impossible to withdraw cash. ""In Afghanistan, we don't have platforms like PayPal, Venmo, or Zelle, so I have to depend on other things,"" said Hotak. Afghanistan still mostly operates as a cash economy, so money in Hotak's crypto wallet won't help him put dinner on his table tonight, but it does give him peace of mind that some of his wealth is safeguarded against economic instability at home. It also offers bigger promises down the road: Access to the global economy from inside Afghanistan, certain protections against spiraling inflation, and crucially, the opportunity to make a bet on himself and a future he didn't think was possible before learning about bitcoin. ""I have very, very, very limited resources to do anything. I'm interested in the crypto world, because I have earned a lot, and I see a lot of potential in myself that I can go further,"" he said.

Run on the banks

For many Afghans, this week has laid bare the worst-case scenario for a country running on legacy financial rails: A nationwide cash shortage, closed borders, a plunging currency, and rapidly rising prices of basic goods. Many banks were forced to shutter their doors after running out of cash this week. Photos featuring hundreds of Kabul residents crowding outside branches in a futile effort to draw money from their accounts went viral.

""There's no bank I can go to right now, no ATM,"" said Ali Latifi, a journalist born and based in Kabul. ""I live above two banks and three ATM machines, but they've been off since Thursday,"" said Latifi, referring to the Thursday before the palace ouster. Without an authority helming the Central Bank, it appears that printing cash to cover the shortfall isn't an option, at least in the short-term. The Western Union has suspended all services and even the centuries-old ""hawala"" system – which facilitates cross-border transactions via a sophisticated network of money exchangers and personal contacts – for now, remains closed.

Sangar Paykhar, a Kabul native currently living in the Netherlands, has been in constant touch with relatives there in recent weeks. He said that many who live paycheck to paycheck were, at first, borrowing money from others to get by, but now, those able to lend out cash have started conserving their funds. ""They've realized the regime has collapsed"" and that those they are lending to ""might not have a job tomorrow,"" said Paykhar. A few days before the Taliban entered Kabul, Musa Ramin was among the people who queued outside a bank in a fruitless attempt to withdraw cash. But unlike other Afghans in line with him that day, months earlier, he had invested a portion of his net worth into crypto. Ramin had been burned before by a rapidly depreciating currency, and decentralized digital money had proven to be a trusted safeguard. In 2020, on what was meant to be a brief layover on a trip from London to Kabul, Ramin got stuck in Turkey. A one-week, mandatory Covid quarantine ballooned into six months. ""I converted all my money to the lira,"" he said. After the Turkish currency began to spiral, Ramin said his capital was cut in half, and he was forced to conserve it. ""That is when I discovered bitcoin."" With all flights cancelled and no other options for departure, Ramin realized he needed to find alternative ways to support himself while stranded in Turkey during the pandemic-related shutdown. That's when he started trading crypto. ""At first, I lost a lot of money,"" he said. But he's since gotten the swing of managing his digital assets, thanks to Twitter and tutorials on YouTube.

Even after returning to Kabul, the 27 year-old says he put all his focus into trading crypto. 80% of his crypto capital is in spot exposure, primarily in major coins, like bitcoin, ethereum, and binance coin. The other 20% he uses to trade futures. ""I was making more money in crypto in a month than in construction in a year,"" said Ramin, though he did acknowledge the risk that's involved. ""It's easy making money in crypto but keeping that wealth is the difficult part."" Despite that volatility, Ramin still sees crypto as the safest place to park his cash. ""If a government isn't formed quickly, we might see a Venezuela-type situation here,"" Ramin told CNBC. He feels virtual tokens are his safest hedge against political uncertainty and plans to increase his exposure to digital currencies in the coming year to as much as 40% of his total net worth.

Ramin isn't alone in his thinking. Google trends data shows that web searches in Afghanistan for ""bitcoin"" and ""crypto"" rose sharply in July just before the coup in Kabul. That said, because this tool is a measure of interest, the spike could be referring to 10 searches or it could be 100,000. But in a country that has long relied on physical cash for virtually all transactions, not many people have the option to let their savings sit in a bank account, let alone a digital wallet. Just take Hotak. He lives in a remote part of Afghanistan where there are no ATMs or bank branches nearby. That means he has to keep a lot of physical cash on hand, in order to cover daily expenses. ""Afghanistan is an unexpected country, and you have to be ready for anything,"" he said. While Hotak thinks that crypto is his future, for now, the bulk of his income comes from day labor jobs, like shoveling, brick work, digging wells, and running a tailor shop that makes clothes.



""Zabul is not a very developed city. It's a village, so that's how I earn,"" he said.

Signs of a growing crypto economy

It's hard to get insight into crypto adoption in Afghanistan. Beyond the fact that measuring cryptocurrency adoption at the grassroots level isn't easy, people actively go out of their way to hide who they are. Some Afghans, for example, will conceal their IP address by using a virtual private network, or VPN, in order to mask their geographic digital footprint. And unlike many crypto boosters – who tend to be vocal and community-driven – digital currency supporters inside Afghanistan often don't want others to know they exist. ""The crypto community in Afghanistan is very small,"" said Hotak. ""They actually don't want to meet each other."" He thinks that could change if the political situation normalizes, but ""for now, everyone just wants to stay hidden until things are nice."" However, new research from blockchain data firm Chainalysis is offering fresh optics on the country's apparently burgeoning peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto network, which is increasingly the most telling metric of adoption in Afghanistan. Hotak, as well as his friends, use Binance's P2P exchange, which allows them to buy and sell their coins directly with other users on the platform.

Chainalysis' 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index gives Afghanistan a rank of 20 out of the 154 countries it evaluated in terms of overall crypto adoption. And when you isolate for its P2P exchange trade volume, Afghanistan jumps up to seventh place. That's a big move in just 12 months: Last year, Chainalysis considered Afghanistan's crypto presence to be so minimal as to entirely exclude it from its 2020 ranking. ""Afghanistan on top makes sense from a capital controls point of view, given it's hard to move money in and out,"" explained Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst. And some experts tell CNBC that Chainalysis could actually be underestimating its overall adoption. ""Unlike many other countries, sanctioned nations don't have good and clear data on P2P markets,"" explained Sobrado. He says that is partly to do with the fact that it is harder to track those transactions.

There are other anecdotal signs of adoption across the country. Nearly a decade ago, sisters and Afghan entrepreneurs Elaha and Roya – both of whom had a focus on computer science at Herat University – founded the Digital Citizen Fund, an NGO that helps women and girls in developing countries gain access to technology. The organization has 11 women-only IT centers in Herat and another two in Kabul, where they teach 16,000 females everything from essential computer skills to blockchain technology. Before classes were suspended earlier this week, creating a crypto wallet was also part of the curriculum. Elaha Mahboob tells CNBC that some students have chosen to secure their money in crypto accounts and a few have specifically started investing in bitcoin and ethereum in order to achieve their long-term financial goals. ""This is especially important as they don't have to worry about not having access to their money, because major banks in Afghanistan have closed,"" Mahboob said. A few Digital Citizen Fund participants have left the country and used the crypto accounts they made in class as a way to transfer their money out. Afghanistan's exposure to the cryptosphere was also taking place inside the presidential palace. Blockchain company Fantom told CNBC it had been working in tandem with the previous government. One such project with the Ministry of Health involved piloting blockchain technology to track counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Fantom says the pilot ""concluded successfully,"" and they had been preparing for national rollout before the Taliban took over. Then there's Sweden-based Bitrefill, an online marketplace that helps customers live on cryptocurrency by exchanging digital coins like bitcoin or dogecoin for gift cards with partner merchants. In Afghanistan, the card offerings include multiple mobile phone service providers, games such as Fortnite and Minecraft, Hotels.com, and Flightgift, which can be redeemed for flights with 300 international airlines. While the company wouldn't share sales numbers on the record with CNBC, Bitrefill does have the endorsement of Janey Gak, who uses it to top up her phone. Her Twitter account has become a must-follow for those who want to understand the situation on the ground through her eyes, but she's also evangelizing the power of bitcoin to transform the country. ""I'm just an ordinary person. I'm not anyone special,"" she said. ""I am just someone who discovered bitcoin a couple of years ago."" In 2018, Gak — who goes by the name ""Bibi Janey"" — started a Facebook page as a hobby to see what Afghans thought of bitcoin. ""I remember getting a lot of comments and questions like, 'Can you explain more?'"" she said. ""People would be fascinated by it, but they would be so confused."" She also got lots of questions about where to buy bitcoin. Since entering this world, she has learned how to code and reads as much as she can about bitcoin. ""I don't trade, I don't do any of that,"" she said. ""I just make some money here and there and save it in bitcoin."" Through her research, she's come to the conclusion that in order for Afghanistan to be a truly sovereign state, it must never borrow money – and adopt a bitcoin standard. To foment wider adoption, Gak commissions articles to be translated to local languages. ""It's not much, but it's a start,"" she told CNBC.

DIY crypto rails

The on-ramp to participating in the crypto economy in Afghanistan is complicated and there are still multiple barriers to entry. Access to the internet, while growing, remains low. There were 8.64 million internet users in Afghanistan in January 2021, according to DataReportal.com and internet penetration stood at 22%. Unreliable electricity poses another major issue, as power outages are common. ""Power goes out once every day for a couple of hours,"" said Ramin, though he noted that it happens in some parts of Kabul more often than others. When CNBC first spoke to Hotak, he was seated near one of the land-crossings into Pakistan, tapping into a WiFi network across the border. ""We don't have proper internet on the Afghanistan side,"" he explained. Hotak also uses solar power to charge his phone, given the country's long-standing issue with electricity outages. Electricity and a stable internet connection are two essential rails for widespread crypto adoption. Also critical is having access to some form of online banking or a credit card that is recognized internationally – which again, poses a big problem for many Afghans. Eighty-five percent of the country is unbanked, according to one U.N. estimate, meaning they do not have a bank account. So people wishing to deal in crypto have to get creative. Hotak and some of his contacts enlist the help of family and friends in neighboring Pakistan or across the Gulf of Oman in the United Arab Emirates, where they have easier access to global markets. ""It's very easy in Pakistan,"" he said. ""Most people have relatives in Dubai, who buy crypto for them using their credit cards."" When the person then wants to liquidate their crypto stake, relatives will sell it for them and use the hawala system, an honor-based system of credit common in Asia and the Middle East, to transfer the funds across the border to Afghanistan. The strategy requires a great deal of trust. In the case of Hotak, his friend in Pakistan doubles as his crypto broker. ""He is a very, very close friend. He has his details on the account that I use, so we could say that it's his account, but I use it,"" Hotak said of the arrangement.

Trust is also key when it comes to judging the quality of trading tips. ""There's a lot of scammers on YouTube and Twitter,"" warned Ramin. When he first started off, he would spend most of his money buying coins promoted by people looking for exit liquidity. ""That's why I stopped trading small-cap coins."" Hotak, on the other hand, has found a reliable online community that offers him sound trading advice. ""There's a few groups on Telegram, WhatsApp, and there's even a Pakistani community on Facebook I follow that gives me the signals to sell. I follow them, and it's been good so far,"" said Hotak. Brokers advertising crypto services on Facebook appear to be operating across the country. Hotak visited one in Herat in early 2020. He went to interview for a job there and says the two-story data center was packed with boys, mostly aged 20 to 25. ""They were all university people,"" he said. ""They all had smartphones in their hands, and they were just scrolling down and down."" CNBC has not spoken with any of these brokerages directly, but Hotak says the site he visited in Herat is still going. Hotak also says that Herat is home to a bitcoin mining farm. ""They had these very big CPUs. Very advanced,"" he said. But Hotak tells CNBC he didn't get to see the entire operation. ""I just got a little glimpse of it."" Blockchain analysts Lorne Lantz and Rieya Piscano say they looked at various data sources and found no sign of bitcoin or ethereum nodes running in Afghanistan, so it is unclear whether this miner in Herat has covered his online footprint, or whether he's cut off his rigs. Even with all of these workarounds, the political turmoil of the last few weeks doesn't make it easy to find time to think about crypto. ""The reality is I cannot focus on crypto trading when the ongoing events in Afghanistan are this intense,"" said Hotak. ""With no electricity and bad internet, crypto trading is near to impossible, so we just hold.""

Path to mass adoption

On Aug. 15, an hour and a half before Ramin's flight bound for Turkey was due to take off, then-President Ghani arrived to the airport in Kabul. After that, Ramin says that all flights were halted and everyone was kicked out. Ramin still has plans to leave, along with his family. But finding a flight is proving to be difficult. He's used his now dwindling supply of afghanis to purchase flights for ten members of his family. He's done this three times, and all three times, the flights were canceled. With travel agencies shut, he remains in a bit of a holding pattern on the ground in Kabul. Ramin is one among many looking to leave the country. Every media outlet on the planet has been circulating the same photos of Afghans clinging to planes, fleeing the country with whatever possessions they can carry. For several, this has meant having to leave a lot behind. Ramin estimates that around 5-10% of his net worth is in crypto, which makes it easier to plan an exit, knowing that there is some money in the bank to tide him over, especially since he doesn't know if he will ever see the money in his bank accounts in Kabul. ""If some type of government doesn't come to existence, then I could potentially see the majority of my wealth being wiped out,"" he said. For now, he and his family are just sitting tight, waiting to catch a flight out. But many people are staying put, in part because they want to foment positive change at home. ""In these circumstances, one can fully appreciate the censorship-resistance property of blockchain-based assets. I believe this is the main driver of the fundamental value of bitcoin and other cryptos,"" said Andrea Barbon, Assistant Professor of Finance at the University of St. Gallen. Gak, for example, thinks that using legacy financial rails like the hawala system might be one of the most effective ways to foster mass adoption. It is a vision she detailed in a prescient story she wrote for Hacker Noon in 2018. She's also thinking about opening her own exchange shop in Kabul. ""The idea is that anyone with bitcoin can exchange it for fiat and then use that to buy goods like always. Anyone who is unable to receive can have their family for example, send the bitcoin to me with a unique address that only the recipient would know just like hawala,"" she explained in a tweet. Ramin has a similar plan to make crypto more accessible to Afghans. ""I hope once I gain more knowledge in blockchain technology to create a team and develop an easily accessible trading platform which Afghans can use,"" he said. There are promising trends on their side. The number of social media users in Afghanistan increased by 22% from 2020 to 2021, and 68.7% of the total population now has a mobile phone connection, according to DataReportal.com. It helps that more than 60% of the population is under 25 and hungry to be a part of the modern economy. Shakib Noori, previously the CEO of a mobile money company in Afghanistan, says this younger demographic also tends to be more tech savvy. Ultimately, CNBC is told that grassroots adoption comes down to one Afghan teaching another about how cryptocurrencies like bitcoin work. Hotak has already mentored three students, and that's just the beginning. ""The Afghan people – they're very complicated. And it's very hard convincing them that digital currency exists,"" he said. ""I have plans to teach people about cryptocurrency in the future...but for now, people are just laying low and waiting to see what happens next.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929612-1629282287651-Screen_Shot_2021-08-18_at_32313_AM.png?v=1629282536',)",none

After a long discussion by the Indian Government over cryptocurrencies in the country, finally a cryptocurrency bill is tabled before the Union Cabinet and everyone is waiting for approval. The bill attempts to regulate virtual currency in India. Presently cryptocurrencies in India are not under any regulation, this makes an unofficial area for Indian investors.

On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the cabinet note was ready on the cryptocurrency bill. She was awaiting Cabinet to clear that, she added.

Under the chairmanship of the Secretary (Economic Affairs), a high-level inter-ministerial panel was formed to explore the issues related to cryptocurrencies and propose specific actions that have already submitted its report. The report advocates that all private cryptocurrencies except the digital currencies that are issued by the state will be forbidden in India.

In the meantime, the RBI discusses the cryptocurrencies traded in the market and has conveyed the same to the government.

Back in May this year, the finance minister conveyed that a very calibrated position is supposed to be taken on crypto and virtual currency as the world is promptly transforming towards technology. Other media reports indicated that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be permitted as an asset class in India.

Highlighting the fact that both the government and the RBI are dedicated to financial strength and solidity, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said there are no differences between the central bank and the Finance Ministry on the matter, and that all should now await the final decision on the matter from the Centre.

Major concerns regarding cryptocurrencies have been identified by the RBI and that the government is in agreement with those concerns, said Mr. Das.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to control the production of its units and validate the transfer of funds, working independently of a central bank.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said, a three-judge bench, led by Justice R F Nariman, is responsible to be set apart on the ground of “proportionality”.

“Therefore, the writ appeals are enabled and the circular dated April 6, 2018, is set apart,” said the bench, which is also involving justices Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency-Bill-What-Will-Be-Indias-Stand-on-Digital-Assets.jpg',)",none
2021-08-26,Gadgets 360,Cardano (ADA) Price Hits All-Time High Ahead of 'Alonzo' Upgrade,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cardano-ada-price-in-india-all-time-high-cryptocurrency-coin-alonzo-upgrade-founder-charles-hoskinson-2515498,"Cardano (ADA) price has jumped more than 50 percent over the last 10 days to occupy the third spot among the world's top cryptocurrencies with an $80 billion (Rs. 5,94,400 crores) market cap, ahead of the popular Binance Coin. During the wild ride, it touched its lifetime high of $2.58 (Rs. 191.70) but the gains had tapered off a bit by Saturday morning. The rally is being attributed to a coming “Alonzo” upgrade that will allow smart-contract functionality and a range of decentralised finance (DeFi) applications to run on the Cardano network. The proposed technological enhancement is likely to land as soon as next month.

Co-founded by Charles Hoskinson, a mathematician and former CEO of Ethereum, the Cardano network is being touted as a serious rival to the Ethereum blockchain, which currently dominates the DeFi services market. The ADA coin has jumped from $1.70 (Rs 126) on August 10 to $2.58 on August 20, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing this report, the Cardano (ADA) price in India was around Rs. 190.

The lack of smart-contract functions has been widely seen as Cardano's biggest drawback and their availability is Ethereum's biggest strength. These contracts are a way to ensure agreements can be validated securely.

Earlier this month, the development team behind the Alonzo upgrade announced the launch of the public test net, saying it was an “exciting and important next step” in the Cardano journey.

This is an exciting and important next step in the #Alonzo journey. In fact, the #Cardano journey. With the support of our OG community testers on the Blue & White phases, #AlonzoPurple will be the first fully public Cardano testnet to support #smartcontracts ????

2/12 — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) August 6, 2021

Despite the rally and even before it over the possibility of the coming upgrade, some people have shown skepticism about the success of the Cardano coin. This had prompted Hoskinson to respond to the naysayers in a tweet earlier this month, promising to start a fund to pay for the therapy of the critics.

It's extraordinary to me the level of skepticism about our upcoming smart contract launch. It's not something like SCs will be underwhelming, but rather it simply won't happen. The critics say it with biblical level certainty. We should start a fund to pay for their therapy — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 4, 2021

Meanwhile, the recent rallies in Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano (ADA), and others have helped the cryptocurrency market to surpass the $2 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,48,50,910 crores) market-cap milestone for the first time since May, when a market crash had routed the volatile trade.

2021-08-26,News18,Bitcoin Maximalists Think Cryptocurrency Could Have Stopped Afghanistan's Takeover. Here's How,https://www.news18.com/news/india/bitcoin-maximalists-think-cryptocurrency-could-have-stopped-afghanistans-takeover-by-taliban-heres-how-4110659.html,"Bitcoin maximalists have been opining that cryptocurrency will and could have been the fix for Afghanistan against Taliban. Some said that war financing could have stopped had crypto been the norm while others empathisized with Afghans worried about their savings as Taliban took over banks.

News18 explains what the maximalists had to say as part of their argument:

How could Bitcoin come to the rescue?

Dr. Josh Cotton, a Bitcoin advocate and founder of MilitaryToken, said in a tweet that “an enormous amount of cash just fell into the hands of the Taliban because cash can’t be truly secured,” adding of course, “Bitcoin fixes this.”

He was hinting towards the enormously secure blockchain technology used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that do not let access to any other individual.

A report by Vice quoted Jimmy Song, one of Bitcoin’s most ardent public advocates saying, “Bitcoin would have prevented the war in Afghanistan had it been the global reserve currency instead of the greenback. No sane government would have spent explicitly taxed dollars on a war that cost that much and lasted that long.”

“The only reason the US could was because of the dollar’s privileged position as the global reserve currency which allowed stealth taxation of the entire world through inflation.”

What is debasement and how are Bitcoiners assuring countries don’t finance war?

Debasement was practiced in the 16th century by England’s King Henry VIII to help fund wars with France and Scotland. The king replaced precious metal content of coins like gold with cheaper metals like copper, reducing the costs of currency production at the expense of taxpayers. Roman emperor Nero used to employ a similar trickery, cutting down on the silver content in the currency. By some estimates, debasement led to annual inflation of around 1,000 percent at one point in Roman history.

Some countries do something similar today, say the proponents of the debasement theory. The government prints more money than it can back up with underlying assets so that it can fund foreign wars, which comes at the expense of citizens in the form of taxes, according to public statements made by various supporters of the theory.

“Bitcoin doesn’t let governments do this crazy deficit spending as they are forced to get loans on the market to do so,” said Jimmy Song.

The idea of inflation as stealth taxation, and its connection with war financing, is one that’s commonly shared by Bitcoin maxis with a libertarian streak

What about Taliban taking over banks and people worrying about savings?

Afghans have been crowding banks trying to access their savings, but mostly in vain.

Not only would Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies make it difficult to confiscate wealth and to keep it safe but the whole situation could have been avoided had the world adopted decentralized money.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be stored on tiny USB thumb drive-sized hardware wallets or on online wallets. A user only needs to remember the corresponding passphrase or key to having access to funds.

2021-08-26,Gadgets 360,What Is a Blockchain Node and How Is It Used in Cryptocurrency?,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/what-is-a-blockchain-node-how-does-cryptocurrency-work-2515427,"A Node is a part of cryptocurrency that is needed to make most of the popular tokens like Bitcoin or Dogecoin function. It's a fundamental part of the blockchain network, which is the decentralised ledger that is used to maintain a cryptocurrency.

The involvement of a greater number of people in the cryptocurrency market is pushing the desire in them to learn how the system works. This is true for any sector but the newness of cryptocurrency is also leading to curiosity. While you don't really need to understand how blockchain works to be able to benefit from a rise in the price of Bitcoin in India, having a basic understandig of the terms that are thrown around can be useful.

One term you may have heard, but don't know the meaning of, is 'node'. The term is not exclusive to the only cryptocurrency and is widely used outside it. However, a node, in the world of virtual coins, is a computer connected to a cryptocurrency network and can execute certain functions like creating, receiving or sending information.

The explanation can vary depending on the protocol. For example, a resident network may comprise a file server, three laptops and a fax machine. In this case, the network has five nodes, each equipped with a unique MAC address to identify them.

What is a node in blockchain?

The term “node” is being used mostly in relation to blockchain, a decentralised digital ledger that records all cryptocurrency transactions and makes the information available to everyone via a connected device. What this means is every transaction has to be chronologically recorded and distributed to a series of connected devices. These devices are called nodes. These nodes communicate with each other within the network and transfer information about transactions and new blocks.

It is a critical component of the blockchain infrastructure. It helps maintain the security and integrity of the network. A blockchain node's main purpose is to verify each batch of network transactions, called blocks. Each node is distinguished from others by a unique identifier.

What are the types of nodes?

There are basically two types of nodes: full nodes and lightweight nodes.

Full nodes support and provide security to the network. These nodes download a blockchain's entire history to observe and enforce its rules.

Each user in the network is a lightweight node. The lightweight node has to connect to a full node to be able to participate.

Many volunteers run full Bitcoin nodes in a bid to help the Bitcoin ecosystem. As of now, there are roughly 12,130 public nodes running on the Bitcoin network. Other than the public nodes, there are many hidden nodes (non-listening nodes). These nodes usually run behind a firewall.

Miners' nodes

There is also a third type of node: Miner nodes. The term “Bitcoin miners” has now become familiar. These miners are classified as nodes. miner may work alone (solo miner) or in groups (pool miner). A solo miner uses his own full node. In a mining pool, only the administrator can run a full node — which can be referred to as a pool miner's full node.

Listening nodes (supernodes)

And finally, a sub-category called listening nodes. A listening node, essentially, is a publicly visible full node. It communicates with any node that decides to establish a connection with it. A reliable super node typically runs all the time, transmitting blockchain history and transaction data to multiple nodes.","('https://cdn.ndtv.com/tech/images/blockchain_removed_apple_app_store.jpg',)",none
2021-08-19,Analytics Insight,Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in This Weekend,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-cryptocurrencies-to-invest-in-this-weekend-august-edition/,"Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in This Weekend – August Edition

These cryptocurrencies are showing strong potential in the market.

Cryptocurrencies are growing to become stronger investment options as months go by. Keeping an eye on the crypto trends, a lot of new and seasoned investors are gearing up to make crypto investments. For that, Analytics Insight has made this of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this weekend.

1. Bitcoin

After the crypto market crash in the first half of 2021, experts were anticipating Bitcoin’s rise. After falling from grace, from US$60,000 to US$30,000, Bitcoin has finally crossed the US$45,000 mark. This marks Bitcoin’s potential to give good returns to investors who are looking to make long-term profits.

2. Ethereum

Next to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency. Its blockchain network transformed the DeFi sector and made way for decentralized apps. Recently, Ethereum launched its much-awaited new update that will improve the transaction fees and reduce Ether’s inflation. This change makes it easy for investors to understand the value of investing in Ether and give miners a fair fee.

3. XRP

XRP is purely a utility token created by Ripple. XRP’s blockchain platform aims to set up cross-border currencies without any hindrance. Since its launch, many banks have realized the capabilities of this token and the volume of transactions on this network has increased since then. One of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to buy, XRP has a bright future in the crypto market.

4. Tether

Tether is unlike most cryptocurrencies in the market as it is a stable coin. A stable coin is a digital token that has a fixed value and is pegged to a fiat currency, like the Euro or the Dollar. Similarly, Tether has a fixed value of US$1 or equivalent and maintains US$1 in reserve for each Tether issued.

5. USD Coin

USD Coin is a more popular stable coin as its value is strictly pegged to the US dollar. Stable coins withstand market volatility better and offer a more risk-free investment option.

6. Cardano

Cardano is known for its proof-of-stake network. Its open blockchain platform is open-source and decentralized. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its native token, Ada. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies to invest in.

7. Dogecoin

Dogecoin needs no introduction. It has made enough headlines, thanks to Elon Musk’s obsession with making cryptocurrencies trending. What once started as a joke has now become a legitimate investment option with its value that grew more than 50% since its inception. It’s also one of the cheapest cryptocurrencies to invest in.

8. Binance Coin

Binance Coin is a token native to the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. As long as there is activity on the Binance exchange, Binance coin will continue to steadily grow. Ranked among the top six cryptocurrencies in the world, Binance coin can be used to trade other cryptocurrencies as well.

9. Litecoin

Litecoin is a rival for Bitcoin’s blockchain network. Litecoin aims to pay for everyday goods and services with transactions faster than Bitcoin. Litecoin has been recognized for its practical purpose by market experts and trade merchants. This means Litecoin is a crypto that can suddenly take on a bull run.

10. NEO

Similar to Ethereum, NEO is a platform for smart contracts. Launched in 2014, NEO’s mission is to improve Ethereum’s network by offering the same utility functions via a more sophisticated blockchain. While NEOs network is superior to Ethereum, it will only reach its full potential in a couple of years. The wait will be worth it for investors.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Top-Cryptocurrencies-to-Invest-In-This-Weekend.jpg',)",none
2021-08-19,Markets Insider,Cardano surges 25% in 2 days to become 3rd-largest cryptocurrency as new protocol upgrade looms,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/cardano-price-crypto-ethereum-binance-alonzo-protocol-upgrade-market-cap-2021-08,"Cardano ada SOPA images

Cardano jumped 25% in a two-day surge that catapulted it to the third-biggest cryptocurrency.

The surge was fueled by a looming protocol upgrade to cardano called Alonzo that would bring full-functionality smart contracts to the blockchain.

Cardano's last major leap - just last week - was also driven by Alonzo upgrade news.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Cardano jumped 25% in a two-day surge that catapulted the ethereum competitor to the third-biggest cryptocurrency, edging out Binance coin but still short of ether.

Cardano's ada token leaped to as high as $2.58 on Friday from a Wednesday closing price of $2.05. The token, launched in 2017, has seen startling growth in 2021, exploding 1367% in price this year.

The surge was fueled by a looming protocol upgrade to cardano called Alonzo that would bring full-functionality smart contracts to the blockchain, in a clear challenge to ethereum. The upgrade is set for early October, though some market participants are skeptical of that launch date, according to CoinDesk. The upgrade was previously bumped from September to October.

The higher price made Cardano's ada the third-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap at more than $80 billion, ahead of Binance coin at $69 billion. However, it still has a ways to go before displacing ethereum, worth some $380 billion.

Cardano's last major leap - just last week - was also driven by Alonzo upgrade news. Investors ""were hyped on the optimism that a supposedly superior blockchain infrastructure with the possibility to support the next generation of smart contracts is on the horizon,"" executive director of crypto exchange CEX.IO Konstantin Anissimov told Insider at the time.

Cardano's price action comes as interest grows in exploring ethereum alternatives. Users have long complained that ethereum's high ""gas"" fees limit the cryptocurrency's reach, a problem that the recent EIP-1559 protocol upgrade is trying to address.

Cardano was trading at $2.54 as of 12:05 p.m. ET, up 19.4% in the last 24 hours.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/611fd4731c47770019e69bd3?format=jpeg',)",none
2021-08-19,The Motley Fool,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are All Soaring Today",https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/20/why-bitcoin-ethereum-and-dogecoin-are-all-soaring/,"What happened

Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) are up 6.82%, 8.16%, and 8.36% in the past 24 hours. As of 10:30 a.m. EDT, they are now trading at $48,518.76 per coin, $3,293.94 per token, and $0.3319 apiece, respectively.

Earlier in the day, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN), the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, announced it would be adding $500 million worth of cryptocurrency to its balance sheet. The move sent the whole sector into a monstrous rally. Coinbase stock is also up 3.10% to $255.98 per share in the same period.

So what

It's not just Coinbase's big move that investors are happy about. On Aug. 19, the second-largest mortgage lender in the U.S., UWM Holdings, announced it would start accepting Bitcoin for home loans. The adoption could take effect by the end of the third quarter, and the company is also considering adding other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum into the mix.

Speaking of Ethereum, it was revealed on the same day that the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract had become the largest holder of Ether -- at $21.3 billion. The news illustrates growing confidence in the Ethereum Foundation's transition to its 2.0 network. By the end of 2022, Ethereum will run a proof-of-stake protocol, which its development team estimates will cut its energy use by 99% -- essentially wiping out concerns about its environmental sustainability.

As for Dogecoin, the once-meme digital currency is growing in recognition. During popular discount brokerage Robinhood Markets' earnings release on Aug. 18, the company disclosed that Dogecoin accounted for 62% of cryptocurrency revenue in the second quarter. The same day, Ethereum's founder Vitalik Buterin announced he would be joining the development team behind Dogecoin as a board member.

Now what

Dogecoin is leaving behind its reputation as a joke cryptocurrency. Since the beginning of the year, the number of merchants accepting Doge as payment has grown by 34.7% to 1,616. In addition, the network has found its unique niche due to its slight inflationary nature. Dogecoin miners do not face the threat of their high-tech GPU mining rigs becoming redundant with the rise of PoS protocols. At the same time, the mining isn't so difficult as to induce heavy electricity use.

Bitcoin's slow, archaic, and environmentally unfriendly protocol is finally getting an overhaul, too. In a rare act of solidarity, miners worldwide reached the consensus for Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade, which will allow smart contract adoption on its network and is scheduled to take effect in November. Bitcoin has no central development team, so it's up to a unanimous vote from miners to upgrade the world's biggest cryptocurrency. The last one happened four years ago.

Overall, investors' fear, uncertainty, and doubt -- known in the cryptocurrency world as FUD -- regarding the sector in Q2 are melting away very quickly as new innovations are beginning to address these issues. It's looking like the start of the next bull run for the cryptocurrency sector.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640139/gettyimages-1171929176.jpg',)",none
2021-08-19,The Economic Times,Future of Cryptos in India: A blanket ban or birth of a new age asset class?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/future-of-cryptos-in-india-a-blanket-ban-or-the-new-age-asset-class/articleshow/85489406.cms,"NEW DELHI: The cryptocurrency bill is before the Union Cabinet and it is likely to take a decision soon, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said.The proposed legisation on digital currencies was to be presented in Parliament during the monsoon session but that did not happen, said sources.The bill has reportedly recommended that all private cryptocurrencies, except virtual currencies issued by state, be prohibited in India. However, crypto experts say they are hoping for the best.Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of crypto trading platform Mudrex , says, ""We could expect an accommodative and progressive stance by the government towards cryptocurrencies. The government is expected to evaluate all possible aspects. All these events transpire to positive expectations from the cryptocurrency bill.""An inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency, under the secretary (economic affairs), had studies issues around virtual currencies and proposed specific actions in its report.Looking at the growing opportunities in this space, Siddharth Menon, COO of cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, says calibrated regulations that encourage the industry and safeguard consumers will help the ecosystem grow. ""We don't know the details but we expect it to be positive. Once we have more details, we will comment. Else it will be purely speculative,"" Menon adds.Some experts say India cannot be as a laggard when the world is rapidly moving ahead with blockchain technology. This has led to reports that crypto as an asset class might be allowed in India but the government will not accept it as legal tender as yet.Crypto enthusiasts are betting on analyst views that say there might not be a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies. Menon is among those who does not think a blanket ban is possible. The government has understood crypto assets are not a threat to national currency. ""Also, this is a new and growing global fintech industry. India cannot stay behind,"" he adds.Nobody is yet certain about the government's stance in the bill, says Patel, but adds: ""Legislation without a blanket ban would undoubtedly boost the crypto ecosystem in India.""Experts say there is a healthy startup ecosystem that has sprawled up around digital currencies. India has about 15 million people trading in cryptos , said a Bloomberg report in June.Sharan Nair, Chief Business Officer at crypto exchange platform CoinSwitch Kuber, says, investors should not panic. ""The government would ensure that investor interest is protected at all cost.""In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had advised all entities regulated by it to not deal in digital currencies. In 2020, the Supreme Court set aside the central bank’s 2018 circular and allowed banks and financial institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrencies. In May 2021, the RBI permitted banks to facilitate cryptos. ""There are no differences between the central bank and the finance ministry,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said.Negative news from the government will have impact just like it did in 2018, when most of the entrepreneurs either stopped working in this space or left the country, says Menon. ""After the RBI lifted the ban, we have seen a lot more interest among entrepreneurs and tech talent to enter this space. More crypto projects have been born since then,"" he adds.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85489438,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-271455,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-19,KSDK,"Bitcoin for everyone: Missouri mayor wants to give each resident $1,000 in cryptocurrency",https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/investigations/missouri-mayor-wants-to-give-residents-1000-bitcoin/63-a329a9ad-fb82-42a5-a835-8d08e47d428b,"Cool Valley Mayor Jayson Stewart is raising funds to give each resident up to $1000 in Bitcoin. The only catch? They can't sell it

COOL VALLEY, Mo. — A tiny Missouri town could become the first in the country to put Bitcoin in the hands of every resident.

Jayson Stewart, the Mayor of Cool Valley says he is raising funds to give each of the town’s roughly 1500 inhabitants a piece of the digital currency.

Many experts expect Bitcoin to grow in value exponentially in the next decade.

“My daughter says she thinks it's the next big thing. The digital currency,” said Ramona Nickels, a mail carrier who lives in Cool Valley.

“Look, it's digital gold,” said Mayor Stewart. “I would like to see every single household in my city receive some level of Bitcoin, whether it be $500 or $1,000.”

So what is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is one of many cryptocurrencies available today.

It is considered the most well-known cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has been around since 2008.

Think of Bitcoin like regular money. Except it's not issued by any country or impacted by traditional inflation.

You don't need a bank to use, store or transfer Bitcoin. It's completely online. Some economists believe if Bitcoin’s value keeps increasing at its current rate, it could one day become the world's currency.

Recently, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin it's legal tender. It was a move made to protect the country’s economy from rapidly rising inflation.

In Cool Valley, Stewart thinks holding the digital currency could be transformational.

“I have friends whose lives have been completely changed, like going from working a regular nine to five job to being worth over 80 million dollars in a matter of a few years,” said Stewart, who calls himself an Entrepreneur and Environmentalist.

Stewart said most of the money to fund the plan will come from several unnamed Bitcoin investors.

“I have some very supportive donors who have agreed to match any money that I raise up to several millions of dollars,” said Stewart. “I'm trying to get a few government funds as well to go along with that. Or potentially some of the relief money that comes in from the Covid relief.""

But Stewart isn’t ruling out using city funds, saying “It's possible. We'll see how it goes. We'll see how it goes.”

Save it, don’t sell it

Stewart says the Bitcoin will come with some strings attached. He doesn’t want residents to sell for a few years.

“We're putting in place like a vesting schedule for Bitcoin. The idea is that maybe you don't touch it for five years before you really get full access to it. We're working on ideas like that because that's my number one concern. Someone just sells their bitcoin to pay their car note. And then when Bitcoin is sitting at like $500,000 all these years later, they're going to really regret that,” said Stewart.



Roughly 1500 people live in Cool Valley. The dozen or so the I-Team spoke with seemed receptive to the plan.

“With cash people have bad habits and they buy things they shouldn't be buying. But with Bitcoin, maybe you can give it to your kids. My daughter is going to college next year. I could give [the Bitcoin] to her,” said Nickels.

“Putting money in my pocket! Sounds pretty good to me,” said Cornelius Webb, who lives in Cool Valley.

“I believe that Cool Valley is going to get wealthier and wealthier , not just our city, but the actual people who live here,” said Stewart.

Stewart said the city is also going to take proactive measures to off set the environmental impact Bitcoin mining is known to have.

“We're giving away Bitcoin and at the same time we're converting our entire city to solar, like all of the government lights and things like that,” said Stewart.

Details about how Bitcoin will be distributed are still unclear.

Stewart said it will involve door knocking and offering free classes to residents about how to use and securely store Bitcoin. He hopes to kick things off by the end of the year.","('https://media.ksdk.com/assets/KSDK/images/0bd7cda4-f1df-46f7-8b22-392dfe1e8477/0bd7cda4-f1df-46f7-8b22-392dfe1e8477_1140x641.jpg',)",none

Coinbase will buy $500 million in crypto on its balance sheet and allocate 10% of its quarterly profits into a crypto assets portfolio, company executives announced late Thursday.

The company plans to invest in ""Ethereum, Proof of Stake assets, DeFi tokens, and many other crypto assets supported for trading on our platform,"" becoming the first public company to do so, finance chief Alesia Haas said in a blog post.

CEO Brian Armstrong first revealed the brokerage's plans in an earlier tweet, saying he expects the allocation to grow as the market matures. He also indicated the company's ambitions to diversify its crypto services and operations, which mostly center around trading.

""Hopefully over time we can operate more of our business in crypto,"" Armstrong said on Twitter. ""Today it is still a mix.""

The price of bitcoin climbed higher on the news, passing $47,000 on Friday after sitting below $45,000 the previous two days. Coinbase shares rose more than 3% higher in early trading Friday.

The few companies that have included bitcoin in their holdings, like Microstrategy and Tesla (with the help of Coinbase), have done so as a hedge against inflation and potential devaluation of the U.S. dollar. On Thursday, Citi placed Microstrategy's rating under review, suspending its price target and estimates due to its investment in bitcoin and correlation to the digital currency's price.

The news comes a week after Palantir reported quarterly results showing it bought $50 million in physical gold to reportedly hedge against black swan events. Palantir also said it's accepting customer payments in bitcoin, but that none have used the option.

That same week, Coinbase reported quarterly earnings and growth metrics that wowed analysts, who are mostly patient about the stock's correlation to bitcoin's price and volatility and optimistic about its plans to drive long-term innovation throughout the financial system.

Haas said the investments will be driven by its custodial crypto balances and deployed ""over a multi-year window using a dollar cost averaging strategy."" She added that Coinbase is investing for the long term and ""will only divest under select circumstances, such as an asset delisting from our platform.""

Oppenheimer's Owen Lau said he doesn't expect the new investment policy to lower the correlation between Coinbase and bitcoin ""materially in the near future."" However, he said he sees it as a signal that Coinbase can ""further facilitate and influence both retail and institutional adoption"" over time by integrating cryptocurrencies into its own operations, like paying vendors and employees, for example.

The news follows a Wall Street Journal report this week that Coinbase has stockpiled $4 billion in cash to weather regulatory headwinds. Lau noted the company still has plenty of cash on hand despite the transaction.

""Share repurchases and dividends appear to be off the table at least near term, but we believe management will use excess capital to reinvest in the business and make acquisitions, especially in international presence and subscription-based business,"" he added.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106868176-1618411319630-106868176-16184112292021-04-14t143834z_1561353557_rc2qvm91n6cr_rtrmadp_0_coinbase-ipo.jpg?v=1618411334',)",none

It is now the third most valuable cryptocurrency .

. The rally in the crypto asset's value is being attributed to an update that will extend the smart contracting mechanism to the blockchain.

It’s often called “ethereum killer” because of its potential of taking on the mightier crypto with an improved smart contracting system.

The new update will open Cardano to the world of DeFi, NFT, and other automated transaction systems.

Cardano has hit a new all-time high, rising over 20% in the last 24 hours, with its price peaking at $2.55. The cryptocurrency that is powering Charles Hoskinson’s public blockchain has regained the spot of being the third-largest crypto with a whopping $80 billion market cap.The Cardano blockchain's cryptocurrency is called ADA, and the system is often touted to be a direct Ethereum and Solana competitor. It has surpassedCoin and is now the third most valuable crypto after Bitcoin and Ethereum.The rally in the crypto asset's value is attributed to the Alonzo Purple public test net launch. It's the final test phase of the project, which will end in the network finally getting smart contracts capability.The entire crypto market has witnessed a bullish rally in the previous week, pushing its market cap to more than $2 trillion. While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to lead the race, new altcoins are constantly challenging the norm. The price dips from the last two months have not seemed to affect the digital asset's price too much, as it's now back well over $2. It reached an all-time high previously in May, remaining just a little shy of $2.5.The upcoming ‘Alonzo’ upgrade is driving the bullish sentiment. The development team announced the launch of the public test net on Twitter. Incorporating smart contracts is critical for the blockchain as it introduces a range of new capabilities such as DeFi (decentralised finance), NFT (non-fungible token), automated lending, and more.The new update is likely to land on September 12, and investors are confident that it'll be a game-changer. Often called the ""ethereum killer,"" it's four times the size of Solana in terms of market cap but has little practical use-case right now.On the flip side, Japanese authorities have permitted it to float on exchanges in the country. While crypto regulations worldwide are at a nascent stage, Japan's decision is also cited as an indirect mark of due diligence and compliance.Smart or blockchain contracts are unique in the way that they ensure compliance between the two parties. Immutability is one of the most remarkable features of a self-executing contract. It means it is impossible to reverse, alter, or tamper the codes, rules, and even the transactions once programmed on the blockchain.Like traditional contracts, smart contracts are agreements between two or more parties, avoiding the need for vigilance or enforcement from third parties.It's self-executing and impossible to reverse, alter, or tamper with the code, internal regulations, and transactions. The blockchain network maintains a transparent, secure, and immutable transaction ledger that ensures proof of ownership is also established and transferable. Contract negotiation and application become far more accessible, and all the edit history of the transaction is also transparently available.Furthermore, it can also be deployed for DAOs (decentralised autonomous organisations), which require communities to be bound to specific rules coded into blockchain contracts combined with governance mechanisms.Ethereum is infamous for its smart contracting ability and was created by Vitalik Buterin and four other co-founders in 2013. Polkadot, EOS, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and many others still compete for the throne, but none of them can defeat the industry's first mover.

Asian countries are outpacing the rest of the globe in terms of cryptocurrency adoption. According to a recent analysis from market research firm Finder, the top five nations in terms of bitcoin ownership are all located in Asia. Most of them were considered unimportant in the cryptocurrency industry; however, a recent study contradicts the same.The Asian country with the highest percentage of cryptocurrency ownership was Vietnam, at 40 per cent, followed by Indonesia, India , Malaysia, and the Philippines, respectively. 30 per cent of individuals polled in Indonesia and India stated that they held cryptocurrency.According to media reports, India also ranked #2 in a poll of nations that use cryptocurrency the most, with 9% of the respondents claiming they used crypto. Meanwhile, the United States and the United Kingdom had the lowest proportion of cryptocurrency owners, with 8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.After the Supreme court ruled out the RBI ban on crypto transactions, there has been a massive increase in retail investors. CoinSwitch Kuber , the largest cryptocurrency platform in India, has onboarded nearly 8 Million users since June 2020.One trend that has been consistent around the globe is that younger people are leading the charge when it comes to cryptocurrency adoption. Young people between the ages of 18 and 34 make for more than 40% of users throughout the world, according to Finders One of the main reasons behind this is the growth of crypto-based companies such as CoinSwitch Kuber, making crypto investing easy and accessible to individuals.The user base also consisted primarily of those aged 35 to 44, with 17 per cent belonging to those in their 45 to 54-year-old. Also, in nations such as Colombia and Netherlands, crypto adoption is seen majorly among the elderly ie, those above the age of 65.Smaller towns in India have been at the forefront of cryptocurrency acceptance in recent years. The increase in user subscriptions from Tier II and Tier III locations on the CoinSwitch Kuber app have grown by over 2000%.Studies show that the adoption of the crypto market has grown by over 880% between June 2020 - June 2021 worldwide and the number of crypto users in India has crossed over 15 million during this time.Recently, there has been a flurry of activity in India’s cryptocurrency space, with the government working towards acting on laws and investors pouring money into crypto companies. Recently, CoinSwitch Kuber raised $25 million in their Series B round from a VC giant named Tiger Global at a $500 million valuation.According to a poll conducted by global consultancy company PwC, India can be among the leaders in the adoption of the overlying blockchain technology that crypto is based on, over the next five years, if an appropriate degree of business and government engagement is achieved.Sharan Nair, the CBO of CoinSwitch Kuber , stated that “The cryptocurrency industry is steaming hot. 2021 has seen an accelerated interest in the crypto space as companies look to gain exposure to the market. Several sectors floundered in FY21, given the challenges of doing business in a pandemic environment. Fintech, for the most part, was not one of them.”Around 15 million Indians are believed to have made investments in private cryptocurrency holdings. Cryptocurrency investments in the nation increased from $923 million in April 2020 to almost $6.6 billion by May 2021, a growth of about 400% in only one year.Following the announcement of a carefully calibrated position on cryptocurrency and digital money earlier in May, the Finance Ministry stated that the world is evolving quickly with technological advances. The possibility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming recognised as an asset class in India has also been floated recently.On the other hand, the central government has stated that Bitcoin or crypto would not be accepted as legal tender shortly.But there is some good news for the crypto community: the government has stated that it would “investigate the application of crypto’s blockchain technology actively to usher in the digital economy.” Instead of outright outlawing cryptocurrencies, the Indian government may impose stringent rules and regulations in their place.For now, the response to crypto in India has been overwhelmingly positive. It is clear that cryptocurrency does have a market in the country, and it is growing exponentially.The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.

How did it all begin?

NEW DELHI: The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) - the central bank of China - has heeded the advisory sent by its Shenzhen branch to show zero tolerance to cryptocurrencies.Following the advisory, PBOC has taken ‘cleansing’ operations of 11 companies that used to deal with cryptocurrencies in the Shenzhen region, according to a report in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that quoted the state-run Shanghai Securities News.However, the authorities have not divulged finer details of how the issue was dealt with.Shenzhen is a global resource centre for computer hardware that includes cryptocurrency mining equipment.In recent times, this region developed into one of the key bases for China’s digital token investment community, the report adds.As a global economy, China had sensed danger from crypto to its economy and money market following traders going overboard with their passion for the digital currency.The authorities had apprehensions that if allowed to grow, cryptocurrency would be a threat to the financial stability of the country. They had targeted Bitcoin and other digital tokens.In February 2021, Shenzhen shut down eight companies for their alleged activities in digital tokens. The Shenzhen branch of PBOC had cracked down on cross-border trading in foreign currencies and stocks which included cryptocurrencies.The Chinese do not distinguish between foreign currency and cryptocurrency. Both are equal in terms of the damage they cause to their economy. But the Chinese financial experts were okay with foreign exchange earned by trading legal currencies.Shenzhen’s move against cryptocurrency shows the mood of the Chinese administration. It became more evident in the last few months after the State Council’s Financial Stability and Development Committee, chaired by Vice-Premier Liu He, announced a further crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading.Two major operators in China – Huobi, and OKCoin cancelled the business license registration of their respective subsidiaries in Beijing.BTCChina, which once ran the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange is quoted in the report saying that it had “completely exited from bitcoin-related businesses” on the mainland.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85484786,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Buying crypto coins vs buying shares/bonds:

Trading platforms:

Profit controlling factors:

Volatility and market:

Decentralised vs centralised trading:

NEW DELHI: Ever since the advent of cryptocurrency in 2009 in the trading world, it has grown in popularity at an alarming pace.While cryptocurrency continues to intrigue investors, many people often confuse the crypto market with the stock exchange.Here's listing some of the basic differences between the two.In the stock exchange, shares can be bought and traded in two ways.First, the shares and bonds are listed and sold by companies for the first time in the primary market. Then in the secondary market, those shares and bonds are traded with other investors on stock exchange platforms like BSE or NASDAQ. The prospects of returns and risks are determined by the investment method opted by the investor.In cryptocurrency, trading is done by buying and selling of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum with INR, dollars, pound etc. A crypto asset is firstly bought with local currency and crypto investors directly start exploring and trading for earning profits.The stock exchange market of India has 8 established exchange platforms. Among these, NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) account for maximum trading in the country. In case of cryptocurrency, there are online trading platforms like ZebPay that are rapidly growing and gaining a foothold in India’s nascent crypto market.Both stock exchange and crypto markets are controlled by demand and supply factors created by sellers and buyers. The stock market is additionally affected by a host of factors like political events, natural disasters, sporting events etc. This is due to the interdependence of the banking system and government regulations that regulate the stock market.Crypto exchange is an excitingly lucrative trading option, fraught with risks owing to its budding market. This makes crypto extremely volatile and consequently a source of quick and high returns. In comparison, the stock market is a highly stable, established, and diverse trade market where investment returns are relatively easier to trace and predict.Due to the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies, its operations and transactions can’t be controlled or accessed by the central bank, authorities or manipulated by intermediaries. This decentralization provides great transparency and control to crypto users. However, profits earned by trading assets in crypto are also subject to capital gains tax under the Income Tax act.The stock exchange market in India however works under the centralized regulation of the Reserve Bank Of India (RBI) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to curb mismanagement and prevent fraud.Last but not the least, due to the online mode of operation and absence of strong controls cryptocurrency trading is available 24×7 making it easier and accessible. The stock exchange market has limited access because of strict timings and few extended hours of operation.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85484589,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-18170,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-19,NDTV.com,Hackers Steal $97 Million From Japan Crypto Exchange In 2nd Major Heist,https://www.ndtv.com/business/hackers-steal-97-million-from-japanese-cryptocurrency-exchange-liquid-2514915,"Liquid said it had suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals while it assesses the impact of the attac

Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid was scrambling Friday to recover stolen assets worth nearly $100 million, in the second such major heist by hackers in recent days. The Tokyo-based company said in a statement Thursday that it had ""detected unauthorized access of some of the crypto wallets managed at Liquid"".

Elliptic, a London-based firm which helps track stolen cryptocurrencies, said its analysis found ""just over $97 million in cryptoassets have been received by the accounts identified by Liquid as belonging to the thief"".

""Our investigators are also aiding Liquid with tracking the stolen funds,"" Elliptic added in a blog post.

The heist comes after a hacker stole assets worth $600 million last week from cryptocurrency trading company Poly Network, before gradually giving the money back, claiming they had pulled off the theft to highlight a security flaw.

Liquid said it had suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals while it assesses the impact of the attack, although trading was continuing.

Cryptocurrencies have soared in popularity as assets in recent years, despite their volatility and concerns over their environmental impact as trading them requires vast quantities of electricity.

Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies use a technology called blockchain, which ensures that every transaction is recorded.

Thieves trying to steal cryptocurrencies typically move the funds through many different accounts at dizzying speed -- sometimes hundreds of thousands of transactions -- in an attempt to cover their tracks.

However, industry players have grown better at identifying and blocking stolen coins. Liquid said $16.3 million worth of stolen Ethereum had already been frozen ""due to the assistance of the crypto community and other exchanges"".","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/2r1h0gng_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none

Here's What To Know

For many people, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are part of an exciting and lucrative new financial frontier. But for the country's top market watchdog, Gary Gensler, they seem ""like the Wild West"" – and he's promising a crackdown.

The market for cryptocurrencies has ballooned. It is currently estimated to be worth about $2 trillion, thanks to the exploding popularity of Bitcoin and other virtual money like Dogecoin.

Amateur investors, particularly younger ones, have started buying and trading cryptocurrencies, attracted to the thrill of big returns. In the past year, the value of Bitcoin has risen 300%. And cryptocurrencies are increasingly also attractive to traditional investors.

But the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, and even as it becomes more mainstream, it continues to be popular among bad actors.

In recent months, hackers have demanded ransomware payments in Bitcoin, because it is easy to transfer and hard to trace. And there have been plenty of reports of thefts and heists at cryptocurrency exchanges in which cybercriminals have absconded with other people's virtual holdings.

In a recent speech, Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), denounced the lack of transparency and clear regulations, and promised the commission will take action to protect investors, which is a key part of the agency's mission.

""Investors really aren't getting the information to judge the risk, and understand the risk,"" Gensler said. ""If we don't address the issues, I worry a lot of people will get hurt.""

The process is still at the very beginning, but here's what to know.

So, who's Gensler?

Gensler is an experienced regulator, who has worked on Capitol Hill and in the Treasury Department. When he ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration, he played a key role writing and implementing new rules that apply to a segment of the market called derivatives.

Gensler also knows a lot about cryptocurrencies. Most recently, he was a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he focused ""on blockchain technology, digital currencies, financial technology, and public policy."" (One of his courses is available for free online.)

How are cryptocurrencies regulated right now?

The market has developed so fast, regulations haven't kept up. So policymakers have talked about reining in cryptocurrencies under a new regulatory framework for years. But so far, that hasn't happened.

That leaves millions of people who trade cryptocurrencies and assets related to them without clearly defined rules of trading.

It has also complicated life for professional investors and companies that do business with cryptocurrencies. Tiffany J. Smith, a partner at the law firm WilmerHale, who runs a cryptocurrency regulatory practice, helps her clients mitigate risk.

""In the absence of, you know, definitive regulation that applies to crypto assets, we work with them to craft policies, procedures, and processes,"" she says.

So what to expect first?

Clearer definitions is one of the most pressing issues.

Because cryptocurrencies are relatively new, there are not even universally agreed-upon definitions for some of the most basic terms. Can assets being traded on cryptocurrency exchanges be called securities, or are they something completely different? Is Bitcoin a commodity?

This goes beyond semantics; It can determine which regulator has the authority to regulate cryptocurrencies and related assets.

New York University Law School Professor Robert J. Jackson Jr., who used to be an SEC commissioner, says clarity is incredibly important.

""It's past time for regulators to be clear about who is responsible for this, and that clarity will be beneficial to the market,"" he says. ""It will be beneficial to investors. It will even be beneficial to those members of Congress and the other public policymakers who want to know whom to ask, and who to hold accountable for what is going on in those markets.""

What else can we also expect earlier on?

Determining jurisdiction will be critical as well.

So far, the SEC and the CFTC have shared regulatory responsibilities. They have tried to police cryptocurrencies with laws that are already on the books, even though they were really written for other traditional kinds of assets like stocks or bonds.

Smith expects this is likely to continue until there are new, cryptocurrency-specific regulations, meaning regulators will continue to adapt current frameworks for the virtual currency market.

""We are going to see both the SEC and the CFTC using their current authorities to regulate the market as best they can,"" says Smith.

But Gensler has called on Congress to give regulators the authority to write new rules.

He also wants more resources — more money and manpower — to regulate cryptocurrencies. For years, leaders of the SEC and the CFTC have complained that Congress hasn't given them enough money for them to their jobs.

Are there any specific actions expected?

There will be new proposed regulations for sure; It's just not clear in what form.

Gensler has not tipped his hand, and he did not spell out specific actions the SEC might be contemplating during his speech.

But in his speech, Gensler called for the need of ""guardrails,"" or actions intended to protect individual investors, for cryptocurrencies.

So the SEC is likely to take a closer look at aspects like the potential for market manipulation, determining basic rights for amateur investors and bringing in more transparency.

Congress is also proposing new rules. The Senate tucked in a provision to toughen tax enforcement on cryptocurrency players in its recent infrastructure bill, though the final fate remains uncertain given that the House has yet to weigh in.

How does the industry approach regulation?

So far, professional investors say they would actually welcome new regulations – as long as they are not too stringent.

Robert Jackson, the former S.E.C. commissioner, argues regulation will widen the appeal of cryptocurrency assets.

""The market will be better off, because assuring investors that they are getting the kind of transparent pricing they are used to in American markets will encourage other investors to consider the possibility of investing in cryptocurrency,"" he says.

But rules perceived as too stringent will inevitably spark fights. Lobbyists for the cryptocurrency industry tried to fight off Senate rules, calling the tax crackdown too broad.

How will new regulations change cryptocurrencies?

This is a fascinating existential question. Cryptocurrencies were borne of this iconoclastic desire for there to be assets untethered from governments and central banks. No one is really sure what will happen to it when that structure changes.

But many believe new regulations could help cryptocurrencies become a bigger part of our daily lives. For example, some companies, including AMC Theaters, have already announced they will accept cryptocurrencies as payment.","('https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/08/19/gettyimages-1234060979_wide-80455078d37f22a33cb4bc0ced8be44539c83d7b.jpg?s=1400',)",none

While the broader cryptocurrency market took a breather, Cardano's ada extended a stunning weeks-long rally early Friday morning, soaring 10% in a matter of hours as trading volume in the token, which last week became the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, swelled amid anticipation for a coming software upgrade that could help it compete with Ethereum.

Now the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, Cardano's ada has skyrocketed 1,300% this year. getty

Key Facts

Cardano's ada jumped more than 14% to a price of $2.49 by 12:52 a.m. EDT Friday, its highest point since a record of $2.46 on May 16, according to crypto data website CoinMarketCap, and taking its market capitalization above $75 billion. Reflecting investors' Thursday fervor, as of 11:00 p.m. EDT, more than $8 billion worth of ada tokens had traded hands in 24 hours—the highest one-day showing since a May price surge. The token has been on a steady tear this month, soaring 85% as Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson teased a September network upgrade, named Alonzo, that will enable the Cardano blockchain to process smart contracts, self-executing agreements between buyers and sellers that have helped Ethereum dominate the booming $100 billion decentralized finance industry. Prospects of a software upgrade have also boosted Ethereum to three-month highs in recent weeks, but Cardano's newer network, which still trails in adoption, has drawn skeptics like former billionaire hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz. In a tweet after ada became the world's third-largest cryptocurrency this month, Novogratz, a staunch bitcoin bull, said the token's rise was ""a mystery"" to him and suggested its platform was struggling to gain traction among software developers who build the programs necessary for a cryptocurrency's adoption. Hoskinson, who also cofounded Ethereum, hit back at the financier, responding to a tweet touting that Cardano requires less energy than Ethereum to process transactions and mocking Novogratz's background in the traditional banking space.

Key Background

Cardano's ada skyrocketed in May after billionaire Elon Musk soured on bitcoin and said Tesla would no longer accept the cryptocurrency due to the hefty environmental downside of the massive amounts of electricity used to “mine” new coins. The crypto market crashed and has yet to fully recover, but ada surged to new highs as investors flocked to more environmentally sustainable tokens. Hoskinson has claimed Cardano uses just 6 gigawatt hours of energy annually—not even 0.01% of the 115.85 terawatt hours bitcoin is estimated to use. The token plunged nearly 60% as the broader market collapsed this summer but has since started to outperform bitcoin and ether.

Surprising Fact

Ada has skyrocketed 1,300% this year alone, making it the best-performing top five cryptocurrency compared to returns of 1,030% for binance coin, 330% for ether and 59% for bitcoin. However, the token is also highly susceptible to the broader crypto market’s massive volatility. Ada crashed nearly 90% within less than two months in early 2018 as regulatory crypto crackdowns ushered in a years-long bear market for the nascent industry.

Tangent

Amid Cardano's late-night rally, the broader cryptocurrency market climbed less than 4% and floated around a total value of $2 trillion. The market soared above $2.5 trillion in May but plummeted amid concerns over regulations banning cryptocurrency mining in China.

This cryptocurrency use case can create a win-win situation.

Cryptocurrency holds immense potential via its application that can transform the financial ecosystem. Crypto coins that hold utility value will remove the market volatility eventually, and industries can benefit greatly from it, especially the entertainment industry.

The global entertainment industry is valued at a couple of trillion US dollars. With technological advancements, the volume of content consumption has increased, shedding light on the growth of the market. But this growth is not amounting to anything substantial as labels and corporations are depriving the creators and end consumers of the benefits. For example, Hollywood is known for its glitz, glamour, and big dollars. But at the grassroots level, Hollywood is controlled by two-three big studios, and now because of the pandemic, a few streaming companies. This exclusive control is expected to only bring doom to the entertainment industry.

In comparison, the cryptocurrency market is also influenced by few key players like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if a token has a utility that can compete with Bitcoin, it holds value to the end-user. Such is the case seen with XRP and Polkadot.

The dominance in the entertainment industry is demotivating studios from creating audience-centric content. Because it’s a matter of money, directors and professionals are focusing on fulfilling the studio’s demands, killing the essence of the entertainment industry.

Is Blockchain the Solution?

The incorporation of blockchain technology in the process of content creation will help in giving credit and ownership to content creators. To eliminate the financial burden, creators can tokenize their projects and use ICO-like initiatives to raise funds. This will also ensure that end-users have a substantial say in the content they want to watch.

Blockchain technology will also answer the question around piracy. The piracy and counterfeiting industry amounts to several billion dollars and with blockchain in the picture, it will be a herculean task to manipulate the digital ledger. Additionally, NFTs will also protect original content.

Techtainment – The Future of Entertainment Industry

The term technology + entertainment perfectly defines the future of the industry. Embracing blockchain and cryptocurrency will ensure the growth of the industry by financially backing individual artists and content producers. Blockchain and cryptocurrency can democratize the way end-users (audience) react and interact with artists and creators. As there is no proper channel for the audience to voice their opinions and social media is controlled by big corporations as well, blockchain is the only way to bring in a transparent voting system where the audience can vote for features like genre or concept of the content.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency-and-Blockchain.jpg',)",none

Most investors see cryptocurrency as a store of value and a means to make quick profits. But some of these virtual coins are gaining wider acceptance – as a payment option like the traditional rupee or dollar. The biggest endorsement for Bitcoin, the oldest and most popular of all these virtual currencies, came from billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk who said in July that his electric vehicle-making company Tesla will “most likely” start accepting payments in Bitcoin again. Several others have also announced that they would be accepting cryptoins as a payment option.

In India, too, you can buy items online and pay at selected restaurants in crypto coins. Though cryptocurrency has not received the backing of the government, the Supreme Court has reversed a 2018 RBI ban on its trade.

Here's where you can use cryptocurrencies to buy goods and services in India:

Suryawanshi Restaurants in Bengaluru's Indiranagar and Whitefield accept payment in Bitcoins. So, the next time you forget your wallet at home, don't panic as long as you can access your Bitcoin wallet. Along with traditional payment, the restaurant accepts Bitcoins as well.

Unocoin, an online cryptocurrency exchange, allows users to buy gift vouchers, ranging from Rs. 100 to Rs 5,000, from a list of 90 brands that include companies operating in the fields of travel, restaurants, lifestyle, clothing, accessories, hotels etc.

HighKart, the online e-commerce store, also accepts Bitcoin payments from customers. Products available on its website include mobile phones, cameras, clothes, electronics and computers.

The Rug Republic, the Delhi-based decor brand accepts payment in Bitcoin and 20 other top crypto coins as payment. As of now the brand is using WazirX and Binance to facilitate transactions but says it may develop an in-house payment system soon.

Apart from them, there are hundreds of outlets and brands internationally that have begun accepting payments in cryptocurrency, including the popular American NBA team Dallas Mavericks that accept the Dogecoin for tickets and merchandise.

Many people also made donations in cryptocurrency to help countries fight the COVID-19 pandemic and arrange the resources required. For example, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated Dogecoins worth $1 billion (roughly Rs 7000 crore) and former Australian cricketer Bret Lee gave one Bitcoin (roughly Rs 45 lakh) to India to help it fight the second wave.","('https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-01/cryptocurrency_650x400_61516192274.jpg',)",none

The bitcoin price remains off the closely-watched $50,000 per bitcoin level but ethereum has climbed back over the $3,000 mark after dipping under it earlier today.

Now, as cardano and solana make double-digit gains and outpace other cryptocurrencies, famed investment strategist Lyn Alden has predicted bitcoin will hit $100,000 and ethereum will reach $5,000 as soon as next year.

""I think we're still in kind of the early-to-mid stage of its long-term trajectory,"" Alden, who founded Lyn Alden Investment Strategy in 2016, told Insider in an interview. ""So that remains, I think, the best risk-reward as kind of a set-it-and-forget-it allocation.""

Alden believes bitcoin had a good chance of topping $100,000 at some point before the end of 2022 while a supply squeeze caused by a recent ethereum upgrade is ""tactically bullish"" and could send the ethereum price soaring to over $5,000.

The combined cryptocurrency market has recently returned to over $2 trillion, fueling many bullish bitcoin and ethereum predictions.

Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone has also said bitcoin could soon hit $100,000 while Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, thinks bitcoin is due a surge higher and will rally strongly through the second half of 2021.

The latest crypto rally has seen two rivals to ethereum's blockchain, cardano and solana, more than double in the last month alone.

The bitcoin price has added almost 300% over the last year though other smaller cryptocurrencies, ... [+] including ethereum, cardano, and solana, have made even bigger gains. Coinbase

""I think solana is a well-designed ethereum competitor,"" Alden said. ""Its main risk is that it's newer. It doesn't really have a significant network effect yet. And so it hasn't really reached a critical mass, but it is well-designed.""

Solana has close links with the rapidly growing FTX crypto exchange—FTX's sister company Alameda Research is an investor in solana, and FTX also operates its own decentralized exchange called Serum on the solana blockchain.

Cardano, now the third-biggest cryptocurrency by value after bitcoin and ethereum with a total value of $75 billion, has surged 30% during the last week as investors eye a much-anticipated upgrade that's due to be released on September 12. The completed upgrade will enable the cardano blockchain to support smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

""The upgrade will help cardano to match ethereum's capabilities,"" Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at Vienna-based brokerage Bitpanda, wrote in an emailed note.

Alden is less confident when it comes to cardano, however.

""We have to see what happens with cardano,"" Alden said. ""They have a lot of pipe, but they've had pretty slow development, so I tend to prefer solana over cardano.""","('https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5f7507b84b042f0a1785c377%2F0x0.jpg',)",none
2021-08-19,CNBC,Second-largest U.S. mortgage lender will accept payment in bitcoin,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/united-wholesale-mortgage-will-accept-bitcoin-other-cryptocurrency.html,"""We've evaluated the feasibility, and we're looking forward to being the first mortgage company in America to accept cryptocurrency to satisfy mortgage payments,"" CEO Mat Ishbia said in the company's second quarter earnings call on Monday.

United Wholesale Mortgage , which made its public debut in January via a special purpose acquisition (SPAC) merger, announced plans this week to accept cryptocurrency for home loans, in what is being billed as a first for the national mortgage industry.

Starting later this year, U.S. homebuyers will have the option to pay for their mortgage in bitcoin .

""That's something that we've been working on, and we're excited that hopefully, in Q3, we can actually execute on that before anyone in the country because we are a leader in technology and innovation.""

The Michigan-based mortgage company confirmed to CNBC that it's aiming to start by accepting bitcoin, though UWM is in the process of evaluating ether and other cryptocurrencies as well.

""We are evaluating the feasibility and requirements in order to accept cryptocurrency to satisfy mortgage payments,"" said Ishbia in a tweet via the company's account.

UWM – the nation's second-biggest mortgage lender after Quicken, the Detroit-based lending giant owned by Rocket Companies – works solely through wholesale channels, meaning that the company employs a fleet of brokers who then connect clients to home loans.

The push into decentralized digital money comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of crypto from all sides in the U.S.

Revamped crypto tax rules are a part of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, and financial authorities like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and Fed Chief Jerome Powell have all spoken recently on the topic of whether to regulate cryptocurrency.

It is unclear is whether UWM will hold the cryptocurrency it accepts or convert it to fiat at the point of transaction. The company did not immediately get back to CNBC with that information.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106758801-1603459526384-picture-perfect-beautiful-house-on-the-island-of-coronado-in-sunny-california-beautifully-landscaped_t20_6lJOrv.jpg?v=1603459593',)",none

deVere Group CEO Nigel Green told City AM on Wednesday that Ethereum’s recent run of good form and operability improvements has not gone unnoticed.

“Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin and it can be expected to continue this trend for the rest of 2021,” he said.

Green highlighted that Ethereum is up by more than 240%, outperforming all other benchmark assets, while Bitcoin is up less than 38% year to date.

In his view, there are two key factors driving Ethereum’s impressive performance.

“First, Ether has a higher level of real-use potential as Ethereum – the platform on which it is the native cryptocurrency – is the most in-demand development platform for smart contracts, thereby highlighting that network’s value not only as a platform for developers but as a worldwide financial utility,” he said.

“Second, investor enthusiasm for the game-changing transition to ETH 2.0, which makes the Ethereum network considerably more scalable, sustainable and secure.”

According to him, these upgrades represent a major boost, not just for Ethereum but for blockchain technology itself.

The deVere executive went on to state that his bullish bias towards Ethereum did not hinder his confidence in Bitcoin, and he continued to have optimistic price targets for the leading digital asset.

“I remain confident that Bitcoin will hit, or even surpass, its mid-April all-time high of $65,000 by the end of 2021,” he said.

However, Green maintained that Ethereum’s technical advantages over Bitcoin will mean that its value will exceed it, “probably within five years.”

“There will be peaks and troughs along the way of course, but Ethereum’s ascent to the top of the cryptoverse seems unstoppable,” he said.

Price Action: At press time, Ethereum was trading at $3,065, slightly up over the past 24-hours.

Bitcoin was also up by 0.11% during the same period and was trading at a price of $45,721 at the time of writing.

2021 has been a big year for cryptocurrency. But what’s next?

We’ve seen Bitcoin hit a new all-time high price, regulatory talks with potential to have big impact on the industry, and more institutional buy-in from major companies. All the while, people’s interest in crypto has skyrocketed this year: it’s a hot topic not only among investors but in popular culture too, thanks to everyone from long-standing investors like Elon Musk to that kid from your high school on Facebook.

In many ways, the first half of 2021 has been a “breakthrough,” says Dave Abner, head of global development at Gemini, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. “There’s tremendous focus and attention being paid to [the crypto industry].”

RELATED: Top Crypto News This Week

But the industry is only in its infancy and constantly evolving. It’s difficult to predict where things are headed long-term, but in the coming months, experts are following themes from regulation to institutional adoption of crypto payments to try and get a better sense of the market.

While exact predictions are impossible, we asked five experts about what they’re paying attention to in the crypto space for the rest of 2021:

Cryptocurrency Regulation

Expect continued conversations about cryptocurrency regulation. Lawmakers in Washington D.C. and across the world are trying to figure out how to establish laws and guidelines to make cryptocurrency safer for investors and less appealing to cybercriminals.

China reaffirmed its efforts to crack down on digital currencies this year, primarily through crypto mining regulations, while U.S. Senators have considered new regulation to bolster cryptocurrency tax reporting measures.

“Regulation is probably one of the biggest overhangs in the crypto industry globally,” says Jeffrey Wang, head of the Americas at Amber Group, a Canada-based crypto finance firm. “We would very much welcome clear regulation.”

Like most things with cryptocurrency, regulation comes with hurdles. “There are different agencies that may or may not have jurisdiction to oversee everything,” says Wang. “And it differs state by state.”

Both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have expressed their agencies’ interests in regulation, while Security and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has commented on both his own agency’s and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s role in policing the industry. Plus, the IRS has an obvious interest in making sure investors know how to report virtual currency when they file their taxes.

Clear regulation would mean the removal of a “significant roadblock for cryptocurrency,” says Wang, since U.S. firms and investors are operating without clear guidelines at the moment.

What new regulation could mean for investors

Recent proposed legislation could make it easier for the IRS to find cases of tax evasion when it comes to crypto, though investors should already keep records of any capital gains or losses on their crypto assets. But the new rules may also make it easier for investors to properly report crypto transactions.

“This is because if the bill passes, exchanges will have to issue 1099-B tax forms with cost basis information to investors,” Shehan Chandrasekera, CPA, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker.io, a crypto tax software company, recently told NextAdvisor. “This will significantly reduce the crypto tax filing burden.”

Regulatory announcements can also affect the price of cryptocurrency in already volatile markets. Market volatility is why investing experts recommend keeping any cryptocurrency investments to less than 5% of your total portfolio and never invest anything you’re not OK with losing.

Ultimately, many experts believe regulation is a good thing for the industry. “Sensible regulation is a win for everyone,” says Ben Weiss, CEO and cofounder of CoinFlip, a cryptocurrency buying platform and crypto ATM network. “It gives people more confidence in crypto, but I think it’s something we have to take our time on and we have to get it right.”

Possible Crypto ETF Approval

SEC Chairman Gensler recently hinted that investors may soon have access to a cryptocurrency ETF, which would represent a new and more conventional way to invest in crypto. A cryptocurrency ETF would allow investors to buy cryptocurrency directly from traditional investment brokerages they may already have accounts with, like Fidelity or Vanguard.

“We do it in the equity market, we do it in the bond markets, people might want it here,” Gensler said at the Aspen Security Forum earlier this month, while also acknowledging there have already been filings for crypto ETFs with his agency.

ETF approval has been in consideration by the SEC multiple times over the past few years, but none have yet been greenlighted as in other regions, like Canada and the EU.

“I was anticipating that approval would happen before the end of 2021. I’m still hopeful for that,” says Abner. “There’s obviously a lot of people looking at it with the other regulation that is being introduced. That could potentially slow things down, but I think there’s still a possibility you could see some approval, either at the end of this year, or at least early in 2022.”

What a crypto ETF would mean for investors

Crypto ETFs are not yet available in the U.S., but approval could mean more Americans buying in and influencing the crypto market. Instead of learning to navigate a cryptocurrency exchange to trade your digital assets, you could add crypto to your portfolio directly from the same brokerage with which you already have a retirement or other traditional investment account.

However, investing in a crypto ETF would still carry the same risk as any crypto investment — it’s a portfolio of assets, but would be diversified only by different cryptocurrencies, which are all speculative and volatile. If you’re not willing to lose the money you put into crypto by purchasing on an exchange or an eventual crypto fund, you should carefully consider if you’re willing to take on the risk of having cryptocurrency in your portfolio at all.

Broader Institutional Cryptocurrency Adoption

Mainstream companies across industries have taken interest — and in some cases themselves invested in — cryptocurrency and blockchain in 2021. AMC, for example, recently announced it will be able to accept Bitcoin payments by the end of this year. Fintech companies like PayPal and Square are also betting on crypto by allowing users to buy on their platforms. Tesla continues to go back and forth on its acceptance of Bitcoin payments, though the company holds billions in crypto assets. Experts predict more and more of this buy-in.

“We’ve seen a tremendous amount of inflow of attention, and that’s going to continue to drive the growth of the industry for a while now,” says Abner.

Some experts predict bigger, global corporations could jumpstart this adoption even more in the latter half of this year. “What we’re looking at is institutions getting involved in crypto, whether it’s Amazon or the big banks,” says Weiss. A huge retailer like Amazon could “create a chain reaction of others accepting it,” and would “add a lot of credibility.”

Indeed, Amazon has recently sparked rumors that it’s making moves to that end by sharing a job posting for a “digital currency and blockchain product lead.” Walmart is also recruiting a crypto expert to oversee its blockchain strategy.

What more institutional adoption means for investors

While paying for things in cryptocurrencies doesn’t make sense for most people right now, more retailers accepting payments might change that landscape in the future. It’ll likely be much longer before it’ll be a smart financial decision to spend Bitcoin on goods or services, but further institutional adoption could bring about more use-cases for everyday users, and in turn, have an impact on crypto prices. Nothing is guaranteed, but if you buy cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value, the more “real world” uses it has, the more likely demand and value will increase.

Bitcoin’s Future Outlook

Bitcoin is a good indicator of the crypto market in general, because it’s the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the rest of the market tends to follow its trends.

Bitcoin’s price has taken a wild ride so far in 2021, from a high point of $60,000 in April to less than $30,000 as recently as July. More recently, Bitcoin has climbed back toward $50,000. This volatility is a big part of why experts recommend keeping your crypto investments to less than 5% of your portfolio to begin with.

But how high will Bitcoin go? Bitcoin’s past may provide some clues, according to Kiana Danial, author of “Cryptocurrency Investing for Dummies.”

Danial says there have been plenty of huge spikes followed by pullbacks in Bitcoin’s price since 2011. “What I expect from Bitcoin is volatility short-term and growth long-term.”

Others are more bullish on Bitcoin’s short-term growth.

Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at TokenMetrics, a cryptocurrency analytics platform, thinks the price of Bitcoin will climb throughout the rest of the year. “I think it’s more likely Bitcoin goes to $75,000 than $25,000,” he says.

What Bitcoin price volatility means for investors

Bitcoin’s volatility is more reason for investors to play a steady long game. If you’re buying for long-term growth potential, then don’t worry about short-term swings. The best thing you can do is not look at your cryptocurrency investment, or “set it and forget it.” As experts continue to tell us each time there’s a price swing — whether up or down — emotional reaction can cause investors to act rashly and make decisions that result in losses on their investment.

The Future of Cryptocurrency

We can speculate on what value cryptocurrency may have for investors in the coming months and years (and many will), but the reality is it’s still a new and speculative investment, without much history on which to base predictions. No matter what a given expert thinks or says, no one really knows. That’s why it’s important to only invest what you’re prepared to lose, and stick to more conventional investments for long-term wealth building.

“If you were to wake one morning to find that crypto has been banned by the developed nations and it became worthless, would you be OK?” Frederick Stanield, a CFP with Lifewater Wealth Management in Atlanta, Georgia, told NextAdvisor recently.

Keep your investments small, and never put crypto investments above any other financial goals like saving for retirement and paying off high interest debt.","('https://time.com/nextadvisor/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/na-the-future-of-crypto-1000x630.jpg',)",none
2021-08-19,CNBC,More than $90 million in cryptocurrency stolen after a top Japanese exchange is hacked,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/liquid-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack.html,"Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid said Thursday it has been hit by a cyberattack that saw hackers make off with a reported $97 million worth of digital coins.

Liquid said some of its digital currency wallets had been ""compromised,"" and that hackers were transferring the assets to four different wallets.

""We are currently investigating and will provide regular updates,"" Liquid tweeted. ""In the meantime deposits and withdrawals will be suspended.""

Liquid did not provide an estimate for the loss. It says it is regulated by Japan's Financial Services Agency. The watchdog was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

Elliptic, a blockchain analytics company, said its analysis showed that about $97 million in cryptocurrencies have been obtained by the hackers.

Of the total haul, $45 million in tokens were being converted to ethereum through decentralized exchanges — blockchain-based platforms that require no intermediaries — like Uniswap and SushiSwap, Elliptic said.

""This enables the hacker to avoid having these assets frozen — as is possible with many Ethereum tokens,"" Elliptic said in a blog post.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106930253-1629367715182-gettyimages-1234739851-porzycki-internet210817_npTeY.jpeg?v=1629368128',)",none

“Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, and it can be expected to continue this trend for the rest of 2021,” he said.

Secondly, Green commented that investor enthusiasm for the “game-changing” transition to Ethereum 2.0 represents a major boost not just for Ether but for blockchain technology itself.

“Ultimately, this will mean that its value will exceed that of Bitcoin — probably within five years”

The company executive isn’t bearish on Bitcoin (BTC), however, and remains confident that Bitcoin will have hit, or even have surpassed, its mid-April all-time high of $65,000 by the end of 2021. However, Green concluded that:

“Ethereum’s ascent to the top of the cryptoverse seems unstoppable.”

In early June, deVere launched a fixed-yield bond that tracks futures of Bitcoin and Ether on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

According to United Kingdom crypto exchange CoinJar, Ether has flipped Bitcoin in almost every metric that matters. In a blog post on Wednesday, the exchange stated that Ether is already surpassing Bitcoin in a number of areas, including the number of transactions, total value transacted, daily active wallets, transaction fees and mining revenue.

According to Coinbase’s second-quarter report, Ether’s trading volume has flipped Bitcoin’s for the first time in its nine-year history.

Trading in ETH made up 26% of total volumes in the second quarter, up from 21% in the previous three months, and higher than Bitcoin’s 24% for the period.","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDgvYzZkNzgwZTYtODBmYi00NmJkLThhNzktYjhmMjhhZDJjOWEwLmpwZw==.jpg',)",none
2021-08-19,CNBC,Cryptocurrency traders seek damages from Binance after a major outage cost them millions,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/cryptocurrency-traders-seek-damages-from-binance-after-major-outage.html,"In this article BTC.CM=

When Canadian cryptocurrency trader Fawaz Ahmed saw the price of ethereum dropping, he knew it was time to get out. Unfortunately for him, he couldn't. Ahmed was trading on Binance, the world's largest digital currency exchange by trading volume. And on May 19, Binance experienced a major outage which meant that, for about an hour, he was unable to exit his position. That day, bitcoin and ethereum posted their biggest one-day drops since March 2020, with the entire crypto market losing roughly $1 trillion in value. When prices fell below a certain point, Ahmed's position got wiped out. His personal losses came to about $6 million. ""This loss was not fair,"" Ahmed, a 33-year-old who trades full-time, told CNBC. ""This is something which was out of my control."" Binance's customer service team gave Ahmed an ""absurdly"" low offer of compensation, he said. Ahmed is one of hundreds of investors expected to take part in arbitration proceedings against Binance, seeking damages for the money they lost when the cryptocurrency exchange went offline. Binance said it was unable to comment on ""pending legal matters."" ""Our policy is fair in that we compensate users who experienced actual trading losses due to our system's issues,"" a spokesperson for the firm told CNBC. ""We do not cover hypothetical 'what could have been' situations such as unrealized profits.""

Binance has experienced several outages over the years in times of heightened volatility for virtual currencies. That can be costly for traders, especially when prices are plunging. And those losses can balloon to millions of dollars when investors make risky bets using leverage, or borrowed money, to augment trades — which, on Binance, is something users do often. Binance recently cut the maximum leverage customers can take on futures — financial derivatives that oblige investors to buy an asset at an agreed-upon price at a later date — to 20 times from a previous limit of 125 times. Binance wasn't the only crypto exchange to face disruption to its service on May 19. Coinbase users were also temporarily unable to access its site. Bitcoin plunged as much as 30% to nearly $30,000 that day. It has since recovered to $45,790.

No headquarters

Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, Binance's boss, has previously said the exchange has no official headquarters. That makes it extremely difficult for investors to figure out how, and where, to take the company to court. A group of crypto traders hopes to change that. With the help of Liti Capital, a little-known Swiss private equity firm providing litigation financing, nearly 1,000 people are expected to join arbitration proceedings in Hong Kong to seek damages from Binance. ""This is a landmark case for the industry,"" David Kay, chief investment officer of Liti Capital, told CNBC.

Binance is ""the first company that has ever grown to any size in any industry — much less the financial industry — where there is no regulation,"" he said. ""They have no home, they have no headquarters, they have no office."" ""The only place where Binance has said they have jurisdiction is in a Hong Kong international arbitration court,"" Kay added. ""This will be the largest consumer international arbitration in history."" Kay said that Liti Capital began working on the Binance case after receiving a call from Aija Lejniece, an independent lawyer working with a group of crypto traders in France. Lejniece specializes in international arbitration cases. Binance's terms of use say that any legal dispute must be resolved through arbitration at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre. Arbitration proceedings, unlike class action lawsuits, aim to settle disputes out of court. The format makes it harder for the average consumer to make a claim, Kay said, as claimants have to pay arbitration fees and additional costs — for instance, traveling to Hong Kong. Individually, that could set each claimant back an estimated $65,000. To cover those costs, Liti Capital has promised to provide a minimum of $5 million in funding.

White & Case, a New York-based law firm, has been hired to represent the claimants. Abby Cohen Smutny and Darryl Lew, two White & Case partners based in Washington, D.C., and Hong Kong-based partner Melody Chan, will serve as their lawyers.

2021-08-19,News18,"Cryptocurrency: How to Invest in Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Other Crypto Coins in India",https://www.news18.com/news/business/cryptocurrency-how-to-invest-in-bitcoin-ether-dogecoin-other-crypto-coins-in-india-4103234.html,"Cryptocurrency is the latest asset class in the financial market which gives you an opportunity to invest and earn a hefty return. Though cryptocurrencies don’t have any official global or governmental backing like your other financial instruments, the popularity they have seen in recent years has been quite robust. Most of this popularity stems from famous billionaire tycoons like Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey actively voicing their opinions on digital currency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum being an asset.

This has brought crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum to the forefront of the public domain and has the average citizen interested in investing in it. It should be noted that recently, the crypto market has taken a beating and prices for some of the most popular coins saw an all-time low. However, experts believe that due to rising demand and interest, the market will recover and even move upwards.

With so much going for cryptocurrency and especially in India where so many are advocating for its classification as an asset, you should know exactly how to invest. Here are the basic steps you need to carry out to successfully invest in cryptocurrency.

Step 1: Finding the Right Crypto Exchange

Cryptocurrencies are not regulated in India, hence there is no established structure or uniformity to trading in cryptocurrency yet. This is where crypto exchanges come in. They act as a platform through which you can buy and sell your digital assets. Some of the more popular exchanges in India include WazirX, CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Step 2: Create your Account

After finalising the exchange that best suits your needs, create an account similar to that in a bank. Depending on the policies you opt for, the amount you plan to invest and what you plan to invest in, the exchange will ask you to verify. They will ask you to submit documentary proofs to prevent cases of fraud.

Step 3: Setting up the Account for Action

Before you can buy any cryptocurrencies, you will need money in your account. The money can be put in via a wire transfer from your normal bank account to the exchange account. Make sure to link both. Also, depending on the policy you may have to face a waiting period before purchases can take place.

Step 4: Buying Cryptocurrency, Making the Investment

Once you have everything set up, you need to pick which coin or coins you may want to invest in. The most popular one by far is Bitcoin, followed by other altcoins such as Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin, Tether, XRP and Dogecoin to name a few. After you make your purchase comes the most important part – storage. Crypto exchanges don’t have any formal institution backing them and they most certainly do not carry your average insurance policy. They also face the risk of being hacked. Therefore, it is important you store your codes to your account and your assets securely. It is often more advisable to store your bought coins in a crypto wallet.

Bitcoin Price Today

Bitcoin price slipped 0.94 per cent in last 24 hours to $44,799.18 on Thursday. Over the last seven days, the coin dropped 0.58 per cent. Other coins such as Ether and Cardano have been trading in red and green respectively. Ether price dropped 1.21 per cent in the last 24 hours to settle at $3,011.60 on Thursday. Meanwhile, Cardano was up by 5.24 per cent at $2.13.

Speaking on the upward trend of Bitcoin, ZebPay Trade Desk said, “Bitcoin has made an impressive comeback over the past week or so, up almost 45 per cent from its recent lows. The market sentiment towards the asset has turned, and gone are the days where people would say that the asset might test $20,000 levels.”

NEW DELHI: Ever since cryptocurrencies arrived on the world investment scene in 2009, their journey has been astonishing.Although there has been a rush of investors jumping on to the crypto bandwagon in the past few years, their volume has not reached anywhere near that of stocks, precious metals, forex and commodities.Online platforms such as Bloomberg and Investopedia have estimated that there are around 1.5 crore crypto investors in India already.More than 350 start-ups have been working in the blockchain and crypto space in India. They estimate that crypto investment from Indians have shot up from $923 million in April 2020 to around $6.6 billion in the last fiscal.But many investors continue to sit on the fence, unable to fully grasp the viability of cryptocurrencies as an investment. To ease them into the system, here we have dope on 7 top cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be born and remains the most powerful until today: very high in value and the most preferred one by investors globally.However, it is also highly volatile and sometimes its price oscillates widely. Some of those who have invested in Bitcoin in the past decade are now millionaires.In Indian Rupee, the cost of one Bitcoin has never come down below Rs 35 lakhs and during the fiscal year 2020-21 it even hit Rs 56 lakh.The volatility had not worried investors as those who invest in whole Bitcoins got their value back plus the premium.Investors buying in fractions need to follow the graphs closely to get a bang for their buck and not lose money. There are hardcore Bitcoin investors who have invested sums as low as Rs 100 and improved their earnings 20-30 times in value. Bitcoin is also a favourite of day traders.Bitcoins are also perceived as precious as they were meant to be finite - there can be no more than 21 million bitcoins created.Believe it or not, this came out of a dog meme that went viral on the internet. Dogecoin was created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Unlike Bitcoin, which is designed to be scarce, the Dogecoin is intentionally abundant — 10,000 new coins are mined every minute and there is no ceiling on the maximum supply.Due to their abundance, small investors are picking them up in sizable volumes. Though its base price is lower than most of the other digital coins, the sheer volume it generates on the exchanges is astounding.Investors are currently wondering if the Dogecoin will ever reach $1 in price. When it does, it will be bonanza time.Ethereum works on a decentralized software platform. It has inbuilt smart contracts and a decentralized applications system.It can be built and operated without any time lag. You can steer clear of dubious transactions and gain full control as an investor in terms of value, transaction and transfer.One extraordinary feature of Ethereum is that it is bereft of any interference or control from any non-specific operators. Ethereum was launched in 2015. Currently it has 19 percent of market capitalisation of the dominant counterpart Bitcoin.Litecoin came into being in 2011. It was one of the first cryptocurrencies following the birth of Bitcoin.It is touted as the silver alter ego of the Golden Bitcoin. But looking at the excitement it has created among the new generation of investors, it may strike gold soon.Litecoin works on a faster block generation rate, which enables the investor to get faster transaction confirmation. So far in 2021, the Litecoin capitalised $10.1 billion and boasts of a value of $153.88 on a per token basis. It is the sixth-largest cryptocurrency in the world.Its founder Charles Hoskinson was one of the five co-founders of Ethereum and it is created in the same genre.Being unhappy with the direction of Ethereum, Hoskinson parted ways and founded Cardano on the environmentally sustainable, Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol with the help of mathematicians, engineers, and cryptographists.Cardano has established a market capitalization of $9.8 billion and each coin trades at $ 0.39.With high interoperability within the blockchains of the same genre, Polkadot perches comfortably among the cryptocurrencies of its size.Polkadot is embedded with systems that enable its developers to create their blockchains.At the same time it is said to be uncompromising on security and safety. At $11.2 billion market capitalization, one DOT has traded for $12.54 since January 2021.Coming from the stable of Bitcoin, BCH has the unique advantage of automatically being connected to Bitcoin. But investors will do well to compare it with non-Bitcoin stable currencies, coins or tokens.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85454009,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-111102,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

2021-08-19,Moneycontrol,India ranks second in global cryptocurrency adoption index,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/india-ranks-second-in-global-cryptocurrency-adoption-index-7359841.html,"Most of the top 20 countries are developing countries like Tanzania, Togo and Kenya.

India ranks second in the global cryptocurrency adoption index only behind Vietnam, according to the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

The worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency has grown by over 2,300 percent since the third quarter of 2019 and over 881 percent in the last year.

“Our research suggests that reasons for this increased adoption differ around the world — in emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions, while adoption in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia over the last year has been powered largely by institutional investment,” the report said.

The ranking was based on three metrics including peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trading volume and value received. India was followed by Pakistan and Ukraine at rank three and four respectively. The US and China’s ranking dipped from sixth to eighth and from fourth to thirteenth respectively.

The report attributes this drop in ranking to falling P2P volumes in the two countries compared to worldwide volumes.

Most of the top 20 countries are developing countries like Tanzania, Togo and Kenya. “Many emerging markets face significant currency devaluation, driving residents to buy cryptocurrency on P2P platforms in order to preserve their savings. Others in these areas use cryptocurrency to carry out international transactions, either for individual remittances or for commercial use cases, such as purchasing goods to import and sell,” the report said.

“Many emerging markets represented here limit the amount of the national currency that residents can move out of the country. Cryptocurrency gives those residents a way to circumvent those limits so that they can meet their financial needs,” it added.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/07/Cryptocurrency-1-770x433.jpg',)",none

The Indian government has been sitting on the fence for a long time over cryptocurrencies in the country. A much-awaited cryptocurrency bill in this regard has been tabled before the Union Cabinet and awaits its approval. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that the cabinet note was ready on cryptocurrency (bill), and that she was awaiting Cabinet to clear that. Earlier, an inter-ministerial panel, headed by the Secretary (Economic Affairs), had submitted its report on cryptocurrency. Currently, cryptocurrencies are under no regulation in India, which makes it a grey area for Indian investors.

Cryptocurrency and legislation

The central government had formed the inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency in order to examine the issues related to digital currencies. According to reports, the panel recommended all private cryptocurrencies be prohibited in India. However, virtual currencies issued by the state may be allowed. During the Monsoon Session in the Parliament, the cryptocurrency bill was expected to be tabled but it did not happen.

According to the bulletin for the Budget Session prepared by the Lok Sabha Secretariat, the bill “seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India”. But it allows a few exceptions in order to promote the technology behind cryptocurrencies and their uses.

The Reserve Bank of India and cryptocurrency

In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) brought out an advisory notice to ""all the entities regulated by it not to deal in"" cryptocurrency. However, in 2020, the Supreme Court lifted the central bank's ban and allowed banks and financial institutions to provide services even if they were related to digital currencies.

In May 2021, the Deputy Governor of RBI said that they were considering ways to bring out a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The cryptocurrency bill could facilitate its coming.

Indian cryptocurrency investments

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that are growing popular among Indian investors. These currencies basically disrupt the central bank model of transaction and trading. Indians have invested over $6 million in cryptocurrencies. Almost 1.5 crore Indians are estimated to have made these investments. Several hundred startups have also started operating in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-02/kq34jumk_cryptocurrency-bitcoin-reuters_625x300_11_February_21.jpg',)",none

They have found USB sticks containing large quantities of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world after Bitcoin. The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the scheme cheated people from the UK, US, Europe, China, Australia, and Hong Kong. The victims deposited money, some even their entire life's savings, believing it to be a genuine saving and trading service using Binance Smart Chain. Two people were arrested for alleged fraud and money laundering, but they have been released under investigation.

The discovery has brought into focus the anonymous and international nature of these virtual currencies. Criminals often take advantage of anonymity to launder money and for terrorism, tax fraud, and drug trafficking. Although a majority of cryptocurrency transactions are legitimate, many are also fraudulent.

GMP's Economic Crime Unit said a total of $9.5 million (roughly Rs. 70.6 crores) in stolen Ethereum was discovered in the seized USB sticks. The police found another $12.7 million (roughly Rs. 94.4 crores) a few days later after finding an online safe (a cryptograph safety deposit box) and its access code.

The GMP said they have begun locating the rightful owners, some of whom are still unknown and spread across the world, and reuniting them with their money.

One of the victims of the fraud, who wished to remain anonymous, told the police that he had been using cryptocurrency for years. “The hack really surprised us at first,” he added, thanking the police for tracking the money.

GMP said the victim will now get 90 percent of his investment back and if all the funds remain unclaimed, he will receive the full amount.

Detective Chief Inspector Joe Harrop of the Economic Crime Unit said people are increasingly moving online and see cryptocurrency as the future of money and trading. But this shift is also leading to a new type of crime and opportunist criminals are looking to exploit these trends as well as any gaps in the technology. Harrop said policing also needs to adapt to this emerging type of crime.

2021-08-19,Gadgets 360,"India, Vietnam, Pakistan Among Top Measure of Cryptocurrency Adoption by Individuals: Chainalysis",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-adoption-individual-rate-highest-india-vietnam-pakistan-chainalysis-881-percent-growth-2513826,"Global cryptocurrency adoption among individual investors has surged in the past year, according to crypto-analysis firm Chainalysis.

Using factors like peer-to-peer exchange trading volume and value received, Chainalysis said global cryptocurrency adoption rose some 881 percent in the past 12 months.

The firm sees institutional markets as crucial but aimed to highlight the countries with the greatest cryptocuurrency adoption by retail investors. It focused on use cases related to transactions and individual saving, rather than trading and speculation. Top-ranked countries are Vietnam, India, Pakistan, and Ukraine.

“In emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions,” Chainalysis said in the report. It added that “adoption in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia over the last year has been powered largely by institutional investment.”

Interest in cryptocurrencies has surged since the onset of the pandemic, in part because of substantial gains by digital tokens like Bitcoin and Ether. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index has climbed about 380 percent in the past year. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 34.71 lakhs while Ethereum price in India stood at Rs. 2.34 lakhs as of 10am IST on August 19.

The Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index ranked 154 countries by three main metrics. China and the US both dropped in the rankings, primarily because peer-to-peer trading volume declined. Last year, China ranked fourth and the US sixth. This year, the US is eighth and China 13th.

Chainalysis took out one factor it had used previously: number of deposits by country weighted by number of Internet users. The firm found that it skewed the rankings toward countries with comparatively more decentralised finance, or DeFi, users. Instead, it's creating a DeFi Adoption Index that it said will be available in coming weeks.

“Growing transaction volume for centralized services and the explosive growth of DeFi are driving cryptocurrency usage in the developed world and in countries that already had substantial adoption, while P2P platforms are driving new adoption in emerging markets,' Chainalysis said, adding a key question is whether new approaches will disrupt those trends.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped Bitcoin rally.

Key Highlights Many retail investors are now opening accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges to trade/invest in this asset class. Like stocks, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined by demand, supply and market dynamics. Similar to stocks, cryptocurrency transaction on an exchange involves certain transaction costs.

New Delhi: Gradually cryptocurrencies are finding a place in the portfolios of retail investors as they believe this asset class will soon emerge as the most lucrative asset class of the 21st century. Many retail investors are now opening accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges to trade/invest in this asset class. Like stocks, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined by demand, supply and market dynamics. Similar to stocks, cryptocurrency transaction on an exchange involves certain transaction costs. New investors should be aware of the costs involved in cryptocurrency trading. Here are the different transaction costs levied by crypto exchanges.

Exchange/trading fees: Exchange fee or trading fee is the amount charged by the cryptocurrency exchange for executing a buy or sell transaction. Typically, in India, crypto exchanges charge transaction fee as a fixed percentage of trade value. For example, WazirX, which is a cryptocurrency exchange, follows a flat fee structure of 0.2% for everyone. ""People can also pay trading fee using WRX on WazirX to avail 50% discount on fees, thereby making it the lowest trading fee in India at just 0.1%,"" said Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX.

Some crypto exchanges also follow a variable fee model depending on the volume of trading. If you are an active trader or you have transacted a high value over a longer rolling period, you may negotiate a lower trading fee with the exchange. So, investors are advised to do their own research before registering with a particular exchange so that they can get the best brokerage as per their trading volume.

It may be noted that exchange fee is the primary source of revenue for crypto exchanges and forms an integral part of their business model.

Network fees: Other than exchange fees or trading fees, crypto investors will also have to pay network fee, which is payable to the cryptocurrency miners for the work they do. Crypto miners are individuals who work with powerful computers to verify and validate transactions to be added to a blockchain. Miners play an integral role in crypto transactions by ensuring that tokens weren’t spent twice and transactions are real and true.

Worth mentioning here is that cryptocurrency exchanges have no direct control over the network fees and it is payable to the miners/validator of the network. When the network becomes crowded on the back of high demand, network fees may increase. Miners are paid these fees for the electricity and vast processing power required to process crypto transactions.

Wallet fees: This fee is similar to the demat fee that we pay for trading in shares. Cryptocurrencies are stored in a digital wallet, which is like an online bank account, meant for the safekeeping of the cryptocurrency. These digital wallets make it easier for you to use the cryptocurrency and send it to others.

Most of the wallets don’t charge any fee for holding the cryptocurrency but charge a fee at the time of withdrawing/sending cryptocurrency from the wallet which is basically network fees. ""We don't charge any fees on holding crypto in your WazirX wallet. We do charge crypto withdrawal fee and it is the lowest in India starting from zero fee,"" said Nischal Shetty of WazirX.

Worth mentioning here is that crypto wallets also offer systematic cryptocurrency buying options and have integrated merchant gateway service using which you can pay for transactions such as smartphone recharge, DTH recharge using cryptocurrency.","('https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/1564484114-cryptocurrency_getty.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top',)",none
2021-08-19,CNBC,This map shows where cryptocurrency is taking off around the world,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/new-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-user-global-map.html,"Global adoption of cryptocurrency has taken off in the last year, up 881%, with Vietnam, India and Pakistan firmly in the lead, according to new data from Chainalysis. It is the second year the blockchain data firm has released its Global Crypto Adoption Index, which ranks 154 countries according to metrics such as peer-to-peer exchange trading volume, rather than gross transaction volume, which typically favors developed nations with high levels of professional and institutional crypto buy-in. Chainalysis said the purpose of the index is to capture crypto adoption by ""ordinary people"" and to ""focus on use cases related to transactions and individual saving, rather than trading and speculation."" The metrics are weighted to incorporate the wealth of the average person and the value of money generally within particular countries. Most of the top 20 countries are emerging economies, including Togo, Colombia and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the United States slipped from sixth to eighth place, and China, which cracked down on crypto this spring, dropped from fourth to 13th.

Chainalysis ascribes the rising adoption levels in emerging markets to a few key factors. For one, countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, Vietnam and Venezuela have huge transaction volumes on peer-to-peer, or P2P, platforms when adjusted for purchasing power parity per capita and the internet-using population. Chainalysis reports that many residents use P2P cryptocurrency exchanges as their primary on-ramp into cryptocurrency, often because they don't have access to centralized exchanges. The report also says many residents of these countries turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, as well as to send and receive remittances and carry out business transactions.

Matt Ahlborg, a peer-to-peer data analyst, told CNBC that Vietnam is one of the top markets for Bitrefill, a company that helps customers live on cryptocurrency by buying gift cards using bitcoin. ""Vietnam stood out to me because it dominated the index,"" said Chainalysis' director of research, Kim Grauer, who compiled the report. ""We heard from experts that people in Vietnam have a history of gambling, and the young, tech-savvy people don't have much to do with their funds in terms of investing in a traditional ETF, both of which drive crypto adoption,"" Grauer said. Nigeria is a different story, Grauer said. ""It has a huge commercial market for crypto. More and more commerce is done on the rails of cryptocurrency, including international trade with counter parties in China.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106930082-1629323396701-20210818-thumb-SKxR8-the-chainalysis-2021-global-crypto-adoption-index.png?v=1629323412',)",none
2021-08-19,CNBC,"Nvidia beats earnings expectations, but cryptocurrency chip sales falter",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/nvidia-nvda-earnings-q2-2022.html,"Nvidia's graphics segment, which is primarily made up of graphics cards, grew 87% to $3.91 billion, growing faster than the compute and network segment, which includes chips for data centers. Compute and network grew 46% to $2.6 billion.

Graphics chips like Nvidia makes are increasingly important for a variety of technologies including gaming, artificial intelligence and types of cryptocurrency mining.

Nvidia is in a period of sustained, massive growth in its business as semiconductors are in short supply worldwide and as demand for the kind of processors that the company specializes in skyrockets. Nvidia's revenue rose 68% annually during the quarter. In the previous quarter, sales grew 84% .

However, Nvidia's cryptocurrency chip product, CMP, had lower sales, at $266 million, than the $400 million the company predicted in May. Shares of Nvidia were up more than 2% in after-hours trading.

Nvidia reported earnings on Wednesday for its second fiscal quarter , which ended Aug. 1, beating Wall Street estimates because of strong graphics card sales.

Broken down by market instead of reportable segment, one highlight was gaming, which was up 85% to $3.06 billion. Nvidia has had supply issues since late last year as its latest line of graphics cards has remained mostly sold out in stores, and the company said in May that it expected supply issues through the second half of the year. The company said Wednesday that it was seeing longer lead times throughout its supply chain.

Nvidia said the increase in gaming sales was due to both GeForce graphics card sales as well as the chips it sells to game console makers, such as the processor at the heart of the Nintendo Switch.

Nvidia's data center business also hit an all-time high, growing 35% annually to $2.37 billion, which the company attributed to graphics cards for data centers, both in industrial uses and among cloud providers.

Investors are closely watching how correlated Nvidia's business is to cryptocurrency prices.

Cryptocurrency revenue fell short of expectations, reporting $266 million in cryptocurrency card sales, more than 33% lower than expectations. Nvidia forecast in May that the dedicated chips it makes for mining cryptocurrency, called CMP, would have sales of around $400 million in the August quarter.

Nvidia says its cryptocurrency cards are an effort to ensure there is enough chip supply for gamers and it applied software to its GPUs to prevent them from mining cryptocurrencies. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that it expects a ""minimal contribution"" from its CMP sales going forward.

Nvidia's professional visualization segment, mostly graphics cards for high-end professional workstations, were up 156% annually to $519 million. Its automotive business remains a small portion of the company's sales, with $152 million in sales, down sequentially from the most recent quarter and up 37% from the same quarter last year, which was in the middle of the global Covid-19 pandemic that snarled auto production.

Last year, Nvidia said it planned to buy Arm, which makes important intellectual property for mobile chips, for $40 billion. The deal is opposed by some of Nvidia's competitors, which worry that they may lose access to important Arm technology.

""Although some Arm licensees have expressed concerns or objected to the transaction, and discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought, we are confident in the deal and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, its licensees, and the industry,"" Nvidia said in a statement.

Nvidia split its stock 4-for-1 in June. Shares are up over 57% in the last year.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106747420-1602840895304-GettyImages-902419318_1.jpg?v=1602842165',)",none
2021-08-19,CNBC,Ohio man pleads guilty to running $300 million bitcoin laundering conspiracy that helped drug traffickers,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/ohio-man-guilty-in-darknet-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-laundering-conspiracy.html,"An Ohio man pleaded guilty in a money laundering conspiracy in which he moved more than $300 million worth of bitcoin to help users, including drug traffickers, hide the source of their cryptocurrency.

Larry Dean Harmon, 38, of Akron, agreed as part of his plea in Washington, D.C., federal court to surrender more than 4,400 bitcoins, currently valued at more than $200 million, the Justice Department said Wednesday.

Harmon, who maintained a residence in the nation of Belize during his criminal activity, also faces assessment of a $60 million civil monetary penalty from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, authorities said.

He will be sentenced at a date to be scheduled. He faces a maximum prison term of 20 years and potential fines of hundreds of millions of dollars.

The Darknet is the collection of websites hidden from normal search engines and web browsers. Its anonymized nature is exploited by criminals who trade weapons, narcotics and illegal services.

As part of his guilty plea, Harmon admitted that his Darknet-based service, Helix, partnered with several Darknet markets, such as AlphaBay, Evolution and Cloud 9, to provide bitcoin money laundering services for customers, the Justice Department said.

Helix, which Harmon ran from 2014 through 2017, was known as a ""mixer"" or ""tumbler"" of bitcoin. For a fee, Helix would send bitcoin to recipients in a way that hid who was sending that cryptocurrency.

Helix was linked with and associated with a Darknet search called ""Grams,"" which was also run by Harmon, who ""advertised Helix to customers on the Darknet to conceal transactions from law enforcement,"" the Justice Department said.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929924-1629309517996-gettyimages-959428194-bs_4561.jpeg?v=1629309551',)",none
2021-08-19,MarketWatch,"Bitcoin is king of crypto but ‘Ethereum’s ascent to the top of the cryptoverse seems unstoppable,’ says analyst",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-is-king-of-crypto-but-ethereums-ascent-to-the-top-of-the-cryptoverse-seems-unstoppable-says-analyst-11629313818,"Bitcoin, the world’s No. 1 crypto and the genesis of the current revolution in digital assets may one day bow down to a new king of the sector, speculates a researcher.

“Ethereum will continue to outperform Bitcoin in 2021 and will, ultimately, exceed its rival’s value,” wrote Nigel Green, chief executive and founder of deVere Group, a large financial advisory firm and asset manager, in a Wednesday note.

Green makes the case that bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.10% which was launched in a white paper in 2008 may cede its dominance to Ethereum’s Ether ETHUSD, +0.11% , which is viewed by some as boasting a clearer use case than bitcoin which is considered by some as digital gold.

Bitcoin’s value in 2021 is up 57%, while Ether’s has risen 318%, at last check on CoinDesk.

By comparison, traditional assets have seen far more mundane returns. The S&P 500 index SPX has gained more than 18% in the year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA is up 15% thus far in 2021, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP has risen almost 14% and gold futuresGC00 are down almost 6%, FactSet data show.

Bitcoin’s major marketing point has been its claim by enthusiasts to be a store of value and as a currency to a lesser extent, but Ethereum’s network is viewed by many as a powerful, open-source, decentralized backbone off which a number of applications can be based.

Ether, launched in 2015 by a team including Vitarik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, and Gavin Wood, allows software developers to write bespoke programs atop its network. Sometimes these applications are referred to as smart contracts.

Ether bulls make the case that the world’s No. 2 crypto by market cap is the most in-demand development platform, thereby highlighting the Ethereum network’s “value not only as a platform for developers but as a worldwide financial utility,” wrote Green.

Ethereum also serves as the backbone of a number of popular and groundbreaking platforms, including decentralized finance networks, or DeFi, nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, and DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations.

Those growing uses have gummed up Ether’s works but that is seen changing in coming months.

A key upgrade to the Ether network, which includes a phased shift from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake and increased storage capacity and processing power for smart contracts, is under way.

Put simply, a proof-of-work network requires tremendous amounts of computing power to verify the distributed-ledger network, which is the foundation of traditional crypto, while a proof-of-stake requires proof of ownership and is considered more environmentally friendly because it reduces the carbon footprint of verifying transactions on the blockchain and paying out rewards to those “miners” who underpin the network.

The process of investors staking their Ether in preparation for the upgrade to Ethereum also has been credited in buoying prices of the digital asset.

“These upgrades represent a major boost not just for Ethereum but for blockchain technology itself,” writes Green. “Ultimately, this will mean that its value will exceed that of Bitcoin—probably within five years,” he predicts.

Green is hardly the first to speculate that Ether will supplant Ether one day. Industry enthusiasts even have a name for it: the flippening. The flippening is the day that Ethereum overtakes bitcoin in market value.

Still, bitcoin remains the dominant player, representing 44% of the nearly $1.96 trillion in crypto market value compared with Ether’s nearly 19%, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

To be sure, it is impossible to know which, if any, crypto will survive much less become the most dominant. Scrutiny of the sector is intensifying as regulators look to put up guardrails to protect would-be investors and central banks contemplate the use of central bank digital currencies and stablecoins, which could also pose existential threats to the extant array of crypto assets.","('https://images.mktw.net/im-319813/social',)",none
2021-08-19,Mint,India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption in the world,https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/india-ranks-second-in-terms-of-crypto-adoption-in-the-world-11629306088082.html,"NEW DELHI : India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption worldwide behind Vietnam, but ahead of countries such as the US, UK, and China, according to the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

This comes even as worldwide crypto adoption grew by 880% between June 2020 and July 2021, according to the report.

A report by US-based research platform Finder released this month corroborated that the top five countries in terms of crypto adoption were all from Asia.

The company surveyed 47,000 users worldwide and 30% of those surveyed in India said they owned cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the most popular coin in India, followed by Ripple, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash, according to the report.

India’s “huge expatriate population"" makes it the world’s number one remittance recipient in the crypto space, Finder said. India had the largest expatriate population in the world, with 18 million people from the country living outside their homeland last year, noted a January 2021 UN report.

Crypto adoption in India has also been led by smaller towns in the country. The largest crypto exchange in the country by trading volume, WazirX, said last week that it had seen more than 2,648% growth in user sign-ups from tier II and tier III cities in India.

The exchange has a claimed user base of 7.3 million users and said it has clocked more than $21.8 billion in trading volumes this year.

Competitor Coinswitch Kuber, which ranks among the top crypto exchanges in India by trading volumes, noted the same trend. It saw a 135% monthly growth in user sign-ups from smaller towns, which made up 61% of the exchange’s total business. Trading volumes from these cities in the last six months were close to ₹431 billion, said Sharan Nair, chief business officer of the company.

The interest is mostly driven by referrals, said Naimish Sanghvi, who has been running crypto information platform Coin Crunch since 2018. The fact that cryptocurrencies have made money for many individuals almost overnight has drawn more such users to the space, especially from smaller towns, he said. However, serious investors who will get in the space for the long term are yet to really take interest.

2021-08-19,Al Jazeera,Global crypto adoption among retail investors surges 881 percent,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/8/18/global-crypto-adoption-among-retail-investors-surges-881-percent,"The top countries adopting crypto in the past year are Vietnam, India, Pakistan and Ukraine, crypto-analysis firm Chainalysis said.

Global crypto adoption among ordinary investors has surged in the past year, according to crypto-analysis firm Chainalysis.

Using factors like peer-to-peer exchange trading volume and value received, Chainalysis said global crypto adoption has risen by more than 881% in the past year.

While the firm sees professional and institutional markets as crucial, it aimed to highlight the countries with the greatest crypto adoption by retail investors — focusing on use cases related to transactions and individual saving, rather than trading and speculation. The top countries in the ranking are Vietnam, India, Pakistan and Ukraine.

“In emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions,” Chainalysis said in the report, “while adoption in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia over the last year has been powered largely by institutional investment.”

Interest in cryptocurrencies has surged in the past year along with prices. Bitcoin has more than tripled in the past 12 months, while second-biggest crypto Ether is up about sevenfold — and many other top cryptocurrencies have registered strong gains as well.

The firm’s Global Crypto Adoption Index ranked 154 countries by three main metrics. China and the U.S. both dropped in the rankings, primarily because peer-to-peer trading volume declined.

Chainalysis took out one factor it had used in previous analysis: number of deposits by country weighted by number of internet users. However, the firm found that it skewed the rankings toward countries with comparatively more decentralized finance, or DeFi, users. Instead, it’s creating a DeFi Adoption Index that it said will be available in coming weeks.

“Growing transaction volume for centralized services and the explosive growth of DeFi are driving cryptocurrency usage in the developed world and in countries that already had substantial adoption, while P2P platforms are driving new adoption in emerging markets,’ the Chainalysis report said. “Our biggest question for the next 12 months is how much adoption will continue on those platform categories compared to new and emerging models we haven’t seen yet.”","('https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bitcoin.jpg?resize=1200%2C630',)",none

NEW DELHI: Will Argentina become the first major economy to bite the bullet and treat cryptocurrency as legal tender? Well, president Alberto Fernandez is definitely open to the idea.In an interview earlier this week with Black Box, a show hosted by Argentinian journalist Julio Leiva , Fernandez had indicated his willingness when he was asked about the adoption of cryptocurrency as legal tender in Argentina.Fernandez said that following the discussions happening all over the world on the value and use of cryptocurrencies as legal tender, considerable interest has been generated in Argentina too.He added that the issue should be treated carefully, and acknowledged the fact that he had limited knowledge on the subject of cryptocurrencies.“This is a subject that must be treated carefully. In my case, because it (cryptocurrencies) is still unknown to me. Some still don’t understand how this money materialized. These doubts I have, are shared by many. That’s why the project has not expanded further,” Fernandez said in the interview as quoted by portal bitcoin.com.He believes that cryptocurrency could address the country’s inflation problem.His optimism is not without its share of caution though. He admits that crypto is a difficult subject to talk about given that it has been associated with scams in the past.Another country in the South American continent El Salvador has already granted legal tender status to bitcoin.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85429053,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-37391,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

After years of silence, the Dogecoin Foundation is back after six years and its new advisory board includes Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Jared Birchall, who heads Elon Musk’s family office, as advisors.In an announcement yesterday, the Foundation announced its re-establishment with “renewed focus” to support the ecosystem and community built around the cryptocurrency . The Dogecoin Foundation is a non-profit organization that was first launched in 2014 but had been dissolved over time.Max Keller, a core developer for the Dogecoin project, will also serve as a technical adviser, while founder Shibetoshi Nakamoto will be the community and memes advisor.In its announcement, the Foundation said it is not here to “take control” of the Dogecoin Core Wallet project but to accelerate development efforts around the crypto token. The Dogecoin Core Wallet is the official wallet for holding Dogecoin that’s maintained by the foundation.“We are here to accelerate the development effort by supporting current Dogecoin Core and future Dogecoin Developers to work on a full-time basis through sponsorship, as well as providing a welcome landing for new contributors hoping to help with the project,” the foundation said in its announcement.It also hopes to raise a three-year budget, which will be used to hire a staff that will look after its day-to-day activities.While Musk has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin lately, Buterin had famously donated 50% of the supply of Shiba Inu tokens to a crypto covid relief fund in India earlier this year. The developers of the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency had put 50% of the coin’s supply in a public wallet owned by Buterin, and many saw the donation as Buterin’s way of withdrawing support for meme-based cryptos like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin.Further, the Foundation also plans to announce new projects on Dogecoin soon. Its website has space for the project roadmap, which it claims is “being drafted” right now and will be announced “shortly”. “The Dogecoin Foundation is also looking to the future of the broader Dogecoin ecosystem, and in coming weeks, will be announcing new projects that will compliment the current Core Wallet to enable faster integration and easier APIs for Financial, Social and Charitable projects wishing to use Dogecoin,” the announcement said.It’s unclear why the Dogecoin Foundation chose to return at this time, but it could be because the coin has drawn flak from the broader crypto ecosystem. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have often been accused of reducing the overall industry’s credibility since they were both made as joke coins at first. At the moment, Coinmarketcap ranks the token as one of its top cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of nearly $40 billion.The Foundation also announced that it now owns the Dogecoin Logo and mark, and will maintain it for the community, fighting efforts to co-opt the currency. “For many years, the Dogecoin community has continued to think the best of people and hoped that everyone could play nicely with the name and logos. Dogecoin belongs to the people after all,” the foundation said in its post. “However, in recent times, numerous attempts have been made to co-opt the ‘Dogecoin’ brand in various jurisdictions, in ways that would prevent the community and the project itself from using them,” it added.

Concerns about cryptocurrencies were raised Tuesday by Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

""I was more optimistic about crypto and bitcoin five or six years ago,"" said Kashkari. ""So far what I’ve seen is … 95% fraud, hype, noise and confusion.""

Kashkari made the comments during an appearance at the Pacific NorthWest Economic Region annual summit in Big Sky, Montana, and reported by Coindesk.

Kashkari contrasted the open nature of the crypto field with the U.S. government’s monopoly on issuance of dollars.

""There are thousands of these garbage coins that have been created,"" the central banker went on. ""Some of them are complete fraud Ponzi schemes. They dupe people into investing money and then the founders rip them off.""

Kashkari scoffed at the idea that bitcoin could serve as a safe haven from inflation, particularly the kind seen in some developing countries.

2021-08-19,NDTV Gadgets 360,"Cryptocurrency Volatility Doesn’t Scare Big Investors, but Compliance Is Needed: Shark Tank Star Kevin O'Leary",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-investment-kevin-o-leary-shark-tank-mr-wonderful-volatility-compliance-ftx-crypto-2513020,"With so much hype and talk surrounding cryptocurrency, most people wonder why institutions are still wary about the promising new sector? Why only individual investors are flocking to invest in these virtual currencies but not the big players yet? To be fair, some institutions like MicroStrategy and Tesla have already invested in crypto. But most of the big names haven't yet. Shark Tank star and investor Kevin O'Leary said this is because most big investors want “compliance.” The Canadian businessman dismissed the notion that institutional investors are scared of the volatility, saying rather “they want to play.”

In most parts of the world, cryptocurrency has not received regulatory approval but digital coin trading is allowed.

In an interview with CryptoPotato, O'Leary — popularly known as ""Mr Wonderful"" from the reality TV series — said, “It's one thing to put a small amount of money to work but when you start talking about a 10 percent allocation of a large pool of capital, you need to integrate that with your compliance system and your accounting system, and your external reporting system.”

O'Leary recently bought a stake in FTX crypto exchange and signed a multi-year deal to become its ambassador and spokesperson. He will be paid in cryptocurrency. He said he is a “test case” for institutions to see whether they should join the rapidly evolving market. Previously, he said he has solved his compliance problems with cryptocurrencies.

Finally solved my compliance problems with #cryptocurrencies I'm going to use FTX to increase my allocation and use the platform to manage my portfolios https://t.co/yaoRUnXy14 — Kevin O'Leary aka Mr. Wonderful (@kevinolearytv) August 10, 2021

In February this year, O'Leary told Bitcoin.com that he has invested 3 percent of his portfolio in Bitcoin and Ether, the two most popular crypto coins.

But “Mr Wonderful” was not always excited about cryptocurrency. Although he owned some Ethereum and Bitcoin personally in 2017, the millionaire investor said he remained outside the cryptocurrency business for long because of the regulatory environment.

Now he is investing in it because the “facts” have changed. “When facts change, I change. I'm a pragmatic investor, I allocate capital along a wide range of asset classes.” He said most of the big, institutional investors are in the Bitcoin business because they see it as a property. O'Leary also said he doesn't think any other cryptocurrency will overtake Bitcoin in terms of market dominance.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/kevin_o_leary_shark_tank_abc_1629274618398.jpg',)",none

Profit booking activity spiked during the past 24 hours, leading to significant value erosion.

Bitcoin, which was inching closer to $48,000 a couple of days ago, has now fallen to $45,000. It was down over 1.4 per cent at 1 pm today. The market capitalisation of Bitcoin has fallen to $848 billion, down over 32 billion from Tuesday.

Ether, the second-most popular cryptocurrency in the world, also fell by 3 per cent and was trading at just over $3,000. Ether’s market capitalisation has dipped to $357 billion.

All other altcoins including XRP, Cardano, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Polkadot and Uniswap also fell sharply in the range of 2-9 per cent.

Traders should proceed with caution as the cryptocurrency market is likely to be under pressure for the next 24 hours.

Commenting on the virtual coin market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The past 24 hours were yet another profit booking session. Most of the other Altcoins shed off their gains from the past few days.”

“BTC investors would be on their edge as BTC has again dropped below the psychological level of $45,000. This drop has led to the addition of several new short positions dragging the markets even lower,” he added.

“We can expect the markets to remain under pressure over the coming 24 hours.”

""We cannot be moving ahead as if this doesn't exist. We are not saying no to cryptocurrency. We are saying we will have to see how this technology can help fintech to maximise the potential it has. But how sophisticated regulation can be is something which I want to work with the RBI,"" she told the newspaper.

The finance minister also said that the work was nearly complete and the cabinet had to decide on it now.

Asked about the privatisation of BPCL and Air India, Sitharaman said she was optimistic that the process would be completed by 2021-end.

""When the government lets go of its ownership, there is far more due diligence that has to be adhered to. There is the complete unglamorous backroom work. You will feel probably it is not happening.

The price of Bitcoin stood at $44,950.92 at the time of this article. On the other hand, the dominance of Bitcoin in the market was 44.36 per cent, which was an increase of 0.71 per cent over the day. It should be noted that it was not only Bitcoin that was trading in the red. The overall crypto market was trading red over the past 24 hours according to data gathered from CoinMarketCap.

Other major coins such as Ethereum and Binance were also trading red. Ether, on Wednesday, showed a price of $3,026.00 which was 5.65 per cent lower over the past 24 hours. The drop over the course of the past seven days was listed as 4.03 per cent as per information on CoinMarketCap.

However, the price overall was trading green over the course of the last week at 12.58 per cent.

Speaking on the performance of Bitcoin, Ether and Dogecoin, Edul Patel, the CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex said, “It was yet another choppy session for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin got dragged down by the bears in the past 24 hours, as we noticed a huge number of short positions opening up. After the recent rally, the largest crypto by market cap has been tightly range-bound. The largest Altcoin by market capitalization, Ether too faced a similar sell-off.""

Patel added, “Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency developed initially as a meme coin, witnessed quite a roller coaster ride over the past 24 hours. DOGE was the third-highest traded coin over after Bitcoin and Ethereum. Since the bears appeared to have the upper hand on DOGE, it could indicate that the meme coin would likely remain under pressure throughout the week. Some of the Altcoins like MATIC and Solana still had a pretty decent trading session. These are definitely exciting times for the altcoins, as the blue chips in crypto are consolidating.""

The global crypto market cap was listed as $1.90 trillion, which was a 4.95 per cent decline over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours was $126.78 billion which made for a 4.08 per cent increase. The total DeFi volume was $17.52 billion or 13.82 per cent of the total crypto market’s 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins was standing at $101.37 billion, which was 79.96 per cent of the total crypto market volume of the last 24 hours.

Siddharth Menon the COO of WazirX said, “The Altcoin market has broken out of the rectangle pattern after 3 months of consolidation. Upmove till $1.45 Trillion is expected after the breakout, Solana has entered into top 10 ranking by touching new ATH (All Time High). These are some strong signals of the Bull market where these Alts make new highs ahead of Bitcoin and Ether. Cardano is short of 10% from its previous ATH.”

“Markets are offering favourable risk:reward at this stage. One should always trade or invest with caution in crypto markets as it is a highly volatile market. Risk should be given top priority over reward while you approach any market,” Menon added.

However, depending on your financial situation and appetite for investing risk, crypto might not be an appropriate investment for you right now - or ever.""I am the biggest crypto hippie you'll talk to in a very long time,"" says Tyrone Ross, CEO of Onramp Invest, a cryptoasset platform for registered investment advisors . And yet, he cautions against it. ""I don't think the general public should be investing in crypto.""Picture your finances as an ice cream sundae, with crypto as the cherry on top. It makes up a small proportion of the overall sundae, and not everyone wants one. And before you fish that cherry out of the jar, you need to assemble the rest of your dessert. In non-ice-cream terms, that means creating a strong financial foundation and learning everything you can about crypto before you put any real money in.First and foremost, you need to prepare for those times when things don't go as planned.Over the past year, workers who lost income because of the pandemic had to tinto savings, take on debt or enter into hardship programs to afford their bills. This time has been a stark reminder of the importance of having an emergency fund.""When you're young, you can feel like Superman or Superwoman, but when the bubble happens, you could easily be out of a job for nine to 12 months,"" says Theresa Morrison, a financial planner in Tucson, Arizona. ""Don't underestimate systemic shocks to the market.""Morrison recommends saving up six months of living expenses if you're single, or around three months if you share expenses with a working spouse or partner. But stashing away even a few hundred dollars can be helpful when you're faced with an unexpected expense . And if you have any high-interest debt, like credit card debt, paying this down can further strengthen your financial position.Review your insurance coverage, too, because these policies can provide much-needed money during difficult times. Life insurance can be especially important if you have dependents.Once you have money set aside for emergencies, begin thinking about your short-, medium- and long-term financial goals. Retirement is, of course, a big thing to save for, so contribute to retirement accounts (especially if you have access to a plan with an employer match). But set specific savings goals for other major life steps.""Most people want to travel every year, buy a house in 10 years, get married in 10 years. These things cost money,"" Morrison says. ""Put down how much it'll cost in today's terms and figure out how much to save out of your paycheck every month. From my experience, that alone can be $1,000 a month.""You've got the money and you're ready to jump on the crypto bandwagon, only you have no idea how someone even buys crypto. Or how it will fit into your overall financial plan. Or if it's too risky for you.Time out. Don't do anything with your money that you don't understand. Dedicate some time to learning everything you can about crypto. Understanding the mechanics is important, but so is learning what kind of investor you are, because that also affects the kinds of investments that would be a good fit for you.""There's a process you have to go through to determine if this new asset class is right for you. What's your plan? How old are you? What are your goals? How tech-savvy are you? Do you understand what it means to hold these assets and have them not be insured? If something happens to you, who in your family knows about this stuff to retrieve it?"" Ross says. ""People don't do the right due diligence before dumping money into something. I know that's not the sexy answer, but it's the truth.""Once you have a grasp on how it all works, you can begin to think about allocating some of your excess cash (after you pay your bills and meet your monthly savings goals) toward crypto. But keep your investment totals small and manageable. Ross recommends investing up to $500 or so. This way, even if you lose it all, it's an amount you specifically budgeted.""If you invest in crypto, think of it as dead money. Money you'll never get back,"" says Danny Lee, a financial planner in Denver. ""At the end of the day, it's going to be a speculative investment.""","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85420791,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76298,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-19,News18,EXPLAINED: Why Best Thing About Cryptocurrency May Be The Blockchain Tech That Anchors It,https://www.news18.com/news/explainers/explained-why-the-best-thing-about-cryptocurrency-may-be-the-blockchain-tech-that-anchors-it-4098050.html,"Many of us have increasingly become used to making transactions using digital wallets and online payment systems. We are also exhorted to never share our PIN numbers and passwords to prevent hackers and fraudsters from breaking into out account and stealing money. So, while the transactions are digital, the fears are pretty analog, akin to having our pocket picked or property burgled. Such worries though are largely non-existent in the world of cryptocurrency for all the talk of the unsavoury ways in which they are used. That is because of the blockchain technology underlying cryptocurrencies, which ensure that it is terribly difficult to tamper with records or get away with unauthorised transactions.

What Is The Blockchain?

It’s a combination of two words ‘block’ and ‘chain’, and the meaning is quite direct. To begin with, what you need to know is that Bitcoin — the earliest and the most valuable cryptocurrency — records transactions in tranches known as ‘blocks’, and then adds such one block to another in a continuing ‘chain’ of all transactions. Much like a ledger or an account book, where entries are listed one below the other. Except that here there is no single person who records the entries but everybody who owns the cryptocurrency gets to play an active role in the upkeep and fidelity of the account book.

Why Was The Blockchain Created?

Any cryptocurrency is a digital token. That is, say you own 10 Bitcoins, you don’t actually hold them in your hands. Your crypto assets will exist as lines of code on a computer and any transaction you make will have to be digitally executed and verified.

Now, to have a purely digital currency, which exists only as code, can be more complicated than physical money. That is because with physical money, if you have a Rs 10 note and you gave it to a shopkeeper to buy a pen, you will not be able to use the same note again because you have lost, or exchanged, custody of the Rs 10 note for the item you bought. However, with a digital currency there is a problem that the same line of code, which represents a set monetary value, can be sent to multiple people. How would they know that one hasn’t already spent the money that is being offered afresh?

You can point out that when we spend money online, even if the transaction is digital, we do not manage to spend the same funds twice. That is because, the wallet or account that is being used for online transactions is monitored by a third-party — the bank or the payment service provider — which keeps tabs on how much money you hold in the account and how much you have spent.

But Bitcoin, and the other cryptocurrencies that have followed in its wake, were created to be decentralised currencies, that is, ones that wouldn’t need a bank or a third-party monitor to verify transactions. The blockchain, then, was the key tech proposed by the creator, or creators, of Bitcoin to solve the problem of not having a central authority to oversee transactions.

How Does The Blockchain Work?

In a 2008 white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or group of people who led the creation of Bitcoin, said, “We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.""

That, in a nutshell, is the basic idea behind blockchain with, of course, a statement of the other technicalities that go into making the system a robust online account book. Since there is no central authotrity keeping a tab on transactions, the blockchain is said to represent what is called a “decentralised ledger"".

The creators of Bitcoin had noted that to remove the role of a trusted third-party, “what is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other"". But there was the ‘double-spend’ problem and, to counter it, the creators proposed “a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions"". Sounds like complicated code, but what it lays out is the philosophy of the blockchain.

The Bitcoin paper assumes, simply enough, that to be able to detect any case of ‘double-spend’, a user must be aware of any previous transactions made with the same coin, or code, since it’s digital money we’re talking about.

“The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions… To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced, and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received,"" the paper said. Accomplish this and, voila, you have your peer-to-peer, decentralised, and secure, cryptocurrency.

How Does Bitcoin Use Its Blockchain?

So, first, when a transaction is made using Bitcoin, it is broadcast to all the nodes, which is nothing but Bitcoin parlance for any computer that any user uses to access her Bitcoins. What happens after the details of a transaction is shared with all the nodes is that each node bunches them into a block. So far so good. But what prevents a node to broadcast a fraudulent transaction and getting it uploaded? To counter this, Bitcoin has an elaborate ‘proof-of-work"" and ‘consensus’ mechanism.

What ‘proof-of-work’ involves is the nodes getting down to solving a complex algorithm — once a block has been created — that would generate a key to add the transaction to the chain of all preceding transactions. But solving the algorithm is a task that requires massive computational power, something that yields Bitcoin — the so-called mining — and also ensures the integrity and security of the distributed ledger.

“When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes. Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent,"" the Bitcoin paper says, describing how a block is added to the chain. Now comes the part about why it’s so tough to tamper with the Bitcoin ledger.

Since the nodes in the Bitcoin system have to accept the transactions in a block, there is a majority decision system involved here. That is, 51 per cent of all the computing power in the Bitcoin network would have to okay a block for it to be added to the blockchain. The Bitcoin paper says that “the majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it"".

“If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes,"" given the computational power required to verify and add one block, this is something that Bitcoin users believe can never happen.

Unless, one group controls 51 per cent of the computational power. Then it can force the other users to accept whatever transactions it clears. But the Bitcoin paper notes that transactions will be “computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power"".

What Other Uses Can It Have?

From maintaining databases of land records to facilitating voting at elections, the use of blockchain tech is being explored in multiple sectors. IBM is said to have devised a logistics tracker for food based on blockchain while the tech is being developed for sectors like banking, healthcare, etc. “Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved,"" IBM says. Within the crypto-verse itself, the blockchain is now used to also support the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a new digital asset category that allows users to digitally mint artwork, etc. and trade those as signature property.

Coming back to real-world uses, tampering of documents and records and vote manipulation are issues that a blockchain-based system can address given that there is no central authority or central database that manipulators can hack.

In its draft ‘National Strategy on Blockchain‘, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) said that blockchain is “an apt technology for applying to resolve shortcomings of any property record management system. Immutability in Blockchain can provide an assurance to citizens that their property records are never tampered"".

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has also reportedly directed the setting up of a blockchain system to track aspects related to the stock market.

But that’s not to say that the blockchain does not have its drawbacks, the chief among which is the huge requirement of energy to run the system. The cracking of the algorithm that enables the addition of a block to the chain requires users to devote massive computational power. When it comes to Bitcoin, the spending of so much energy is rewarded with the cryptocurrency, but it is one aspect of the system that has been flagged as not being environmentally sustainable.

This Dutch family stores crypto assets in vaults across 4 continents after betting all their money in 2017



After going all-in on Bitcoin, a Dutch family has now revealed that they store all their cryptocurrency assets in secret vaults in four continents. The family comprising Didi Taihuttu, his wife, and three kids, liquidated all their assets to purchase bitcoin in 2017 when it was trading at around $900. Patriarch Taihuttu told CNBC that the family had hidden cryptocurrency assets in two spots in Europe, another two in Asia, one in South America, and a sixth in Australia. Read details here.

Digital assets investment products saw sixth straight week of outflows, thus bringing total redemptions to $115 million during the six-week period, the longest losing streak since January 2018, according to a report by digital asset manager CoinShares.

Investors took out a net of $22.1 million from cryptocurrency funds last week, even as bitcoin gained from a low of $42,924 to a high of $47,831. The funds based on the world’s biggest cryptocurrency saw the biggest outflows at $22 million, followed by $1.1 million outflows from ether, data showed.

As per the digital asset manager, sentiment looks to be recovering in the overall crypto market judging by recent price rises, which has pushed total investment product assets under management (AUM) to $55 billion, rising 10% week-on-week.

CoinShares, which is the world’s second-biggest digital-asset manager with an AUM of around $4.5 billion, saw outflows of around $16 million during the week. The world’s biggest digital asset manager, Grayscale, saw inflows of around $0.3 million.

2021-08-19,The Economic Times,Beyond Bitcoins: Investors make big bets in altcoins,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/beyond-bitcoins-investors-make-big-bets-in-altcoins/articleshow/85398742.cms,"Cryptocurrencies have made a sharp comeback, with top-notch tokens leading the way. However, alternative coins have outperformed leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past one week, thanks to a catch-up rally.Edul Patel, CEO & co-founder, Mudrex , said the rally in altcoins has reduced the dominance of Bitcoin, whose market cap was now at 45 per cent of the total crypto market cap. “If we look at an indicator called the Money Flow Index, we see that the volume and money flow into most of the top altcoins has gone significantly up. It is because of the growth potential of these smaller altcoins.”After the London Hard Fork update, there was a rally in Bitcoin and Ethereum, leading to a breakout for the entire market following a prolonged consolidation. The major digital currencies have gained 9-12 per cent in the past week.On the other hand, altcoins such as IoTeX have rallied over 320 per cent in the last seven days. Revain and Terra have soared 78 per cent and 62 per cent, respectively. Among the popular names, Solana, Axie Infinity, Cadano, XRP and Dogecoin have jumped 40-65 per cent during the period.Sharan Nair, Chief Business Officer at CoinSwitch Kuber , said cryptocurrencies were still at a nascent stage. There was still a huge potential for new entrant coins to make an impact. ""Most investors are on the lookout for new coins that they believe will radically change the ecosystem and they want to invest in them at early stages and benefit from it, like what investors did in bitcoin and ether,"" he added.Investors who flock to cryptocurrencies for attractive returns said crypto behemoths like Bitcoin and Ethereum do not have much steam left. This has made many altcoins scale higher in the market cap chart. ""Adoption leads to demand, which drives prices significantly higher,"" said Patel. ""In the coming months, we would see these smaller altcoins gain adoption as well as market capitalisation.""For example, Binance Coin and Cardano are now the third and fourth largest cryptocurrencies, respectively. Similarly, Solana is now on the verge of entering the top 10 table. Axie Infinity has joined the top 35. ""The market seems to be bullish and, in general, we have seen such a market bringing in new crypto investors, many of whom try to invest more in new coins,"" said Nair.Market watchers said investors were now more inclined towards altcoins, instead of mainstream tokens, as they were aiming to make an early entry into new crypto projects with promise and potential. “The new projects are undervalued and once its potential is exposed, it will draw a lot of traction and will lead to an increase in price,” Nair of CoinSwitchKuber said.Analysts suggested that investors were not willing to put all their eggs in one basket. Prudent investors prefer to diversify their portfolios.Several retail investors come to the crypto markets to make quick gains and only invest in the smaller altcoins, many of which often nosedive.Some of the smaller altcoins have exciting prospects as they gain adoption from institutional investors and retail investors, said Patel. ""The bulk of the investments would still flow into the mainstream tokens instead of smaller altcoins,"" he added.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85399014,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-67542,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-19,Politico,‘Massive wake-up call’: Crypto faces growing legal crackdown,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/17/cryptocurrency-legal-crackdown-505595,"""This should serve as a massive wake-up call to the crypto industry,"" said Charley Cooper, a former CFTC chief operating officer now with software and blockchain technology firm R3. ""A policy or a posture of ignoring Washington or showing disdain for Washington ... will ultimately be a failed strategy.""

The enforcement actions are fueling debate about how cryptocurrency players fit into financial regulations. Federal regulators say the new digital currency platforms must adhere to existing rules, but industry players counter that it's not that simple and that it's time for Congress to pass new laws that are more tailored to crypto.

""This regulation by enforcement that we're seeing is not the way to go because it doesn't create good policy,"" said Kristin Smith, who advocates for the cryptocurrency industry as executive director of the Blockchain Association. ""Regulators — in particular the SEC — think that the laws and regulations are crystal clear and that they're very easy to interpret. But for those of us on the other side of the table that are working in the industry and its ecosystem, the laws aren't clear, and it's very difficult to figure out how to apply them.""

The market value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies hit $2 trillion again this week, meaning the stakes have never been higher for companies looking to enter the space. The movement has also spawned a whole sector of decentralized finance applications — so-called DeFi apps — that offer automated, autonomous trading and lending services with minimal human interaction. One such DeFi service, Poly Network, disclosed losing $600 million in a breach earlier this month.

Regulators in recent weeks have made clear they’re zeroing in on crypto exchanges and DeFi platforms.

Two high profile cases in August — a $100 million CFTC and Treasury settlement with crypto derivatives service BitMEX and a $10 million SEC settlement with digital asset exchange Poloniex — revolved around charges that the companies were operating unlicensed trading platforms. Another SEC settlement this month with decentralized lender DeFi Money Market accused its backers of selling more than $30 million in unregistered securities using so-called smart contracts and DeFi technology.

Some of the targeted crypto companies are trying to signal that they now take the rules more seriously. BitMEX CEO Alexander Höptner said in a blog post after his exchange's settlement that ""crypto is becoming more responsible.""

""We are committed to becoming a regulated exchange and are looking to set the benchmarks in this new era for crypto,"" said George Godsal, spokesperson for BitMEX operator 100x.

The federal cases came as five states including New Jersey, Texas and Kentucky took action against the startup BlockFi for offering interest-earning accounts that regulators say could be unregistered securities products.

BlockFi spokesperson Madelyn McHugh said the company believes its products and services are lawful and appropriate for crypto market participants, and that ""we remain steadfast in our commitment to protect consumers’ rights to earn interest on their crypto assets.""

""We’re hopeful that BlockFi will lead the charge in collaborating with regulators to define a regulatory path for our ecosystem going forward,"" McHugh said.

Lawyers tracking the cases said they showed that, even though some digital assets businesses assert certain laws don't apply to them, that doesn't stop the government from taking action.

""We've all been telling our clients and we've been telling people publicly for years that just because you come up with some name for something doesn't mean that the laws don't apply,"" said Stephen Palley, partner at the law firm Anderson Kill.

Vincent McGonagle, the CFTC's acting enforcement director, said in a statement that ""there is a strong need for regulatory compliance in the digital asset market space and for bad actors to be identified and held accountable.""

""The CFTC will continue to use the tools available to us to the fullest extent possible to closely monitor these evolving markets,"" McGonagle said. ""The recent resolution with BitMEX and other enforcement actions by the commission, including those in the spot markets for digital assets, reflect our strong commitment to aggressively pursue actionable conduct within our jurisdiction.""

Davis Polk partner Robert Cohen, former chief of the SEC's cyber unit, said that agency has taken an active approach to crypto enforcement since 2017, and it's no surprise it's continued under the Biden administration.

One of Trump-era SEC Chair Jay Clayton's final actions at the helm of the agency last December was to sue financial technology startup Ripple for allegedly selling unregistered securities in the form of the XRP cryptocurrency. The move triggered litigation between the SEC and Ripple that continues to this day over the extent to which digital currency should be regulated as an investment product.

""A question going forward is whether there will be progress on rulemaking and guidance for the community that provides the clarity and certainty needed to operate within the SEC’s regulatory system,"" Cohen said.

Some lawmakers are beginning to push back on the enforcement crackdown and warn there is an urgent need for Congress to draft new rules for the industry's business model.

Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, said ""regulation through enforcement hinders innovation.""

""It's creating uncertainty in a really important and growing industry in the United States and globally,” McHenry said in an interview. “If we don't bring regulatory clarity here in this space, it's going to go to other regimes around the world that are more conducive for its development.""

Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) has introduced legislation that would require the CFTC and SEC to issue new cryptocurrency rules. His bill would give the CFTC — which today regulates derivatives linked to things like oil and also fiat currencies — authority over digital assets. It would give the SEC — the U.S. stock market regulator — authority over digital asset securities.

McHenry has also proposed a bill that would convene a working group between the SEC, CFTC and industry to report on cryptocurrency regulation.

""The lack of legal clarity has hindered investment and innovation, and Congress should provide clear rules of the road for this growing market,"" Beyer said in a statement.

Gensler, who has been leading efforts to rein in crypto as SEC chair, said this month that his agency needs additional authorities to prevent transactions, products and platforms from falling between the regulatory cracks.

""Right now we are turning to the courts to settle our disputes, which is not necessarily a bad thing — that's why they're there,"" said Joseph Rotunda, director of the enforcement division at the Texas State Securities Board. ""But that also provides a lack of certainty.""","('https://static.politico.com/9a/89/4daef56d44839198f6d3288dc110/210817-cryptocurrency-wallet-ap-773.jpg',)",none

The entire cryptocurrency market climbed to more than $2 trillion over the weekend for the first time since mid-May. Bitcoin, one of the more popular digital offerings, also surged to more than $48,000, though it has already lost some of those gains. If you're like many investors, you may be wondering how you can get in on the action. That could include your retirement savings vehicles, such as individual retirement accounts.

Crypto is a 24/7, 365 market, so you can't just leave it to chance like every other asset. Tyrone Ross Jr. CEO of Onramp Invest

But both bullish and bearish experts on cryptocurrencies say it's still too early to store those assets in retirement accounts. Tyrone Ross Jr., CEO of Onramp Invest, a provider of a crypto asset integration platform for financial advisors, is one of them. That's despite admitting he owns a ""whole lot"" of cryptocurrencies in his own portfolio. Ross compares using cryptocurrencies in a retirement account to taking a beautiful, exotic animal outside of its natural habitat and putting it in a zoo. Instead, it should be free, open and borderless, he said.

""As you start to understand it and all the things you can do with it, you would not put it in some of those accounts,"" Ross said. One reason: Because of how the accounts are structured, the average investor will not be able to hold the keys to their cryptocurrency investment, which is essential for managing their money. Without that, it's just buy and hold, Ross said. Efforts are underway to eliminate that, he said. Still, other concerns are keeping experts from wholeheartedly recommending cryptocurrencies for retirement accounts.

More vigilance

Meanwhile, financial advisors who work with clients who want to add cryptocurrencies to their accounts need to make sure clients are prepared to take on the higher risks associated with those investments. They also need to be prepared to update clients on those investments more frequently than once per quarter as with other holdings such as stocks and bonds. ""You should be talking to clients every month about their crypto,"" Ross said. Investors who instead turn to so-called self-directed IRAs can add those investments without an advisor's help. Yet that will still require more vigilance. ""Crypto is a 24/7, 365 market, so you can't just leave it to chance like every other asset,"" Ross said.

Regulatory risks

Traditional IRA custodians do not currently permit cryptocurrencies in their IRAs. However, self-directed IRAs can. And with that freedom comes risks. ""These self-directed IRA custodians will put in anything you want that's legal, but they're not the police,"" said Ed Slott, CPA and founder of Ed Slott and Co. ""They're not going to tell you what's good or bad or advise."" Currently, these asset classes are not permitted in IRAs: life insurance and collectibles. Part of the problem with those items is the valuations are subjective, such as with a piece of art work.

Other investments that have been cleared for IRAs, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, have a stated market value, Slott said. The known value is important because those assets are taxed when taken out of an IRA. But with cryptocurrencies, the expected value is not clear, Slott said. What makes cryptocurrencies difficult to use is that they are not a regulated product at this point, said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. Meanwhile, IRA accounts tend to be among the most highly regulated, which is why many IRA account administrators will not allow clients to put cryptocurrencies in their accounts, he said. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler recently said the agency needs Congress to increase its ability to oversee cryptocurrencies. In the meantime, the lack of regulation can pose a problem for advisors. ""If you're working with a client and all of a sudden this goes vamoose, what do you say?"" Ross said.

When deciding where to put your money, one thing to remember is the purpose of the account you're using to invest, Kinahan said. For IRAs, typically that purpose is not to lose money. ""Particularly when it comes to your retirement, you want to make sure that the money you sweat out to earn is at that same level or hopefully significantly higher when you retire,"" Kinahan said. As such, separate margin or trading accounts that are not dedicated to retirement may be a better place to add riskier assets. If you still are convinced you want cryptocurrencies in your IRA, limit your exposure to 5%, Slott said. ""You get a taste of it in there,"" Slott said. ""If it goes up, that's great. ""If you lose your money, it's not the worst thing in the world, because it's a very small percentage of your retirement portfolio.""

Headed by the secretary(economic affairs), a high-level committee has been formed and it has already submitted its report on cryptocurrency.

The inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Economic Affairs) to study the issues related to virtual currencies and propose specific actions has already submitted its report.

It has recommended that all private cryptocurrencies, except any virtual currencies issued by state, will be prohibited in India.

""Cabinet note is ready on cryptocurrency (Bill). I am awaiting Cabinet to clear that,"" she said during her interaction with the media here.

Meanwhile, the RBI has concerns on the cryptocurrencies traded in the market and has conveyed the same to the government.

Back in May this year, the finance minister had said that a very calibrated position is supposed to be taken on crypto and digital currency as the world is rapidly transitioning towards technology. Other media reports suggested that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be allowed as an asset class in India.

Underlining that both the government and the RBI are ""committed to financial stability"", RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said there are no differences between the central bank and the Finance Ministry on the matter, and ""we should now await the final decision on the matter"" from the Centre.

Das had said he has ""reasons to believe"" that the government is in agreement with the ""major concerns"" flagged by the RBI about the cryptocurrencies.

The Supreme Court in March allowed banks and financial institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrencies by setting aside the RBI's 2018 circular which had prohibited them.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of their units and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

A three-judge bench, headed by Justice R F Nariman, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular is liable to be set aside on the ground of ""proportionality"".

""Accordingly, the writ petitions are allowed and the circular dated April 6, 2018 is set aside,"" said the bench, also comprising justices Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian.","('https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2021/08/17/961680-crypto-1.jpg',)",none

Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto via Getty Images

The cryptocurrency platform targeted in a massive heist is now inviting the hacker behind it to become an advisor to the firm, and promising a $500,000 reward for the restoration of user funds. Poly Network, a so-called decentralized finance or ""DeFi"" project, was hit with a major attack last week which saw the hacker, or hackers, make off with more than $600 million worth of tokens. Poly Network lets users swap tokens from one digital ledger to another. Someone exploited a flaw in Poly Network's code which allowed them to transfer the assets to their own crypto wallets. It is thought to be the largest crypto heist of all time, surpassing the $534.8 million in digital coins stolen from Japanese exchange Coincheck in a 2018 attack and the estimated $450 million worth of bitcoin that went missing from Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox in 2014. In Poly Network's case, the hacker has taken the unusual step of returning most of the stolen money. All but $33 million of the crypto has now been returned.

However, more than $200 million of the funds is currently locked in an account that requires passwords from Poly Network and the hacker to gain access. Poly Network has pleaded with the hacker, who it is calling ""Mr. White Hat,"" to provide the password — known as a ""private key"" — necessary to retrieve the money. ""Mr. White Hat"" is a reference to ethical hackers who search for vulnerabilities in organizations' systems that could expose them to attacks. Security researchers have questioned the labeling of the Poly Network attacker as a white hat hacker. It's not clear why the hacker is withholding access to the final tranche of assets. An anonymous person claiming to be the hacker has simply said they will provide the key once ""everyone is ready."" Last week, it was revealed that Poly Network had offered a $500,000 ""bug bounty"" to send all of the money back. Such bounties are typically rewarded to people who report bugs to help companies find and resolve flaws before they are disclosed to the general public. The hacker initially turned down the bounty offer. However, in a message embedded in a digital currency transaction Monday, the hacker said ""I am considering taking the bounty as a bonus for public hackers if they can hack the Poly Network.""

Poly Network said Tuesday that it hoped to implement a ""significant system upgrade"" to prevent such an attack from happening again in future, but that it couldn't do so until all the remaining assets are returned. The group said its promise to reward ""Mr. White Hat"" with a $500,000 bounty still stands, and even invited the hacker to becomes its ""chief security advisor.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106926569-1628840500054-gettyimages-1234636357-porzycki-polynetw210812_npiTb.jpeg?v=1628840629',)",none

His tweet comes after the billionaire entrepreneur, Shark Tank star, and the owner of Dallas Mavericks Mark Cuban called the meme coin the strongest medium of exchange in the cryptocurrency world. Cuban has been known as a fan of Dogecoin and he often shows his support on Twitter. But nothing can surpass the Tesla and SpaceX CEO's enthusiasm for the virtual currency. Musk agreed with Cuban's views. Replying to CNBC's tweet stating, ""Mark Cuban says Dogecoin is the 'strongest' cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange,"" Musk tweeted, ""I've been saying this for a while."" His point is made. No one can deter Mr. Musk anymore.

Musk's tweet has received over 26,000 likes and 4,000 retweets within four days. Policy strategist and entrepreneur Erich Reimer replied to him with just one word, Should we take it as his support for Dogecoin? Perhaps we should.

Dogecoin supporters seem to have been torn about the decision to support or shun the cryptocurrency lately. A lot of them have been quite distressed about its performance — and that of the cryptocurrency market — over the last many weeks. As it still continues to go through a low phase, supporters often muse over the future implications of their investments. However, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO continues to actively support it with tweets and memes — not to forget his SNL appearance as 'Dogefather'.

2021-08-19,Business Standard,Cardano's ADA token is now world's third-largest cryptocurrency,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/cardano-s-ada-token-is-now-world-s-third-largest-cryptocurrency-121081700976_1.html,"A little-known digital token linked to the Cardano blockchain has just become the third-largest virtual currency in the world as network developers look to ride the boom in decentralized finance.

With the so-called ADA jumping around 50% over the past week alone, optimism is rising that new technological enhancements will allow smart contracts on Cardano by its announced goal of Sept. 12. That will enable its network to offer lucrative services like DeFi, where Ethereum currently dominates.

In a rally met with skepticism by some big industry names, the ADA token now has a market value of more than $69 billion -- bigger than all rivals except and Ether, according to tracker CoinGecko.

“The Cardano aficionados have been awaiting -- some impatiently -- for what seems like an eternity for some news on smart contracts,” said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner and co-founder of crypto lender Nexo. “Cardano is tussling with no. 2 crypto Ethereum to be the preeminent blockchain offering smart contracts.”

The more than 1,400% jump in ADA over the past year exceeds the returns from both and Ether.

The virtual coin has climbed despite skepticism about its utility from some prominent commentators. For instance, Galaxy Digital LP Chief Executive Officer Mike Novogratz posted on Twitter on Sunday that “I spoke to twenty of the smartest people I know in the space, and zero of them saw Cardano having traction” with developers.





“Most people outside crypto have never even heard of Cardano -- yet here it is with a market cap” that tops many S&P 500 index constituents, Trenchev said.

Decentralized finance -- or DeFi -- ports financial functions onto digital ledgers, allowing people to do things like lend or borrow funds and earn interest in a savings-like account without the need for traditional intermediaries such as banks. Its growing popularity is part of a wider trend of increased blockchain usage.

Recent rallies in Bitcoin, Ether, ADA and other tokens helped the market vault past $2 trillion in value over the weekend for the first time since May, when the famously volatile sector succumbed to a rout.","('https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2021-08/17/full/1629200640-3825.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrency prices have fallen over the past 24 hours as the virtual coin market saw minor consolidation. Almost all cryptocurrencies have seen a fall in prices as the ongoing rally seems to be fading.

Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, was hovering around $46,000, down over 1.2 per cent at 4:30 pm. Bitcoin’s market capitalisation also fell marginally to $880 billion.

Ether price also fell over 1.4 per cent to $3,244. The second most popular cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation fell to $379 billion.

The value of most other altcoins fell including XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Stellar, Uniswap, Chainlink and Litecoin. Only Solana performed well, rising approximately 14 per cent.

Commenting on the consolidation, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The past 24 hours witnessed Bitcoin and Ether toying with their crucial support and resistance levels. BTC hovered around the $46,000 level, and Ether fell below $3200 before settling.”

“Following this, we saw the crypto markets facing a minor consolidation. Among the Altcoins, the star performer of the day was Solana which shot up another 14 per cent,” he added.

“As the top cryptos are losing the steam and consolidating, we might witness another season for the Altcoins after the rally earlier this year.”

India is racing to keep up with the cryptocurrency craze in the country. India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated that the new regulations around cryptocurrencies in India — the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019 — are waiting on approval from the Cabinet before it can be introduced into the Parliament. She had stated this earlier as well, ahead of the Monsoon Session in July this year.The Union Cabinet is India’s highest decision-making body. Only the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and other ministers of rank are a part of the Cabinet. The supreme body needs to give the green light before the new laws can be introduced for debate in Parliament.Those in the know, requesting to remain anonymous, told Business Insider that the government is most likely mulling over a softer stance given the recent surge in crypto adoption and awareness within the country.This means that it's possible that the Cabinet will not approve the bill in its current form, as seen in the draft ahead of the Budget Session of Parliament in February.The massive surge in Bitcoin’s price earlier this year, coupled with high inflation , has led young investors to invest in cryptocurrencies as an alternative financial instrument, despite their reputation for being heavily volatile.This is partly due toexchanges like WazirX, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber, and others garnering new funding. And that funding is going towards heavy-weight sponsorships in the mainstream — like the Euro Cup and the T20 cricket tournament between Sri Lanka and India — which is driving awareness among the masses.If the bill is rejected by the Cabinet, then it’s possible that things will have to start from scratch all over again, especially if the Indian government is looking to take a softer approach to cryptocurrencies.“The government seems to be still in the process of determining the way forward, which may through either an existing committee or a new one with industry consultation where required,"" Rameesh Kailasam, the CEO of IndiaTech, told Business Insider in an earlier interview The way the passing of a bill works in India is that a committee is assigned to draft the bill. The committee is headed by one, or in this case, multiple ministries.Given the vast application of cryptocurrencies — even though the Ministry of Finance’s Department of Economic Affairs is leading the charge — other stakeholders like the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and the Reserve Bank of India also are a part of the process.Once the committee has drafted the bill, it then needs to be approved by the Finance Ministry. Once they approve it, it goes over to the Ministry of Law for another layer of endorsement to ensure it ticks all the boxes and doesn’t include any language that could get the government into trouble.Only once the bill has cleared both those thresholds does it make its way to the Cabinet. The ministers then discuss the bill to ascertain if any changes are required. If they feel the bill isn’t up to the mark, it will be sent back to the Finance Ministry.If not, the bill is presented to the public for comments before being introduced into the lower house of Parliament, the Lok Sabha. They then have three readings of the bill before it is passed to the upper house, the Rajya Sabha.Even then, the bill nevertheless needs approval from the President before it is eligible to come into effect.Depending on the changes suggested, it’s possible that the bill may not clear the Cabinet approval stage of the process. They could request for the Finance Ministry and other stakeholders to form an entirely new committee to draft a new version of the bill. They could even ask for a change at the helm with a department other than the Department of Economic Affairs — that, however, is unlikely.“The government seems to be looking at this afresh considering that there needs to be a different take on how to regulate cryptocurrencies rather than push for an outright ban” said Kailasam.The original committee that drafted India’s crypto bill was headed by Finance Secretary Subash Chandra Garg. Other members included MeitY Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney, SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi, and RBI Deputy Governor BP Kanungo.The version of the crypto bill proposed by them, the draft of which was released ahead of the Budget Session of Parliament in February, bans all ‘private’ cryptocurrencies and lays out a plan for India’s apex banking institution to launch its central bank digital currency (CBDC).The definition of ‘private’ cryptocurrencies was however ambiguous. Most speculate, as per the comments of RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, that this covers all cryptocurrencies traded on exchanges including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and others.This, however, does not mean that the central bank is proposing to ban the underlying blockchain platforms. One can ban Ether but the Ethereum blockchain, which facilitates the implementation of smart contracts, does not necessarily have to be pulled down.But, if the government is looking to take a softer stance, in line with the Supreme Court’s judgement in 2020 that abolished the RBI’s ban on cryptocurrencies, a new bill will likely have to be drafted. And, that process will again take its own sweet time cutting through the red tape.This means, just because the crypto bill is awaiting approval from the Cabinet, that it’s a done deal — especially as more and more Indian citizens are investing in cryptocurrency.

The central government had earlier formed the panel to study the issues related to digital currencies and propose specific actions regarding the crypto coins. “Cabinet note is ready on cryptocurrency (bill). I am awaiting Cabinet to clear that,"" finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday.

The proposed bill narrowly missed out on being tabled during the Monsoon Session of the Parliament. Cryptocurrency bill’s key purpose will be the “creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India,"" according to the bulletin for the Budget Session prepared by the Lok Sabha Secretariat. The bill also “seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India"" but it would permit “certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of crytptocurrency and its uses,"" the bulletin mentioned. The inter-ministerial panel has recommended that all private cryptocurrencies, except any virtual currencies issued by state, will be prohibited in India, according to reports.

Blanket Ban or an Asset Class? What Govt Says on Cryptocurrency

Earlier in May, finance minister had said that a very calibrated position will be taken on crypto and digital currency as the world is moving rapidly with technology. There have been reports that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be allowed as an asset class in India.

However the central government will not accept cryptocurrency as legal tender any time soon. The Centra has reiterated time and again that it does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin. During Budget 2018-19, the Union government had said that it will “take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system.”

Reserve Bank of India on Cryptocurrency

In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had “advised all the entities regulated by it not to deal in"" digital currencies. Later in 2020, the Supreme Court set aside the central bank’s 2018 circular and allowed banks and financial institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrencies. RBI had announced in May, 2021 that banks would be permitted to facilitate cryptocurrency trades after Supreme Court ruling.

The RBI has concerns on the cryptocurrencies traded in the market and has conveyed the same to the government. On cryptocurrency, there are no differences between the central bank and the finance ministry, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had maintained. “We should now await the final decision on the matter from the Centre,"" he added.

Crypto Craze in India

Indians have invested around $ 6.6 billion in cryptocurrencies till May 2021, according to an Analytics Insight report. This saw a over 600 per cent jump from $923 million in April 2020. Nearly 1.5 crore Indians are said to have invested in cryptocurrencies. At present, over 350 startups operate in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Considering the huge interest from the investors and rapidly grown cryptocurrency market, the government is taking a cautious approach towards cryptocurrencies.

“We are happy to see that the government is pushing for crypto legislation. However, we don’t know the final elements of the bill and what it entails for the crypto community and companies in India. Emerging technologies like Blockchain and cryptocurrency, AI and ML hold the key for future economic development.

2021-08-19,The Guardian,Why bitcoin entrepreneurs are flocking to rural Texas,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/17/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-mining-texas,"In the middle of rural Texas, a cryptocurrency mine is currently under construction.

Hundreds of machines more powerful than the average computer will soon be housed in this 320-acre mining facility in Dickens county, where they will work day and night to solve a complex series of algorithms. If successful, the reward will be newly minted bitcoin, currently worth about $44,000 each.

All the machines need to thrive are spaces to sit and electricity – lots of it.

Kevin Brendle, Dickens county’s top elected official, embraced the idea of the mine when Argo Blockchain, a Canadian cryptocurrency mining company, first approached him with the idea of building a facility in the area. Dickens county, population 2,300, “is mostly improved pasture and grassland”, Brendle said.

“It’s wide-open range land, it’s cattle country with a little farming,” he said. “We don’t have a lot of economic development.”

A mine could help stimulate the economy, creating jobs and improving the county’s tax base. And in return, the mine will be powered by some of the cheapest electricity in the world.

To be profitable, mining cryptocurrency requires lots of cheap energy. China was once the main hub for mining, with over half of the world’s mining taking place in the country, precisely because its electricity is cheap. But earlier this summer, local governments in China began to shut down bitcoin mines as the country works to develop its own, better-controlled digital currency. The bitcoin hashrate – the processing power used to produce bitcoin – halved after the crackdown.

Miners have since been scouring the globe for places where electricity is cheap, and many have settled on Texas as their destination.

Texas’s power grid is deregulated, which means customers can choose between different power providers and providers are thus incentivized to provide low rates.

Mining facilities can set up long-term contracts with power providers that allows them to purchase electricity at a fixed price for many years, says Jason Les, CEO of Riot Blockchain, a US-based cryptocurrency mining company.

Riot Blockchain recently acquired Whinstone US, the largest bitcoin mining facility in the US based in Rockdale, Texas, for $80m. Whinstone says its facility can produce 500 bitcoin per month – worth a total of $22m at bitcoin’s current value.

When demand for electricity goes up, particularly in the summer months, Texas power companies will actually pay mining facilities to lower their energy usage.

“If you were a miner that has a long-term power purchase agreement, then you own power at a fixed price … you’re committing to buying energy for years no matter what,” Les said.

“As a bitcoin miner, you essentially own that power, and that allows you to work like a virtual power plant. You can take the power that you agreed to buy at a fixed lower price, and then you can sell that back to the grid.”

In recent months, Texas leaders have been vocal about their support of cryptocurrency mining coming to their state.

In June, Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a bill that puts cryptocurrency under commercial law, making it easier for cryptocurrency businesses to operate in the state. In the same month, Abbott, tweeted: “Texas will be the cryptocurrency leader!” after the Texas grocery chain H-E-B announced that it will be putting cryptocurrency kiosks in some of its stores.

Also making the state attractive to miners is that 20% of its energy comes from wind power, making mining in Texas a much greener alternative than mining in China, where about two-thirds of electricity comes from coal. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, halted his company’s acceptance of bitcoin transactions, citing the “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel”. Musk said that Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin once there’s confirmation that about half of the energy used by miners will be from clean energy.

While states like Kentucky and Louisiana also have cheap power, and others like Wyoming – which recently made it easier for cryptocurrency businesses to become LLCs – have politicians that are cryptocurrency-friendly, Texas is the only state that seems to offer miners the best of both worlds.

“We’ve seen a good combination of political will with the reality of the electricity market there that have led people to start building in Texas,” said Josh Goodbody, chief operating office of Qredo, a digital asset management company. “Increasingly, people are looking at Texas as a friendly place to build crypto businesses.”

Along with the Argo and Whinstone facilities, BIT Mining, a Chinese mining company, has invested $25m to build a mine in Texas.

An influx of interest from cryptocurrency businesses does not come without risk, though. Bitmain, a China-based company, said in 2018 that it would invest $500m to build a huge mining facility in Rockdale, bringing jobs to a community that has seen huge job losses after a coal plant closure in 2008. But after the price of bitcoin dropped to just over $3,000 in the fall, the company pulled out of the project.

Brendle, of Dickens, said that his optimism is cautious. He has hope that cryptocurrency mining will be able to bolster his county’s economy and give stable jobs to some of his residents, but he notes that long-term sustainability is important.

“We see movement now, we see a lot of interest. We understand why that interest is there. But we just don’t know what the future of bitcoin mining is,” Brendle said. “I think that’s the biggest concern right now is how long, how well the industry will sustain itself.”","('https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f44434624752c0844ffd65649394276dca9de43d/0_141_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f5cc031656529a023526260d6883c543',)",none
