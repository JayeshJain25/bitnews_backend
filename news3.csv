Alex de Vries noted that this was ""extremely short compared to any"" other electronic devices such as iPhones.

NEW DELHI: The rallying cry for using cryptocurrency in the West and Europe could well be about investing in the most lucrative and stable digital asset for long-term investment.But in developing countries, with a shifting economy, people resort to cryptocurrency in dire economic conditions, for sending diaspora remittances or seeking financial relief from spiralling unemployment.Separate surveys - conducted by Statista in March 2021 and Finder and Chainalysis in August 2021 - on cryptocurrency ownership, adoption and usage ranked such developing countries among the top 20.Nigeria in South Africa, Vietnam and Philippines in SouthEast Asia and Venezuela and Argentina in Latin America were key names thrown up by the survey.This country had the highest cryptocurrency usage at 32 percent according to the Statista global survey in March 2021.Stiff regulations and high fees charged on inflowing remittances, made cryptocurrency the obvious choice of Nigerian expatriates for sending money across borders to their families.Strangely, Nigeria’s official records showed a consistent and sharp decline in the remittances inflow from $2.5 billion in January 2021 to $54.4 million in September 2021.However, remittances kept coming in through the private cryptocurrency services. Currently the government plans to launch its own e-naira for replacing cryptocurrency.The economic crisis of this country pales into insignificance in comparison to its indomitable zeal for prospering through cryptocurrency services. It was ranked top in the Chainalysis Adoption Index.Earlier Vietnam’s cryptocurrency usage was dominated by the need to send remittances to families for support, while now it's being diverted for future investment.In September 2021, Vietnam saw a resurgence of crypto mining activity and demand for mining rigs with the price rises of altcoins and Bitcoin . However, crypto mining is still not a regulated activity in Vietnam.The Philippines is among the top five countries in the world to receive remittances from overseas according to the World Bank , with an annual remittance of $32.5 billion.Acknowledging the impact of cryptocurrencies in revolutionizing the country's diaspora remittances and fundraising opportunities, the Central Bank of Philippines approved several crypto exchanges to operate as remittance and transfer companies in the country. The cryptocurrency adoption increased here for both investment and income generation.Fillipinos also constitute 40 percent of over 1 million Axie Infinity gamers. In the face of rampant unemployment post-pandemic, many locals looked up to this as an economic opportunity. Axie Infinity, a crypto-based play-to-earn game, provided relief to the jobless in the Philippines, Brazil and Venezuela.Sky-rocketing inflation in 2020, below $10 minimum wage, and cheap electricity of Venezuela have collectively propelled the crypto boom in this country.Cryptocurrencies are an easy and affordable way for the 5 million Venezuelan diaspora to send remittances home.Cheap power has ushered in flourishing crypto mining activity. Crypto mining has been a regulated activity in Venezuela since November 2020. For those who cannot purchase costly mining machines, getting into the Axie Infinity crypto game through scholarships is another route.This Latin American country languishing in 45 percent inflation, 42 percent poverty and 9.9 per cent GDP contraction in 2020, gained 2 million cryptocurrency users by May 2021. Argentinians have sought refuge in cryptocurrency services and trading from these economic woes.Colombia at 11th and Brazil at 14th in the Chainalysis cryptocurrency adoption index have also geared up for cryptocurrency usage, hedging against various economic problems in these countries.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-86313151,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50952,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",3 min read,"Cryptocurrency Live Previous NextHere are their stories:Nigeria:Vietnam:Philippines:Venezuela:Argentina:(For the latest crypto news, investment tips and real-time price updates, follow our.)

2021-09-18,News18,"Why Cryptocurrency is a Kardashian, Not Meryl Streep",https://www.news18.com/news/opinion/counterview-why-cryptocurrency-is-a-kardashian-not-meryl-streep-4216478.html,"Investment in currency comes in various shapes and sizes, but they can be broadly whittled down to two propositions: one based on Kim Kardashian, the other on Meryl Streep. Both are well-known celebrities—one new, the other old; one a reality star, the other a talented actor. The new one can drive hype and ‘break the Internet’, the other is a benchmark for acting excellence. One thrives on Instagram and has an army to manage her social media; the other is more nuanced, uses traditional media and has proved her mettle.

Cryptocurrency is the Kardashian of the investment world; you don’t know its intrinsic value but go by the short-term perceptions of a fleeting crowd of this being a hot investment. The value of cryptocurrencies has spiralled up so high that it is recommended as an investment option. To stretch the analogy, if Kim Kardashian were to say “I am Meryl Streep” or better “I am Crypto Streep, which is Meryl and better,” would investors buy that? They normally wouldn’t but that’s happening now—not only is cryptocurrency being seen as the real currency, it’s perceived by some as even better than the real currency as its value keeps going up as more and more people buy into it. Normally, if the value of anything only goes up if more people invest (mine) in it, it is a ponzi scheme.

Several cryptocurrency exchanges sell cryptocurrency as an investment. Normally, an entity selling investment options needs to register as an investment advisor with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). But these cryptocurrency exchanges are bypassing that legal formality of registration or compliance. SEBI is also watching from the sidelines—watching Page One articles and advertisements advising investment in cryptocurrency.

VIEW | RBI Lost Case on Cryptocurrency in Supreme Court, It Must Stop Behaving Like Sore Loser

Whatever be the perception or “sentiment”, the term “cryptocurrency” itself is a misnomer. There is nothing cryptic about it nor is it a currency. The currency bit is added to give credibility to what is basically a token on a general digital ledger. Supporters of cryptocurrency would have us believe that this is the future of currency because it is about technology; technology is inevitable, its march is inexorable, it is inescapable, and India will fall behind the development curve if it ignores technology. The shysters have repeated this argument so many times that the Supreme Court and even Parliament believe that cryptocurrency should be legitimized. This while the savvy investors behind this fake currency are running circles around them. They have even been able to convince Parliament to introduce a bill to ensure that they are a legitimate investment option. The bill is pending approval and it will effectively turn Kim Kardashian into a Meryl Streep. It may not be physically possible but could be legislatively made possible.

Cryptocurrency has to be called what it is—it’s an all-out fake. It’s not even a currency. A currency is real ONLY if it is issued by the central bank. Every other currency with any first name is a fake. Any digital currency being used in India can be a real currency only if it is issued by the RBI. The RBI is issuing a digital currency of its own. One that will have intrinsic value as it will be guaranteed by the central bank as convertible into real rupees. RBI’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will clear the funk around cryptocurrency. Which is why venture capitalists and private investors who have put money into it are trying to sell as much of it to unsuspecting retail investors before it all turns to junk. They are trying to push a bill through Parliament. They are trying to force the Supreme Court to intervene so that the regulator does not ban it. So far, they have been able to confuse enough people into believing that the fake currency is the future as it is about technology. A cryptocurrency is as much about technology as an aluminium manufacturing company is about power. Just because an aluminium company uses power to convert bauxite into aluminium! If a fake currency company uses blockchain technology, how is it about technology? Using technology does not make cryptocurrency real.

Cryptocurrency is not a legal matter for the judiciary; it is a regulatory matter that has to be decided by SEBI and RBI. The central bank decides what is a legal currency in the country, and it has already said that it is progressing with a regulatory structure to make CBDC possible. SEBI has the jurisdiction and the power to prevent all the cryptocurrency exchanges from selling this fake currency as an investment vehicle. It has chosen not to exercise its powers in spite of the confusion all this is creating. It is waiting for a scam to happen—something we saw with the collective investment schemes (CIS) in the past.

Parliament should not pass a bill that will legitimize a fake currency and will create all sorts of challenges for the economy. A fake currency creates a fake economy parallel to the real one, hiding transactions, and hiding them from taxation. Should Parliament be part of an active creation of a parallel economy, only to realize the mistake after they have passed the bill? It is the fervent hope of all right-thinking citizens that the Supreme Court does not allow itself to be persuaded that our central bank does not understand currency; that the Ministry of Finance does not understand the workings of a parallel economy; that the only ones who understand technology, currency, and their importance to an economy are a motley bunch that has been deceiving and sidestepping governments and regulators across the world

2021-09-18,Florida News Times,What You Need to Know About Cryptocurrency Stocks,https://floridanewstimes.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-cryptocurrency-stocks/343748/,"What You Need to Know About Cryptocurrency Stocks

Way back in 2013, Bitcoin was worth only about $100. Since then, it has enjoyed an all-time high price of almost $65,000 per Bitcoin. Even today, Bitcoin is worth almost $50,000 per Bitcoin!

A lot of people became very rich by investing in Bitcoin. Other people who doubted the viability of cryptocurrency quickly changed their minds in response to the huge success of Bitcoin. Now that more people are getting into the cryptocurrency game, they are creating many other coins to compete with Bitcoin.

So which of the less famous cryptocurrency stocks is the best one to invest in? Read on to learn all about how you can find the best investment opportunities in cryptocurrency!

Bitcoin

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and it is still the largest. It has made more millionaires and billionaires than any other cryptocurrency. Many people turn to bitcoin for what they feel is a safe investment.

On the other hand, since Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, it is also not very high tech. Other currencies provide many inancial tools, like smart contracts. In contrast, Bitcoin doesn’t really do anything except act as a medium of exchange.

Ethereum

Ethereum is the second-largest of all cryptocurrencies. It got that way by providing financial tools that Bitcoin didn’t. Ethereum allows for smart contracts.

Smart contracts are contracts that execute themselves without requiring a person to manage the execution. This is much safer than relying on a person to execute a contract since not everybody is trustworthy.

This is especially relevant in some countries where there are not trustworthy insurance companies. Some farmers live without crop insurance because they do not have a local insurance provider that they can trust.

But with the power of smart contracts, farmers can buy contracts and know that they will be honored. Insurance is only one financial tool like this. Ethereum smart contracts are the foundation of dozens of apps and financial tools.

Cardano

Cardano is the third biggest cryptocurrency. It is attempting to replace Ethereum, and maybe even Bitcoin. Ethereum is expensive, while Cardano is cheap. Cardano does not yet offer smart contracts, but it is about to start.

That may allow it to suddenly increase in value, making it a potential investment opportunity.

Of course, the best cryptocurrency stock 2021 has available is not going to always be the best cryptocurrency stock. If you have ever asked, “What is cryptocurrency?”, then one of the first things you should know about cryptocurrency stock prices is that they can change very quickly.

It is important to have tools that allow you to move significant amounts of money in and out of crypto quickly. To learn more about what is cryptocurrency and how you can buy and sell it, check out Byte Federal.

We hope that you were able to learn something helpful about a few of the biggest cryptocurrency stocks on the market. The world of cryptocurrency has exploded in just the past few years. By all appearances, it is not just an up-and-comer in the present, but it may well be the future of finance.

The coin jumped by 35% in value after it was added to the platform, according to Mint, which monitors financial and cryptocurrency news.

Coinbase added the cryptocurrency earlier this week, allowing users to trade Shiba Inu coin on Coinbase.com and the company’s mobile app.

“We are happy to announce that $SHIB is now officially live and listed on @coinbase and the Coinbase App,” Shib coin said on Twitter.

Is Shib coin available on other apps?

Earlier in September, Coinbase added Shiba Inu Coin to the Coinbase Pro app, which is an additional trading platform for professions, as I wrote for the Deseret News.

There has been ongoing speculation that Shiba Inu coin would join Coinbase after the Coinbase Custody platform, which allows people to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrency assets, added support for the Shib coin token.

Will Shib coin’s value rise?

For some time, investors thought Shiba Inu coin would spike in price and value because of its listing on Coinbase. Shiba Inu coin often draws more value when it’s mentioned on social media because a lot of its value is driven by hype. When social media hypes it up, people will learn more about the coin and invest.

That said, Shib coin is still a risky investment. “Memecoins are highly volatile cryptocurrencies that are known to witnesses sharp movements based on news events,” according to Mint.","('https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IJlSbzb__nuFtIaSP8ZnE33OoYc=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859100/Shiba_1_Still.jpg',)",2 min read,"Coinbase added the cryptocurrency earlier this week, allowing users to trade Shiba Inu coin on Coinbase.com and the company’s mobile app.

The smart contract platform Avalanche (AVAX) is trading at $65.02 at time of writing, having achieved an all-time high of $68.34 at one point on Thursday, according to CoinGecko.

The Avalanche Foundation also announced on Thursday that it had completed a $230 million private token sale to a slew of blockchain asset investment firms, crypto hedge funds, angel investors, and family offices, including Polychain Capital and Three Arrows Capital.

The foundation plans to allocate this money into expanding decentralized finance (DeFi), enterprise applications, and other use cases on the Avalanche public blockchain. The sale was completed in June.

According to Avalanche Foundation director Emin Gün Sirer,

“Despite being years younger than its peers, Avalanche has quickly turned promise and potential into real-world impact and value creation for DeFi users and developers.

The community of builders rallying around the network is a testament to its competitive edge, and there is still so much potential yet to be tapped at the intersection of institutional and decentralized finance on Avalanche.”

Recent research from the early-stage venture capital firm Outlier Ventures indicates that Avalanche has demonstrated explosive growth in terms of developer activity during the past year.

At 30,700 tonnes, the amount of electronic waste generated by bitcoin mining in the 12 months to May was ""comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the Netherlands"", the report said.

The race to find new bitcoins -- on Friday, one unit was worth more than $47,000 following a stellar rise this year -- means the mining computers' processing power soon becomes obsolete.

And the more bitcoin is worth, the larger the amount of electronic waste, according to the study published by scientific journal, Elsevier.

Alex de Vries works as an economist at the Dutch central bank, while the report's co-author Christian Stoll is from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

NEW DELHI: The rallying cry for using cryptocurrency in the West and Europe could well be about investing in the most lucrative and stable digital asset for long-term investment.But in developing countries, with a shifting economy, people resort to cryptocurrency in dire economic conditions, for sending diaspora remittances or seeking financial relief from spiralling unemployment.Separate surveys - conducted by Statista in March 2021 and Finder and Chainalysis in August 2021 - on cryptocurrency ownership, adoption and usage ranked such developing countries among the top 20.Nigeria in South Africa, Vietnam and Philippines in SouthEast Asia and Venezuela and Argentina in Latin America were key names thrown up by the survey.This country had the highest cryptocurrency usage at 32 percent according to the Statista global survey in March 2021.Stiff regulations and high fees charged on inflowing remittances, made cryptocurrency the obvious choice of Nigerian expatriates for sending money across borders to their families.Strangely, Nigeria’s official records showed a consistent and sharp decline in the remittances inflow from $2.5 billion in January 2021 to $54.4 million in September 2021.However, remittances kept coming in through the private cryptocurrency services. Currently the government plans to launch its own e-naira for replacing cryptocurrency.The economic crisis of this country pales into insignificance in comparison to its indomitable zeal for prospering through cryptocurrency services. It was ranked top in the Chainalysis Adoption Index.Earlier Vietnam’s cryptocurrency usage was dominated by the need to send remittances to families for support, while now it's being diverted for future investment.In September 2021, Vietnam saw a resurgence of crypto mining activity and demand for mining rigs with the price rises of altcoins and Bitcoin . However, crypto mining is still not a regulated activity in Vietnam.The Philippines is among the top five countries in the world to receive remittances from overseas according to the World Bank , with an annual remittance of $32.5 billion.Acknowledging the impact of cryptocurrencies in revolutionizing the country's diaspora remittances and fundraising opportunities, the Central Bank of Philippines approved several crypto exchanges to operate as remittance and transfer companies in the country. The cryptocurrency adoption increased here for both investment and income generation.Fillipinos also constitute 40 percent of over 1 million Axie Infinity gamers. In the face of rampant unemployment post-pandemic, many locals looked up to this as an economic opportunity. Axie Infinity, a crypto-based play-to-earn game, provided relief to the jobless in the Philippines, Brazil and Venezuela.Sky-rocketing inflation in 2020, below $10 minimum wage, and cheap electricity of Venezuela have collectively propelled the crypto boom in this country.Cryptocurrencies are an easy and affordable way for the 5 million Venezuelan diaspora to send remittances home.Cheap power has ushered in flourishing crypto mining activity. Crypto mining has been a regulated activity in Venezuela since November 2020. For those who cannot purchase costly mining machines, getting into the Axie Infinity crypto game through scholarships is another route.This Latin American country languishing in 45 percent inflation, 42 percent poverty and 9.9 per cent GDP contraction in 2020, gained 2 million cryptocurrency users by May 2021. Argentinians have sought refuge in cryptocurrency services and trading from these economic woes.Colombia at 11th and Brazil at 14th in the Chainalysis cryptocurrency adoption index have also geared up for cryptocurrency usage, hedging against various economic problems in these countries.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-86313151,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50952,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",3 min read,"Cryptocurrency Live Previous NextHere are their stories:Nigeria:Vietnam:Philippines:Venezuela:Argentina:(For the latest crypto news, investment tips and real-time price updates, follow our.)

2021-09-18,News18,"Why Cryptocurrency is a Kardashian, Not Meryl Streep",https://www.news18.com/news/opinion/counterview-why-cryptocurrency-is-a-kardashian-not-meryl-streep-4216478.html,"Investment in currency comes in various shapes and sizes, but they can be broadly whittled down to two propositions: one based on Kim Kardashian, the other on Meryl Streep. Both are well-known celebrities—one new, the other old; one a reality star, the other a talented actor. The new one can drive hype and ‘break the Internet’, the other is a benchmark for acting excellence. One thrives on Instagram and has an army to manage her social media; the other is more nuanced, uses traditional media and has proved her mettle.

Cryptocurrency is the Kardashian of the investment world; you don’t know its intrinsic value but go by the short-term perceptions of a fleeting crowd of this being a hot investment. The value of cryptocurrencies has spiralled up so high that it is recommended as an investment option. To stretch the analogy, if Kim Kardashian were to say “I am Meryl Streep” or better “I am Crypto Streep, which is Meryl and better,” would investors buy that? They normally wouldn’t but that’s happening now—not only is cryptocurrency being seen as the real currency, it’s perceived by some as even better than the real currency as its value keeps going up as more and more people buy into it. Normally, if the value of anything only goes up if more people invest (mine) in it, it is a ponzi scheme.

Several cryptocurrency exchanges sell cryptocurrency as an investment. Normally, an entity selling investment options needs to register as an investment advisor with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). But these cryptocurrency exchanges are bypassing that legal formality of registration or compliance. SEBI is also watching from the sidelines—watching Page One articles and advertisements advising investment in cryptocurrency.

VIEW | RBI Lost Case on Cryptocurrency in Supreme Court, It Must Stop Behaving Like Sore Loser

Whatever be the perception or “sentiment”, the term “cryptocurrency” itself is a misnomer. There is nothing cryptic about it nor is it a currency. The currency bit is added to give credibility to what is basically a token on a general digital ledger. Supporters of cryptocurrency would have us believe that this is the future of currency because it is about technology; technology is inevitable, its march is inexorable, it is inescapable, and India will fall behind the development curve if it ignores technology. The shysters have repeated this argument so many times that the Supreme Court and even Parliament believe that cryptocurrency should be legitimized. This while the savvy investors behind this fake currency are running circles around them. They have even been able to convince Parliament to introduce a bill to ensure that they are a legitimate investment option. The bill is pending approval and it will effectively turn Kim Kardashian into a Meryl Streep. It may not be physically possible but could be legislatively made possible.

Cryptocurrency has to be called what it is—it’s an all-out fake. It’s not even a currency. A currency is real ONLY if it is issued by the central bank. Every other currency with any first name is a fake. Any digital currency being used in India can be a real currency only if it is issued by the RBI. The RBI is issuing a digital currency of its own. One that will have intrinsic value as it will be guaranteed by the central bank as convertible into real rupees. RBI’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will clear the funk around cryptocurrency. Which is why venture capitalists and private investors who have put money into it are trying to sell as much of it to unsuspecting retail investors before it all turns to junk. They are trying to push a bill through Parliament. They are trying to force the Supreme Court to intervene so that the regulator does not ban it. So far, they have been able to confuse enough people into believing that the fake currency is the future as it is about technology. A cryptocurrency is as much about technology as an aluminium manufacturing company is about power. Just because an aluminium company uses power to convert bauxite into aluminium! If a fake currency company uses blockchain technology, how is it about technology? Using technology does not make cryptocurrency real.

Cryptocurrency is not a legal matter for the judiciary; it is a regulatory matter that has to be decided by SEBI and RBI. The central bank decides what is a legal currency in the country, and it has already said that it is progressing with a regulatory structure to make CBDC possible. SEBI has the jurisdiction and the power to prevent all the cryptocurrency exchanges from selling this fake currency as an investment vehicle. It has chosen not to exercise its powers in spite of the confusion all this is creating. It is waiting for a scam to happen—something we saw with the collective investment schemes (CIS) in the past.

Parliament should not pass a bill that will legitimize a fake currency and will create all sorts of challenges for the economy. A fake currency creates a fake economy parallel to the real one, hiding transactions, and hiding them from taxation. Should Parliament be part of an active creation of a parallel economy, only to realize the mistake after they have passed the bill? It is the fervent hope of all right-thinking citizens that the Supreme Court does not allow itself to be persuaded that our central bank does not understand currency; that the Ministry of Finance does not understand the workings of a parallel economy; that the only ones who understand technology, currency, and their importance to an economy are a motley bunch that has been deceiving and sidestepping governments and regulators across the world

2021-09-18,Florida News Times,What You Need to Know About Cryptocurrency Stocks,https://floridanewstimes.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-cryptocurrency-stocks/343748/,"What You Need to Know About Cryptocurrency Stocks

Way back in 2013, Bitcoin was worth only about $100. Since then, it has enjoyed an all-time high price of almost $65,000 per Bitcoin. Even today, Bitcoin is worth almost $50,000 per Bitcoin!

A lot of people became very rich by investing in Bitcoin. Other people who doubted the viability of cryptocurrency quickly changed their minds in response to the huge success of Bitcoin. Now that more people are getting into the cryptocurrency game, they are creating many other coins to compete with Bitcoin.

So which of the less famous cryptocurrency stocks is the best one to invest in? Read on to learn all about how you can find the best investment opportunities in cryptocurrency!

Bitcoin

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and it is still the largest. It has made more millionaires and billionaires than any other cryptocurrency. Many people turn to bitcoin for what they feel is a safe investment.

On the other hand, since Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, it is also not very high tech. Other currencies provide many inancial tools, like smart contracts. In contrast, Bitcoin doesn’t really do anything except act as a medium of exchange.

Ethereum

Ethereum is the second-largest of all cryptocurrencies. It got that way by providing financial tools that Bitcoin didn’t. Ethereum allows for smart contracts.

Smart contracts are contracts that execute themselves without requiring a person to manage the execution. This is much safer than relying on a person to execute a contract since not everybody is trustworthy.

This is especially relevant in some countries where there are not trustworthy insurance companies. Some farmers live without crop insurance because they do not have a local insurance provider that they can trust.

But with the power of smart contracts, farmers can buy contracts and know that they will be honored. Insurance is only one financial tool like this. Ethereum smart contracts are the foundation of dozens of apps and financial tools.

Cardano

Cardano is the third biggest cryptocurrency. It is attempting to replace Ethereum, and maybe even Bitcoin. Ethereum is expensive, while Cardano is cheap. Cardano does not yet offer smart contracts, but it is about to start.

That may allow it to suddenly increase in value, making it a potential investment opportunity.

Of course, the best cryptocurrency stock 2021 has available is not going to always be the best cryptocurrency stock. If you have ever asked, “What is cryptocurrency?”, then one of the first things you should know about cryptocurrency stock prices is that they can change very quickly.

It is important to have tools that allow you to move significant amounts of money in and out of crypto quickly. To learn more about what is cryptocurrency and how you can buy and sell it, check out Byte Federal.

We hope that you were able to learn something helpful about a few of the biggest cryptocurrency stocks on the market. The world of cryptocurrency has exploded in just the past few years. By all appearances, it is not just an up-and-comer in the present, but it may well be the future of finance.

The coin jumped by 35% in value after it was added to the platform, according to Mint, which monitors financial and cryptocurrency news.

Coinbase added the cryptocurrency earlier this week, allowing users to trade Shiba Inu coin on Coinbase.com and the company’s mobile app.

“We are happy to announce that $SHIB is now officially live and listed on @coinbase and the Coinbase App,” Shib coin said on Twitter.

Is Shib coin available on other apps?

Earlier in September, Coinbase added Shiba Inu Coin to the Coinbase Pro app, which is an additional trading platform for professions, as I wrote for the Deseret News.

There has been ongoing speculation that Shiba Inu coin would join Coinbase after the Coinbase Custody platform, which allows people to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrency assets, added support for the Shib coin token.

Will Shib coin’s value rise?

For some time, investors thought Shiba Inu coin would spike in price and value because of its listing on Coinbase. Shiba Inu coin often draws more value when it’s mentioned on social media because a lot of its value is driven by hype. When social media hypes it up, people will learn more about the coin and invest.

That said, Shib coin is still a risky investment. “Memecoins are highly volatile cryptocurrencies that are known to witnesses sharp movements based on news events,” according to Mint.","('https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IJlSbzb__nuFtIaSP8ZnE33OoYc=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859100/Shiba_1_Still.jpg',)",2 min read,"Coinbase added the cryptocurrency earlier this week, allowing users to trade Shiba Inu coin on Coinbase.com and the company’s mobile app.

The smart contract platform Avalanche (AVAX) is trading at $65.02 at time of writing, having achieved an all-time high of $68.34 at one point on Thursday, according to CoinGecko.

The Avalanche Foundation also announced on Thursday that it had completed a $230 million private token sale to a slew of blockchain asset investment firms, crypto hedge funds, angel investors, and family offices, including Polychain Capital and Three Arrows Capital.

The foundation plans to allocate this money into expanding decentralized finance (DeFi), enterprise applications, and other use cases on the Avalanche public blockchain. The sale was completed in June.

According to Avalanche Foundation director Emin Gün Sirer,

“Despite being years younger than its peers, Avalanche has quickly turned promise and potential into real-world impact and value creation for DeFi users and developers.

The community of builders rallying around the network is a testament to its competitive edge, and there is still so much potential yet to be tapped at the intersection of institutional and decentralized finance on Avalanche.”

Recent research from the early-stage venture capital firm Outlier Ventures indicates that Avalanche has demonstrated explosive growth in terms of developer activity during the past year.

2021-09-17,NDTV Gadgets 360,"Bitcoin Is Being Killed by Regulators in Countries Like India and China, Says Billionaire Ray Dalio",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/ray-dalio-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-being-killed-by-regulators-in-india-china-2544545,"American billionaire Ray Dalio expressed concerns about countries like India and China strangling the growth of world's largest valued cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Speaking to the press earlier this week, the 72-year-old former co-chief investment officer of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said he fears that if Bitcoin gets more popular, global regulators will try to kill the cryptocurrency. The business tycoon also said that despite not being totally onboard with digital currencies in the past, he has converted a portion of his portfolio into Bitcoin.

As per a report by portal CryptoPotato, Dalio feels that countries like India and China are trying to “get rid” of cryptocurrencies. While China has banned trading and transacting in digital currencies, India remains shaky in its approach towards securing the future of cryptos.

“I think at the end of the day if it (Bitcoin) is really successful, they (global regulators) will kill it, and they will try to kill it,” the report quoted Dalio as saying.

The famous investor further highlighted that people must have enough diversification in their portfolios before entering the crypto space given the constant market uncertainty. He has laid emphasis on investors keeping finances safe in the form of gold or other highly valued commodities.

Despite anti-crypto voices like that of Christine Lagarde, the president of European Central Bank questioning the credibility of cryptocurrencies, the digital finance tokens are witnessing fandom among global traders and investors.

The billionaire investor had last month said that Bitcoin was akin to digital gold. A constant evaluation of your investments is the key, according to Dalio. He further suggested avoiding buying an asset like Bitcoin just because of its temporary boom. “Be careful about what you're putting your money in⁠,” he said.

Earlier this month, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin a legal tender alongside the US dollar.

The decision was welcomed by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, who predicted that many more nations will follow the Central American country in adopting Bitcoin, which is the largest cryptocurrency in the world.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/cryptocurrency_mix_stock_pexels_1627728358830.jpg',)",2 min read,"American billionaire Ray Dalio expressed concerns about countries like India and China strangling the growth of world's largest valued cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

2021-09-17,Yahoo Finance,"Diem cryptocurrency will be in 'class of its own,' Facebook executive says",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-exec-says-revamped-diem-cryptocurrency-will-be-in-class-of-its-own-133929181.html,"Facebook (FB) has a plan to take over the world of digital wallets, using cryptocurrency to separate it from the likes of PayPal (PYPL) and other digital payment platforms. Its upcoming digital wallet, Novi, will be built upon the still-pending stablecoin Diem.

Diem is the cryptocurrency that grew out of Facebook’s in-house project that began in 2017 and was first known as Libra. After it was publicly revealed in 2018, the coin received intense scrutiny in Washington, DC, and around the industry.

The cryptocurrency project, rebranded as Diem, now operates as an independent association but retains close ties to Facebook. Facebook executive David Marcus straddles both worlds, sitting on Diem's board of directors and heading up Facebook Financial — which plans to launch Novi in the coming months.

This week, Marcus sat down with Yahoo Finance for a wide-ranging conversation for Influencers with Andy Serwer, a weekly series featuring biggest names in business, politics, entertainment, sports, and academia. Speaking to Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief, Andy Serwer, Marcus made the case for why Facebook still believes Diem is the right platform to build Facebook's new digital wallet around.

“We believe that in terms of consumer protections, both on the purpose built payments blockchain that Diem is and on the stablecoin itself, it’s in a class of its own,” Marcus says.

Diem digital wallet trying to ‘solve the systemic issues’

Marcus says it would have been easier to build the wallet to run on “existing rails.”

""As a matter of fact, a lot of people internally/externally have been puzzled by why we didn't do it that way,"" he added. But using existing rails, he said, “would actually not solve the systemic issues that we believe exists currently in our current payments infrastructure.”

Story continues

Diem coins will be backed by a combination of cash or cash equivalents and short-term government securities, which Marcus says will keep them secure. Ultimately, he said, that is “much better than a current deposit with a traditional wallet here in the U.S.”

Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Marcus also addressed initial concerns over whether Facebook’s coin had enough provisions to stop criminals who have gravitated to cryptocurrencies.

“I actually think and strongly believe that new infrastructure that enables more real time reporting to all of the right authorities at the right time,” Marcus says.

A number of other blockchains have improved their traceability, he acknowledged. But, he added, “I think in our case, we've taken it like really, really to a whole new level.”

A goal of launching Diem cryptocurrency 'before the end of this year'

Whether the industry agrees with Marcus’s outlook is yet to be seen. Libra has struggled to hold on to members with financial giants like Mastercard and Visa leaving the project in 2019.

Back then, Marcus often discussed the association’s goal of 100 members by launch, including in a Yahoo Finance interview at the time. Currently, the association lists 26 members on its site with the regulatory approval process still ongoing.

In a 2019 interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung, Marcus insisted that Libra was ""absolutely not"" in jeopardy. Still, the launch date of the project was pushed back from 2020. Currently, Novi aims to launch before the end of the year along with Diem. Still, Marcus added in his most recent interview with Yahoo Finance, “We are definitely not going to launch without the proper regulatory framework.”

Between July 2020 and June 2021, Africa's cryptocurrency market grew by 1,200 percent – making up for a whopping $105.6 billion (roughly Rs. 775 crores), a recent report by Chainalysis said. Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania all rank among the top 20 countries on the Global Crypto Adoption Index, and together, the African nations represent the third most rapidly growing cryptocurrency market in the world. The report also noted that the bulk of these crypto transactions aren't driven by large institutional investors, but instead small and medium-sized retail buyers and businesses.

As per the report by market research firm Chainalysis, Africa records plenty of smaller transfer sizes indicating higher adoption of cryptocurrency trading at the grassroots level.

“Cross-region transfers also make up a bigger share of Africa's cryptocurrency market than any other region at 96 percent of all transaction volume, versus 78 percent for all regions combined,” the report said.

The study further observed that facilitating crypto payments using peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms is more popular in Africa, as compared to other countries. P2P platforms are online investment gateways that enable borrowers to attract lenders to identify and purchase loans that meet their investment criteria. Using these platforms, Africa-based crypto buyers and investors get into trading in digital currencies.

“Some countries, such as Nigeria and Kenya, have made it difficult for customers to send money to cryptocurrency businesses from their bank accounts, either by passing laws or simply by advising banks not to allow these transfers. However, this isn't an issue for P2P platforms, which are non-custodial and let customers trade cash for cryptocurrency amongst themselves,” Chainalysis explained.

For now, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, and Ukraine are sitting at the top four ranks of rapid crypto adoption. The rate of cryptocurrency adoption rose by 880 percent in 2020 in these regions, a report released earlier this month had claimed.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_disco_reuters_1622203490843.jpg',)",2 min read,"Cryptocurrency adoption in Africa is booming, according to a new report by cryptocurrency analysis firm Chainalysis.

2021-09-17,CNBCTV18,'Dogefather' Elon Musk tweets Floki Inu to new heights: All you need to know about crypto world's new sensation,https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/dogefather-elon-musk-creates-floki-inu-all-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-worlds-newest-star-10780061.htm,"When the cryptocurrency was in the midst of a fiery bull market in March 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk added a tinder when he announced: “I’m getting a Shiba Inu.” By June 25, when he posted another tweet, this time saying, “My Shiba Inu will be named Floki,” the cryptocurrency market had shed hundreds of billions of dollars. But the recent turmoil was no problem when on September 12, he posted “Floki has arrived” along with an image of a cute pooch sleeping on the rug. By September 15, Floki Inu (FLOKI) had appreciated 1000 percent. The crypto world saw the unbelievable drama unfolding in front of their eyes and their wallets swelling 10-folds within a matter of 72 hours. Elon Musk had done it again.

Shiba Inu is a breed of Dogecoin, a memecoin at its basic, and Floki Inu is the new star of this breed.

When Musk posted his tweet announcing the arrival of Floki on September 12, the meme coin was trading at $0.00001831. Eagled-eyed crypto enthusiasts rushed to the laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In about 75 minutes, Floki was trading at $0.00004037, up nearly 120 percent. It meant every dollar invested before Musk’s tweet had become $2.20. It came from a coin that was not even among the top 2000 coins. In the next 20 minutes, the coin saw a correction of about 35 percent, punishing the latecomers. Not just Floki Inu, but other Floki themed coins such as Shiba Inu, FlokiPup Inu, Baby Floki Inu, and Floki Shiba Inu also saw significant appreciation post-Musk tweet.

A bit about Floki Inu

Floki Inu is a new digital coin that came into being in June 2021 and has a definite link with Elon Musk. The Floki Inu website says, “Floki Inu is Elon Musk’s very own Shiba Inu, and he’s hungry for outer-space treats!”. At present, the coin has about 100,000 holders and expects the market cap to be $5 billion by November 2021.

How Elon Musk used a different way to move markets this time

For a long time, Musk carried the moniker of Dogefather in the crypto world. Now, with the launch of Floki Inu, he has officially fathered a digital coin. It’s his coin built on his tech-intensive promises of spacewalks, space travels and space living. With Floki Inu, Musk has once again displayed his ability to shake up the crypto market.

Earlier this year, he made the coins berserk on the exchanges with his strategic purchase of bitcoins worth $1.5 billion and some cryptic tweets. Bitcoin made impressive gains in subsequent months, leading to an all-time high of $65,000.

Then, Dogecoin saw a ludicrous rise of over 15,000 percent in a year, primarily thanks to Musk’s interest in the coin through tweets in the first few months of 2021. Then, he made bitcoin look more legitimate and attractive by accepting it as a medium of payment for his Tesla cars. It was the beginning of a bullish run on the exchange where most coins appreciated.

But Musk ditched both Dogecoin and Bitcoin weeks afterwards, making the market melt and lose roughly $300 billion. At a time when meme coin doge had risen to become the 4th largest coin, Musk dropped a tweet saying, “I’m getting a Shiba Inu.” Soon, he also announced that Tesla would not accept bitcoin as payment because the coin is not eco-friendly.

Shiba Inu is a dog belonging to a breed of Japanese hunter dogs. Dogecoin is also a coin with a dog as the theme. And there are quite a few other digital coins with Shiba Inu as the theme, with Dogecoin leading the pack in popularity and valuation. All these coins are meme coins meaning they don’t offer any of the values and applications that the Ethereum network, for example, offers. Now, Ethereum is not alone as a host of other networks such as Cardano, Polkadot, and Solana offer more value and functionality on their networks.","('https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/elonmusk-1019x573.jpg',)",3 min read,"By September 15, Floki Inu (FLOKI) had appreciated 1000 percent.

2021-09-17,NDTV Gadgets 360,"Post London Upgrade, Ethereum Worth $1 Billion Taken Out Of Circulation",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/ethereum-coins-worth-more-than-1-billion-burnt-after-london-upgrade-2544250,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after Bitcoin, underwent a major upgrade on August 5 this year. Called the London Hard Fork, the latest upgrade was a set of five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). These included EIP 1559, which was aimed at changing the speed and incentivise the mining of the cryptocurrency. EIP 1559 also addressed the criticism Ethereum faced for rising network congestion and transaction costs by introducing a new burning method that simplified the process. Since the upgrade, more than 3 lakh Ethereum coins (Ether) worth over $1 billion (roughly Rs. 7,350 crore) have been burned, or taken out of circulation.

OpenSea, the popular NFT marketplace, accounts for the most burns on the Ethereum network, representing around 43,801 ether coins worth nearly $148 million (roughly Rs. 1,087 crore). It is followed by traditional ether transfers, which stands at 25,999 ether coins worth $88 million (roughly Rs. 646 crore).

According to crypto analytics group Dune Analytics, 3,09,973 coins have been burned so far. Their total worth stands at $1.05 billion (roughly Rs. 7,717 crore), that is lost forever.

The EIP-1559 changed Ethereum's fee rate to a new scheme that makes Ether deflationary. It has been able to reduce the amount of ETH produced daily and increase the amount of burned ether. In the new scheme, one can burn a large amount of transaction fees —called the “base fee” — instead of sending it to miners. According to the EIP 1559 proposal, this was done to counterbalance Ethereum inflation while still giving the block reward and priority fee (the maximum fee users are willing to spend to add their transaction to a block) to miners.

One of the main reasons for the high rate of burned ether is Ethereum's high transaction fees (gas fee). Ethereum handles an estimated 1.2 million transactions on the network daily.

According to CoinMarketCap, ether was trading at $3,517 (roughly Rs. 2.58 lakh) at the time of writing this report.

Ethereum is a decentralised, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality and ether is its native cryptocurrency. It is represented by symbol ETH.

What Happened: According to CoinMarketCap data, as of press time Friday Dogecoin is trading at $0.243 after seeing its price increase by about 1.4% over the previous 24 hours. As noted Thursday, it's critical for the coin's price to keep above the 0.13 Fibonacci level at $0.235 — where the coin has been trading for over a week — for it to test the resistance at $0.297.

See Also: Be A Good Boi! Why Dogecoin Must Hold This Key Support Level

On Thursday, Dogecoin closed its daily candle at $0.242 after flirting with the support by dipping down to $0.233. The coin's RSI is slowly approaching the oversold territory and currently standing at under 42.

If the RSI falls much lower without the $0.235 support being invalidated then we should start expecting a trend reversal starting a new uptrend that won't see major obstacles until it hits the $0.297 level.

Hitting the $0.297 level would also mean that the price would reach above the Ichimoku's Kumo — which also recently became bullish — which would then start acting as a support as well. If the current resistance were to be invalidated, it could result in Dogecoin going to freefall until it hits a floor at $0.16. Any bullish sentiment would be invalidated if this support were to be breached signaling new lows and setting the idea in stone that DOGE is in a downtrend.

2021-09-17,WHIO-TV,Statue of Bitcoin founder honors mysterious 'god' of cryptocurrency,https://www.whio.com/news/business/statue-bitcoin/5RKUAS3AV2BP3OWOLU3BRTSVJ4/,"BUDAPEST, Hungary — Cryptocurrency enthusiasts unveiled what they say is the world's first statue of mystery-shrouded Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, at a park in Budapest, Hungary.

The expressionless, ultra-shiny bust is meant to represent ""a general human figure, since we do not know the gender, race, age [or] height of the mysterious developer,"" the creators of the project wrote on a website set up for the statue's debut.

The creation of the monument to the digital currency legend was led by Andras Gyofi, the editor of a Hungarian cryptocurrency news site, as well as other key players in the Central European nation's digital currency space.

The statue features a hoodie-clad figure constructed of bronze, but the face features a special bronze-aluminum composite so ""every visitor can see their own face when looking at Satoshi,"" the project organizers wrote. The art was the work of two Hungarian sculptors, Gergely Reka and Tamas Gilly, who decided to make the reflective face to represent a concept of ""We are all Satoshi.""

A global debate has ensued for years as to who the actual person or persons behind the iconic pseudonym is. Despite many people claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto -- and a handful of others being called him by investigative reporters -- the actual original author of the whitepaper that launched Bitcoin in 2008 has not been identified.

Given Bitcoin's meteoric rise over the past decade or so -- a single bitcoin worth about $600 five years ago now is worth more than $47,000 -- Satoshi Nakamoto may have become a billionaire as cryptocurrency became more mainstream. Earlier this month, El Salvador became the first nation in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.

The mythic nature of the Bitcoin creator only seems to lend to his revered status among crypto evangelists.

A large crowd turned out to view the unveiling of the statue on Thursday in Graphisoft Park, a business park in Hungary's capital city. The statue is available for public viewing, free of charge.

The sculpture's creators look at Bitcoin as ""much more"" than just a cryptocurrency, and said they sought to honor the ""very important legacy"" of its creator.

""The underlying technology, blockchain that Satoshi Nakamoto introduced to the world, can truly make our life better,"" they wrote on their website. ""Transparency, fairness, several other values in numerous fields, this is what blockchain truly means.""

The US government is preparing measures to make it more difficult for hackers to use crypto to profit from ransomware attacks.

The Treasury Department is planning sanctions against specific targets.

The actions come after high-profile ransomware attacks this year against Colonial Pipeline and meat packing company JBS.

The US government is working on a slate of actions to make it more difficult for hackers to use cryptocurrency to profit from ransomware attacks, with sanctions singling out specific targets due as early as next week, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

The Treasury Department plans to impose sanctions against specific targets, rather than blacklist an entire crypto infrastructure where ransomware transactions are suspected of occurring, unnamed sources told the publication. The department also plans to issue new guidance to businesses about risks associated with facilitating ransomware payments, including fines and other penalties.

The moves are the most significant so far by the Biden administration to step in and take some control of the digital finance ecosystem that cybersecurity experts say has fostered an increase in ransomware attacks in recent years, the report said.

Colonial Pipeline, a petroleum products handler, and JBS, the world's largest meat processor, are among this year's high-profile targets of hackers who used malicious software to disrupt the companies' operations and demand ransoms to be paid in crypto. The Department of Justice in June said it recovered $2.3 million worth of bitcoin out of a $4.4 million ransom that Colonial paid to DarkSide, the group that targeted Colonial, causing big fuel shortages and price hikes.

A Harris Poll survey released in June found a majority of American cryptocurrency owners said they're in favor of the government stepping up oversight of the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market to fight against ransomware attacks.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/6144a6b52257350018f756f0?format=jpeg',)",2 min read,"The hacking group REvil has launched ransomware attacks against hundreds of companies.

Ether's fair value is around $1,500 based on measures of network activity, a JPMorgan strategist has said.

That's roughly 55% lower than Friday's price of around $3,470 for ethereum's token.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said ethereum is facing growing smart-contract competition from other blockchains.

Ether's fair value is around $1,500 based on measures of network activity, a JPMorgan global market strategist has said. That's roughly 55% lower than Friday's price of around $3,470 for ethereum's token.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told Insider that the ethereum network is less attractive than the current price of ether suggests, as it's facing growing competition from blockchains such as solana and cardano.

Panigirtzoglou, who has become JPMorgan's crypto expert, said he and his team have looked at various measures of activity on the ethereum network to try to work out a fair value for the token.

JPMorgan reckons that a larger base of miners and users implies greater adoption and makes the network more attractive for product developers.

""We look at the hashrate and the number of unique addresses to try to understand the value for ethereum. We're struggling to go above $1,500,"" he said.

""There is a question mark here. The current price is expressing an exponential increase in usage and traffic that might not materialise.""

Ether - the cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain - has climbed more than 850% in price against the dollar over the last year during a widespread crypto boom.

Yet Panigirtzoglou told Insider recently that ethereum's key selling point - that developers can build decentralized apps and smart contracts upon it - ""can easily be replicated by other networks.""

""It's not unique,"" he said. ""You're already seeing competition from binance, competition from solana. And there are going to be more in the future."" Panigirtzoglou also cited cardano, which has recently upgraded to allow the creation of smart contracts.

However, Jack O'Holleran, CEO at ethereum development company Skale Labs, told Insider that ethereum is likely to remain the dominant decentralized finance blockchain, especially given upcoming network changes that should help it become larger and faster.

""The vast majority of smart contract developers are building in the ethereum ecosystem,"" O'Holleran said. ""Despite major partnerships being announced on other chains, we still see the absolute majority of (developers) being pulled into the ethereum vortex.""

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, uses crypto technology to create financial products that don't require centralized authorities. For example, they could enable trading without clearing houses or ""smart contracts"" that automatically pay out interest on loans.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/60642f1721887500193e84fc?format=jpeg',)",2 min read,"The cryptocurrency ether runs on the ethereum network.

2021-09-17,NDTV Gadgets 360,"Bitcoin Is Being Killed by Regulators in Countries Like India and China, Says Billionaire Ray Dalio",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/ray-dalio-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies-being-killed-by-regulators-in-india-china-2544545,"American billionaire Ray Dalio expressed concerns about countries like India and China strangling the growth of world's largest valued cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Speaking to the press earlier this week, the 72-year-old former co-chief investment officer of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, said he fears that if Bitcoin gets more popular, global regulators will try to kill the cryptocurrency. The business tycoon also said that despite not being totally onboard with digital currencies in the past, he has converted a portion of his portfolio into Bitcoin.

As per a report by portal CryptoPotato, Dalio feels that countries like India and China are trying to “get rid” of cryptocurrencies. While China has banned trading and transacting in digital currencies, India remains shaky in its approach towards securing the future of cryptos.

“I think at the end of the day if it (Bitcoin) is really successful, they (global regulators) will kill it, and they will try to kill it,” the report quoted Dalio as saying.

The famous investor further highlighted that people must have enough diversification in their portfolios before entering the crypto space given the constant market uncertainty. He has laid emphasis on investors keeping finances safe in the form of gold or other highly valued commodities.

Despite anti-crypto voices like that of Christine Lagarde, the president of European Central Bank questioning the credibility of cryptocurrencies, the digital finance tokens are witnessing fandom among global traders and investors.

The billionaire investor had last month said that Bitcoin was akin to digital gold. A constant evaluation of your investments is the key, according to Dalio. He further suggested avoiding buying an asset like Bitcoin just because of its temporary boom. “Be careful about what you're putting your money in⁠,” he said.

Earlier this month, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin a legal tender alongside the US dollar.

The decision was welcomed by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, who predicted that many more nations will follow the Central American country in adopting Bitcoin, which is the largest cryptocurrency in the world.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/cryptocurrency_mix_stock_pexels_1627728358830.jpg',)",2 min read,"American billionaire Ray Dalio expressed concerns about countries like India and China strangling the growth of world's largest valued cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

Its upcoming digital wallet, Novi, will be built upon the still-pending stablecoin Diem.

Diem is the cryptocurrency that grew out of Facebook’s in-house project that began in 2017 and was first known as Libra. After it was publicly revealed in 2018, the coin received intense scrutiny in Washington, DC, and around the industry.

The cryptocurrency project, rebranded as Diem, now operates as an independent association but retains close ties to Facebook. Facebook executive David Marcus straddles both worlds, sitting on Diem's board of directors and heading up Facebook Financial — which plans to launch Novi in the coming months.

This week, Marcus sat down with Yahoo Finance for a wide-ranging conversation for Influencers with Andy Serwer, a weekly series featuring biggest names in business, politics, entertainment, sports, and academia. Speaking to Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief, Andy Serwer, Marcus made the case for why Facebook still believes Diem is the right platform to build Facebook's new digital wallet around.

“We believe that in terms of consumer protections, both on the purpose built payments blockchain that Diem is and on the stablecoin itself, it’s in a class of its own,” Marcus says.

Diem digital wallet trying to ‘solve the systemic issues’

Marcus says it would have been easier to build the wallet to run on “existing rails.”

""As a matter of fact, a lot of people internally/externally have been puzzled by why we didn't do it that way,"" he added. But using existing rails, he said, “would actually not solve the systemic issues that we believe exists currently in our current payments infrastructure.”

Diem coins will be backed by a combination of cash or cash equivalents and short-term government securities, which Marcus says will keep them secure. Ultimately, he said, that is “much better than a current deposit with a traditional wallet here in the U.S.”

Story continues

Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Marcus also addressed initial concerns over whether Facebook’s coin had enough provisions to stop criminals who have gravitated to cryptocurrencies.

“I actually think and strongly believe that new infrastructure that enables more real time reporting to all of the right authorities at the right time,” Marcus says.

A number of other blockchains have improved their traceability, he acknowledged. But, he added, “I think in our case, we've taken it like really, really to a whole new level.”

A goal of launching Diem cryptocurrency 'before the end of this year'

Whether the industry agrees with Marcus’s outlook is yet to be seen. Libra has struggled to hold on to members with financial giants like Mastercard and Visa leaving the project in 2019.

Back then, Marcus often discussed the association’s goal of 100 members by launch, including in a Yahoo Finance interview at the time. Currently, the association lists 26 members on its site with the regulatory approval process still ongoing.

In a 2019 interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Cheung, Marcus insisted that Libra was ""absolutely not"" in jeopardy. Still, the launch date of the project was pushed back from 2020. Currently, Novi aims to launch before the end of the year along with Diem. Still, Marcus added in his most recent interview with Yahoo Finance, “We are definitely not going to launch without the proper regulatory framework.”

Between July 2020 and June 2021, Africa's cryptocurrency market grew by 1,200 percent – making up for a whopping $105.6 billion (roughly Rs. 775 crores), a recent report by Chainalysis said. Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania all rank among the top 20 countries on the Global Crypto Adoption Index, and together, the African nations represent the third most rapidly growing cryptocurrency market in the world. The report also noted that the bulk of these crypto transactions aren't driven by large institutional investors, but instead small and medium-sized retail buyers and businesses.

As per the report by market research firm Chainalysis, Africa records plenty of smaller transfer sizes indicating higher adoption of cryptocurrency trading at the grassroots level.

“Cross-region transfers also make up a bigger share of Africa's cryptocurrency market than any other region at 96 percent of all transaction volume, versus 78 percent for all regions combined,” the report said.

The study further observed that facilitating crypto payments using peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms is more popular in Africa, as compared to other countries. P2P platforms are online investment gateways that enable borrowers to attract lenders to identify and purchase loans that meet their investment criteria. Using these platforms, Africa-based crypto buyers and investors get into trading in digital currencies.

“Some countries, such as Nigeria and Kenya, have made it difficult for customers to send money to cryptocurrency businesses from their bank accounts, either by passing laws or simply by advising banks not to allow these transfers. However, this isn't an issue for P2P platforms, which are non-custodial and let customers trade cash for cryptocurrency amongst themselves,” Chainalysis explained.

For now, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, and Ukraine are sitting at the top four ranks of rapid crypto adoption. The rate of cryptocurrency adoption rose by 880 percent in 2020 in these regions, a report released earlier this month had claimed.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_disco_reuters_1622203490843.jpg',)",2 min read,"Cryptocurrency adoption in Africa is booming, according to a new report by cryptocurrency analysis firm Chainalysis.

A staggering 80% of the respondents do it to achieve better long-term returns on their money while almost half admit their decisions are influenced by the low interest rates in the traditional banking system.

The poll, the results of which have been quoted by the national broadcaster RTE and the Irish Independent, also shows that more than one in 10 of those questioned have put money into one crypto asset or another. The share of cryptocurrency investors grows to 25% of people aged 25 – 34. This group is the most open to saving in digital coins like bitcoin.

At the same time, stocks and shares have turned out to be the most preferred investment option for 19% of those surveyed. Government or corporate bonds, the Irish media reports reveal, are the second most popular asset among investors in the country.

The majority of 1,000 people who took part in the study, ordered by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), stated they use online resources to find investment-related information (62%). Among these are online banking or investment websites, financial news sites, blogs, and social media platforms. The rest, 38%, prefer to talk to an advisor from a bank or other financial institution.

Online investing options are even more popular among Irish investors under 35. Of this age group, 36% said they would use a trading platform or a mobile app such as Etoro or XTB, while 29% would employ an online financial services provider like Revolut, for example. Only 22% admitted they would invest through a bank or an investment company, and just 10% said they would refer to a broker.

“It is important that consumers are aware that investment products can often be highly complex, so it is essential consumers understand the type of product they are investing in,” said Grainne Griffin, Director of Communications at the CCPC, commenting on the findings in the survey. The commission is urging Irish investors to do their due research before spending any funds.

Griffin also warned that along with the potential for better returns, crypto investments come with higher risks than traditional financial products. Hers is not the first such warning issued in Ireland, with Central Bank Governor Gabriel Makhlouf being among those who have cautioned people that they could lose their money when investing in cryptocurrencies. However, Makhlouf has previously highlighted some of their positives as well, recently praising the “secure, decentralised” crypto technology.

The top leader of the Frankfurt, Germany-based bank spoke against the up-and-coming digital currencies while revealing her thoughts on if cryptos would prove to be beneficial for the global economy in the future. Lagarde's views on cryptocurrencies resonate those of several other central banks in the world. She also noted that crypto transactions consume high amounts of energy, and also said that cyrptocurrencies are not real currencies.

The statement by Lagarde, as reported by TechStory on Friday, comes at a time crypto trading has begun to pick pace around the world. Statistics platform CompareCamp reported that there are over 350,000 Bitcoin transactions daily, with an average of 14,904 every hour, or four transactions per second.

Lately, criticism of cryptocurrencies has heated up from countries like Russia and China. Governments of many countries like China, Russia, Morocco, and Bolivia among others have expressed concerns over the international transfers of these untraceable cryptocurrencies for notorious purposes that could pose danger to national safety.

Despite a recent report indicating growth in India, the future of cryptocurrencies remains uncertain in the country. Its government bill to the Parliament proposing a ban on digital currencies has been delayed. It was due in March 2021.

While over 150 countries including the UK, the US, India, and Canada allow crypto transactions and trading, Lagarde has slammed the companies that are pushing the adoption of cryptocurrencies.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/cryptocurrency_mix_stock_pexels_1627728358830.jpg',)",1 min read,"Christine Lagarde, the President of European Central Bank has termed cryptocurrencies as “highly speculative and suspicious” as she dismissed their credibility, according to reports.

2021-09-17,NDTV Gadgets 360,Dogecoin Price and Popularity Lands It at the Centre of a Trademark Battle: Details Here,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-dogecoin-trademark-battle-popularity-price-in-india-increase-shiba-inu-meme-coin-2543966,"Dogecoin saw a rapid rise earlier this year, gaining billions of dollars in market value on the back of a strong push from billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. But several other cryptocurrencies based on the same popular Shiba Inu meme also proliferated during the same time in a bid to ride the Dogecoin frenzy. The Dogecoin Foundation, a non-profit formed by the cryptocurrency's creators and supporters in 2014, has now filed an official claim with the US Patent and Trademark Office to make sure the brand name is not misused. The problem is, there are nearly half a dozen others who, too, are out to claim the name.

A trademark identifies the source of goods or services and provides legal protection for a brand. Originally created as a joke on the cryptocurrency universe and inspired by the 2013 viral Internet meme of a Shiba Inu dog, Dogecoin got massive support from Tesla and SpaceX CEO Musk and made impressive gains this year.

However, a battle has erupted over it and several players want to own the popular Dogecoin trademark, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal.

Among them is Moon Rabbit AngoZaibatsu, a Cook Islands-based company, which has filed a claim to obtain the Dogecoin trademark in the US and the European Union. Its founder Angel Versetti has created a new dogecoin on his company's blockchain network and also established another company in Cook Islands called the Dogecoin Foundation after the original Dogecoin Foundation remained inactive, said the report.

But the original Dogecoin Foundation was recently revived. Billy Markus, the co-creator of Dogecoin and one of the board advisors of the foundation, told Benzinga last month that he was concerned about “trademark trolling”, meaning some people trying to register a trademark without the intent of actually using it.

Dogecoin price in India was close to Rs. 20 (roughly $0.25) at the time of writing this report, up from less than a rupee ($0.01) at the beginning of this year.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/dogecoin_bloomberg_1613366194851.jpg',)",2 min read,"But several other cryptocurrencies based on the same popular Shiba Inu meme also proliferated during the same time in a bid to ride the Dogecoin frenzy.

2021-09-17,NDTV Gadgets 360,Cryptocurrency: Here’s How the Top 5 Coins Have Performed Since April 2021,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/cryptocurrency-price-bitcoin-ether-cardano-tether-ripple-btc-eth-ada-usdt-xrp-performance-fy-2021-april-1-2543981,"Cryptocurrencies saw a slow start this year, mainly due to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) order to banks telling them not to deal in crypto. The cryptocurrency trade accelerated after the Supreme Court in March reversed the RBI ban and allowed trading in coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and others. Since then, several online exchanges such as CoinSwitch Kuber and CoinDCX have flourished. But investing in these virtual assets require due diligence, given the extreme volatility of most cryptocurrencies. One way to do that is by looking at historical data of these coins.

How cryptocurrencies have behaved in the past few weeks and months can give an idea of their potential in the near future and whether a person should invest now or wait.

Here's how the top 5 digital coins have behaved so far since the start of this financial year (stating April 1):

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency in the world. Since its launch in 2009, it has remained an undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency market. On April 1 this year, it was trading around Rs. 42 lakhs but by May-end, around the time the market crashed massively because of a Chinese crackdown on mining operations, it hit a low of Rs. 22 lakhs. Bitcoin has, however, recovered. On September 17, it was trading around Rs. 37 lakhs.

Ethereum

Experts say this is the only virtual currency that has any chance of challenging Bitcoin's dominance, but it is far from realising its true potential. At the beginning of this financial year, Ethereum was trading at Rs. 1.40 lakhs. By early August, it breached the Rs. 2-lakh barrier. This was the time when the Ethereum blockchain had the major London upgrade. Since then, it has continued to gain in value. On September 17, at the time of writing, it was trading at Rs. 2.76 lakhs.

Cardano

Launched in 2017, Cardano is a relatively new cryptocurrency coin that has jumped the queue to find its place in the top five. Billed as a third-generation blockchain (Bitcoin and Ethereum being the first and second generations, respectively), Cardano gave returns of almost 150 percent in just one month. On July 20, it was trading at Rs. 79.71 but by August it had reached a high of Rs. 191.41. It registered more gains in the next few weeks, reaching an all-time high of Rs. 227 at the start of this month. But the gains have started to taper off since then. On September 17, at the time of writing, it was trading at Rs. 187.82.

Tether

Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Being the first one, it is the most popular stablecoin. Since it is pegged to the dollar, meaning every Tether coin should be backed by actual dollars in the reserves of Tether Limited, it is highly stable in comparison to other cryptocurrencies. If this stability is predictable, it also curbs the possibility of boosting wealth quickly. It has remained within the Rs. 73–75 range this financial year. It was trading around Rs. 77 on September 17.

Ripple

It's the fifth-placed cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation. Technically speaking, Ripple is not a cryptocurrency. It facilitates open-source payments and XRP is the cryptocurrency that runs on this network. Its price has doubled since April 1, from Rs. 41 to Rs. 80 now. But it has not seen a rally similar to that in late 2017 took it to its all-time high of Rs 242 in early January 2018. At the time of writing, it was trading around Rs. 84.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/cryptocurrency_mix_stock_pexels_1627728358830.jpg',)",3 min read,"The cryptocurrency trade accelerated after the Supreme Court in March reversed the RBI ban and allowed trading in coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and others.

Elon Musk is no stranger to making waves in the cryptocurrency market, and now the SpaceX and Tesla CEO is at again.

On September 13, Elon Musk shared to his personal Twitter account an image of his new pet, a very small Shiba Inu puppy. Musk stated in the post that ""Floki has arrived"", causing some cryptocurrency coins to have major spikes in value. The Floki Inu coin saw massive gains and other alternative coins with similar naming schemes such as Floki Shiba and Super Floki.

Both Floki Shiba and Super Floki saw a 150% rise in value. Musk has previously voiced his support for the most famous Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu Doge. Musk has even gone as far to say to that Dogecoin could one day become Earth's main currency. ""But fate loves irony... The most entertaining outcome is often the most likely and arguably the most entertaining outcome, and [the] most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth in the future"", said Musk earlier this year.

A longer trend for tokens like Bitcoin is still positive although we're still quite far from the highs in May. The recent drops might be linked to things like the fake news that Walmart was going to accept Litecoin — while this was quickly denied by all official sources, in a short period, the damage was done with a sudden price rise and an equally sudden drop.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, on Friday slipped by 0.65 percent in the last 24 hours, but this is still up from earlier this week, according to the Gadgets 360 Bitcoin Price History tracker. Bitcoin price in India was Rs. 37,23,736 at the time of writing this.

Ethereum price in India also dropped 2.84 percent, trading at Rs. 2,77,586. Although Ethereum has faced some challenges of late, it remains the most popular blockchain for use in NFTs which has certainly helped its value.

Dogecoin price in India, on the other hand, is up by 5.25 percent with its value crossing Rs. 20 again. In addition, Tether (USDT) is also up by +0.34 percent and is now trading at Rs. 78.32. As a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar, Tether's price, of course, is not as volatile as other cryptocurrencies.

Meanwhile, Uniswap Price has sunk by 5.21 percent and is trading at Rs. 2,020.76.

Cryptocurrency trading is picking pace around the world. Earlier this month, AMC Theatres said that it will accept Bitcoin for online ticket and concession payments, and similarly accept other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, which is likely to have a positive effect on the sentiment around crypto.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/cryptocurrency_mix_stock_pexels_1627728358830.jpg',)",2 min read,"A longer trend for tokens like Bitcoin is still positive although we're still quite far from the highs in May.

Popular altcoins including XRP, Cardano, Stellar, Chainlink, Uniswap, Polygon and Litecoin also encountered minor corrections due to weakness in trading volumes.

Commenting on the weakness, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto investment platform, said, “The crypto spectrum witnessed a minor consolidation over the past 24 hours.”

“The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ether, hovered around their local resistance levels of $48,000 and $3500, respectively. After Elon Musk's tweet on 'Floki', the SHIBA INU token rose more than 41 per cent,” he added.

Exchanges that have not registered must shut down services after September 24, while those that have registered but failed to secure partnerships with banks will be prohibited from trading in won.

""Should some or all services need to be closed, (exchanges) should notify customers of the expected closing date and procedures to withdraw money by at least seven days before the closure,"" the Financial Services Commision said earlier this week. It said this should be completed no later than September 17.

El Salvador this month became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, a move championed by the country's popular President Nayib Bukele. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 37.29 lakhs as of 11am IST on September 17.

The government has also launched a digital wallet, Chivo, which is linked to newly-built cryptocurrency cash machines that allow users to withdraw physical money from their digital Bitcoin holdings. Its roll out has been plagued by glitches.

The Court of Accounts, which can impose administrative and asset sanctions against officials who cannot solve shortcomings, said it received a complaint on September 10 from a regional human rights and transparency organisation, Cristosal, about Bitcoin implementation in El Salvador.

Cristosal requested an audit of the authorisation processes for the purchase of Bitcoins and to review the construction of the booths used for the ATMs linked to the digital wallet of Chivo, a company established with public resources.

Cristosal's complaint was against six members of the Board of Directors of the Bitcóin Trust, consisting of members of the Finance and Economy ministries, as well as the secretariat of Commerce and Investments.

""Having admitted the complaint, it will be proceeded to carry out the legal analysis report and, in a timely manner, forward such report to the General Audit Coordination,"" the Court of Accounts said in an official document reviewed by Reuters.

One Cristosal official, who was not authorised to speak about the matter, confirmed the complaint has been accepted.

On top of sanctioning officials, the Court of Accounts is empowered to present notices to the Attorney General's Office to initiate criminal proceedings in case it finds irregularities in their investigations.

President Bukele's government did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has made Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people of 2021. The programmer was listed as an innovator, and Time valued his ability to empower other creators with his continued support for Ethereum and all the things that its prime feature, smart contracts, can help them accomplish.

Vitalik Buterin in Time’s Top 100 Influencers

The most famous Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has been included in Time’s top 100 influential people of 2021 list. The magazine lists the most important people according to current events and specifies the unique roles of the individuals on the list. Others included for 2021 are Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, who pushed the inclusion of Bitcoin as legal tender, and Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, who is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast.

Alexios Ohanian, one of the original builders of Reddit, discussed Buterin’s inclusion this year, saying:

What makes Vitalik so special, though, is that he is a builder’s builder. No one person could’ve possibly come up with all of the uses for Ethereum, but it did take one person’s idea to get it started. From there, a new world has opened up, and given rise to new ways of leveraging blockchain technology—some of which I’ve invested in.

Ethereum Is a Platform for Platforms

This year, Ethereum has been the hotbed for the rise of NFTs, a technology that is changing how artists and creators monetize their work. Opensea, one of the main NFT markets, has already surpassed the one-billion-dollar mark in sales. Another important Ethereum-based project that has risen this year is Axie Infinity. Axie was created in 2017, but it is now in the spotlight due to the impressive income some are achieving by playing it. Axie is making a big impact in emerging economies like the Philippines and Venezuela.

Ohanian, who wrote the review for Buterin, also makes reference to some important projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. He stressed:

Whether it’s startups like Sorare reinventing fantasy sports or Rainbow users showing off their NFT collections, none of this would’ve existed without Vitalik’s creation. I’ve never been more excited about the potential of the Internet, and that’s largely thanks to Vitalik Buterin.

Ethereum is now hovering over the $3,500 mark, up 4.3% in the last 24 hours.

Blockchain-based music streaming platform Audius raised $5 million in a strategic round of funding from some of the top names in the music industry.

Artist investors in Audius include Katy Perry, Nas, The Chainsmokers via their Mantis VC, Jason Derulo, Pusha T, Steve Aoki, Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda, and Disclosure, Decrypt reported.

The platform that claims to have nearly six million monthly active users is a decentralized music streaming application owned and run by an open source community of artists, fans, and developers. It also lets musicians upload their tracks with no costs. Unlike other platforms like Spotify and Souncloud, Audius lets artists own their music. Each song uploaded on the platform has a time stamp record of origin.

Artists have already moved in the crypto industry through investments and even showcasing their Non Fungible Token (NFT) collections. For example, Rapper Nas was one of the early investors in cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase.

“I’ve known that blockchain will change the world since I invested in Coinbase five years ago and I believe it might be the most important technology to ever hit the music industry,” Nas said in the statement. “Everyone who uploads to Audius can be an owner, you can't say that about any other platform.”

Audius had last raised $3.1 million in July 2020 in a strategic round co-led by Multicoin Capital and Blockchange Ventures, with participation from Pantera Capital, Collab+Currency, and Coinbase Ventures.

Marc Filippino

Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Friday, September 17th, and this is your FT News Briefing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Marc Filippino

The FT has its hands on an unpublished European Central Bank inflation estimate. We’ll tell you what we found. And Myanmar’s shadow government is fighting back against the military junta. Plus, our markets editor Katie Martin is back. Talk with her about the latest developments in the world of crypto.

Katie Martin

You can say what you like about crypto, but if you know what you’re doing, if you can ride the wave up, but also protect yourself on the pretty serious pullbacks, then you can make an absolute shitload of money.

Marc Filippino

I’m Marc Filippino. And here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Marc Filippino

Unpublished documents seen by the FT suggest that the European Central Bank expects to hit its two per cent inflation target by 2025, and it could raise eurozone interest rates in just over two years. That is a year earlier than most economists expected. Right now, the ECB’s key deposit rate is at half per cent below zero. It’s been negative since 2014 and most analysts believed it would stay that way until around 2024. That’s because the ECB has been struggling to boost prices. But last month, eurozone inflation hit a decade high of three per cent. The internal models that FT had access to may likely add to the debate about how quickly central banks should reverse their pandemic stimulus programmes and raise rates.

Marc Filippino

In Myanmar, supporters of the arrested leader Aung San Suu Kyi have formed a shadow government, and last week it declared war against the military junta, which took power in a coup in February. The junta has killed dozens of people and torched villages in response to escalating guerrilla attacks on government troops and telecom towers. Here’s the FT’s John Reed.

John Reed

I think it’s become pretty clear that peaceful protest has done nothing to reverse the coup or to stop the regime from using horrific violence against civilians. The anti-junta camp are also getting frustrated with the international community’s inability to do anything constructive to resolve this crisis.

Marc Filippino

John, why are the anti-junta forces attacking telecoms towers? What’s the strategy behind that?

John Reed

It was very much symbolic. They were attacking only the towers of one company, which is Mitel, and that’s the joint venture telco between the Myanmar military and the Vietnamese company Viettel. So they were in the PDFs, saw this as an attack on a regime target. And it also I went to the company, I asked Mitel what kind of impact it had on their services, and they told me it knocked out telecoms availability for about 700,000 people. So that’s that’s not nothing.

Marc Filippino

Marc Filippino

The cryptocurrency universe seems to be expanding by the week, even as regulators issue warnings of clampdowns. With me to discuss the latest crypto developments is Katie Martin, our markets editor. Welcome back, Katie.

Katie Martin

Hey, Marc. How you doing?

Marc Filippino

I’m good, thanks. So can I ask what’s your favourite crypto news from this week?

Katie Martin

Well, I mean, where do you want me to start?

Marc Filippino

Yeah, there’s been quite a bit.

Katie Martin

(Laughter) There is never a dull moment. There’s always something to keep us on our toes. One of the developments I’ve been writing about recently regards Laos — communist country with like seven million inhabitants. It has authorised mining and trading in crypto. And that’s kind of funny because it comes not long after officials at the central bank and what-not advised people to steer clear of cryptocurrencies. But there’s been some sort of change of heart for whatever reason. Now, one of the really good reasons why Laos could get into crypto mining is that it has a surplus of hydropower. So one of the big criticisms that people levelled against crypto is that it uses up an awful lot of coal in power stations to power up the computers that mine this stuff. And if you can hook it up instead to hydropower, which Laos has in abundance, then you can do it with a much greener footprint, for want of a better word. There’s not a lot of tourism going on at the moment. So this is a good way for the country to use up some of its surplus power. So, yeah, quite a change of heart over there.

Marc Filippino

Now, aside from Laos, more broadly speaking, how are crypto assets performing in comparison to other assets, equities, currencies, things like that?

Katie Martin

Well, if you look at crypto hedge funds, so it’s not that many crypto hedge funds, right? But there are some that specialise in digital assets and in crypto and they are killing it. Absolutely killing it. So they made 24 per cent in August. They’re up 145 per cent so far this year. You can say what you like about crypto, but if you know what you’re doing, if you can ride the wave up, but also protect yourself on the pretty serious pullbacks that you see in the bitcoin price, for example, then you can make an absolute shitload of money. And a lot of the funds are doing this. I mean, what hedge funds are telling us is that there’s plenty of volatility in crypto so you can make money on the way up and on the way down if you know what you’re doing. And there’s also a lot of inefficiency. So you see big differences in prices between different exchanges. And that means if you can play one off against the other, then you can again, it’s an opportunity to make some money. So there is a school of thought that hedge funds that have turned their nose up at crypto might actually find themselves getting more demand to participate in the crypto market if these if these returns are out there.

Marc Filippino

So I wanna talk about an aspect of cryptocurrency that we’ve discussed on the show before, and that’s how it’s become popular with criminals. They use it for money laundering, among other things. What are brokers and banks doing to help crypto exchanges stop criminals?

Katie Martin

So that is precisely what regulators are trying to figure out. They can’t really control what happens on the blockchain and you know, who mines what coin and who sells it to who for how much money. But what they can potentially do is take more control of what you call on and off ramps. So any time that you want to put traditional currencies on to a crypto exchange or get it off again, then that’s the point at which traditional banks and the traditional financial system has a responsibility and answers to regulators. And this is kind of one of the pinch points where regulators could take action if they think that there is bad behaviour. But it’s very difficult for regulators in some jurisdictions and with some companies to really get a handle on what is going on. But certainly they are looking very closely at where crypto intersects with illicit activity, with things that look and smell like money laundering. All of the global authorities have been very vocal about this recently. It’s definitely picking up volume.

Marc Filippino

Katie Martin is our markets editor. Thanks as always, Katie.

Katie Martin

No problem.

Before we go, a word from the investment adviser Roaring Kitty.

Clip of Keith Gill

Well, what up? The game Southeast is a super simple, but it’s often misunderstood everyone. . . .

Marc Filippino

Roaring Kitty is actually Keith Gill. He was an insurance company employee. His job was making educational materials for clients. He was also trading stocks and making videos encouraging people to buy shares in the video game retailer GameStop.

Clip of Keith Gill

And that, like GameStop, isn’t a cigar butt. It’s more of a roach, right? That last hit might not be the prettiest or the cleanest, but it could get the job done, if you know what I mean.

Marc Filippino

And with advice like that, Gill became a star of the amateur trading boom. Some accused him of pumping up the stock price. He was even called to testify before US lawmakers. So who’s paying the price now? Not Gill. Regulators in his home state of Massachusetts fined Gill’s former employer, the insurance company MassMutual, for four million dollars. They said the company failed to oversee Gill and other agents in their use of social media or review excessive trading in their personal accounts. MassMutual did not admit or deny the findings.

China is ramping up its hunt for illegal cryptocurrency miners, who are trying to disguise their operations as research institutions and data centres, according to a new report.

Authorities in several provinces have conducted more intense inspections of colleges, research labs, data centres and other potential sites that could be hiding crypto mines, Bloomberg reported.

China’s government has framed its ongoing crackdown on crypto as an effort to reduce the country’s carbon emissions. The recent escalation is in part due to authorities’ concerns about power supplies ahead of cold winter weather, according to the report.

Some Chinese crypto mining tycoons have fled the country for Kazakhstan, Canada, the state of Texas and other areas with cheap power and friendlier laws. Other crypto users have been locked up on fraud and money laundering charges.

But crypto miners who remain in China have become increasingly resourceful in evading authorities, according to Bloomberg.

Authorities in several provinces have conducted more intense inspections of colleges, research labs, data centres and other potential sites that could be hiding crypto mines.

One unnamed miner told the outlet that he regularly moves his mining rigs between locations to make his activity harder for authorities to trace.

In a Wednesday statement, authorities in the Chinese province of Hebei urged companies to “strictly prevent the use of system computing power to engage in illegal virtual currency mining.”

“Virtual currency mining consumes huge energy, which runs counter to my country’s goal of ‘carbon neutrality and carbon peak,’” government groups in the province said.

“Its proliferation and spread will seriously affect economic and social development and directly threaten national security.”

China had been responsible for about 46 percent of crypto mining around the globe before the government’s crackdown, which began around May of this year and helped send bitcoin’s price tumbling from its April peak of about $65,000 to less than $33,000 by June.

But bitcoin has somewhat recovered since June, trading higher than $52,000 in early September.

However, the global market cap of Bitcoin on Friday stood at $900.47 billion. On the other hand, the rival currency of Bitcoin, Ethereum, was also trading in the red zone, down 0.53 per cent at $3568.72. In the list of names, speaking about the bright prospect of Bitcoin, the new entrant is Austrian investor and fund manager Ronald-Peter Stoeferle who said the sentiment for gold is already so negative that it may soar to new all-time highs in the next few months. About cryptocurrency, Stoeferle, managing partner at Incrementum AG, said if Bitcoin is there for the next 5 to 10 years, it may touch a level “we cannot currently imagine”. Stoeferle was asked whether he feels that gold is dead and if cryptocurrency like Bitcoin has played a role in undermining the precious metal? He said the global financial markets have reached a “monetary tipping point”.

The global crypto market cap is $2.17 trillion, a 0.84 per cent decrease over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $110.92 billion, which makes a 10.80 per cent increase. The total volume in DeFi is currently $20.46 billion, 18.45 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins is now $86.78 billion, which is 78.24 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. Bitcoin’s dominance is currently 41.57 per cent, an increase of 0.19 per cent over the day.

“Beginning last week, Ethereum formed a distinctive double bottom pattern indicating an upward cycle in the shorter time period. Ethereum, to a greater extent, has managed to recover from a critical level of support, which could potentially see an upswing towards $5,000 levels. The total ETH available on different trading platforms has also seen a considerable dip. This short supply again indicates a definitive price upside.” Siddharth Menon, COO, WazirX said.

Menon, throwing light, said, the Altcoin market is expected to follow the Ethereum trend cycle. Litecoin(LTC), after the recent Walmart debacle, has slowly started to indicate a pattern breakout. LTC would be one of the cryptocurrencies which will be accepted by AMC, one of the world’s largest chain of movie theatres. This only strengthens the overall belief that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are here to stay and will see a brighter future. decentralized and is her""

Cardano was also trading $2.41, down 1.96 per cent. However, the market cap of Cardano was $77,45 billion. Binance was trading at $419.59, down 1.74 per cent.

“The past 24 hours witnessed some consolidation across the crypto spectrum. After two consecutive days of rally, the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation consolidated around the resistance levels. Bitcoin fell lower after touching the $48,000 mark, and Ether faced pullback around the $3600 mark. Cardano continued to remain under bearish dominance as it struggled to go past the $2.50 mark. Among the top 30 cryptos by market capitalization, Avalanche and Luna were the showstoppers. As the markets entered the weekend on a high note, the temporary consolidation would not bother the crypto investors. Over the weekend, we could witness some drastic moves among the two largest cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum,"" Edu Patel, CEO and Co-founder, Mudrex- A Global Crypto Trading Platform said.

According to Patel, the total crypto market cap settled marginally lower at around $2.18 trillion, and the total traded volumes clocked gains of 8.2 per cent . It signals that several crypto traders attempted to book profits before the weekend. The weekend could eventually turn out to be bullish, as most of the largest cryptocurrencies are consolidating near the local support levels.

A committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has proposed to subject cryptocurrencies to the “wash sale” rule. Since cryptocurrencies are treated as property by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), they are currently not subject to the wash sale rule. This proposal attempts to close down a big crypto tax loophole.

Crypto Included in New Proposal

The Committee on Ways and Means, the chief tax-writing committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, proposed to subject cryptocurrencies to the wash sale rule Monday. If adopted, the rules will apply to crypto trades occurring after Dec. 31.

The “wash sales” provision in the bill states:

This section includes commodities, currencies, and digital assets in the wash sale rule, an anti-abuse rule previously applicable to stock and other securities. The wash sale rule in section 1091 prevents taxpayers from claiming tax losses while retaining an interest in the loss asset.

The wash-sale rule was designed to discourage people from selling securities at a loss simply to claim a tax benefit. A wash sale occurs when an individual sells a security at a loss and then purchases that same security or substantially identical securities within 30 days.

Shehan Chandrasekera, head of Tax Strategy at crypto tax software firm Cointracker, commented that with this wash sale proposal, the committee “is trying to close down a big crypto tax loophole.” He elaborated:

Since cryptocurrencies are treated as property (IRS 2014-21), they are not subject to the wash sale rule. This allows you to harvest losses more aggressively in crypto than in stocks. You don’t have to wait 30 days. Ways & Means Committee is trying to subject crypto to the wash sale rule.

According to Chandrasekera, “the new rules will not eliminate the tax benefit, it will defer the tax benefit.”

On September 8, 2021, Dmitriy Berenzon, research partner at 1kxnetwork, an early-stage crypto fund that helps founders bootstrap token networks, published a comprehensive research post concerning blockchain bridges. Berenzon’s study highlights the current “multi-chain market structure” and bridges that are making a myriad of blockchains compatible.

Researcher: ‘We Are Finally in a Multi-Chain Market Structure’

For quite some time now, multi-chain or cross-chain technology has been a holy grail of sorts in the cryptocurrency development space. People want to transact with other blockchains by leveraging bridges to different ecosystems.

Dmitriy Berenzon published a detailed article about the subject of cross-chain tech and bridges, and he believes we’ve finally reached a watershed moment. “After years of research & development, we are finally in a multi-chain market structure,” Berenzon stresses in his blog post.

Berenzon’s study looks at blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, Avalanche, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, Cosmos, and more. The researcher notes that “interoperability unlocks innovation” as he highlights that “bridges are important because they enable users to access new platforms, protocols to interoperate with each other, and developers to collaborate on building new products.”

Moreover, Berenzon lists the many benefits of cross-chain interoperability like leveraging the tech for external validators and federations. Also, using the tech for light clients and relay protocols alongside the ability to access liquidity networks.

However, Berenzon’s report is not just a fluff piece about fintech, and he highlights that cross-chain tech and bridges are an “incredibly difficult problem in distributed systems.” He adds that things like finality and rollbacks need to be addressed, NFT transfers and provenance, alongside stress testing these blockchain bridges over time.

$7.7 Billion Locked Across 8 Bridges to Ethereum

In addition to Berenzon’s insights, statistics from Dune Analytics’ dashboard called “Bridge Away” measure bridge volume tethered to the various chains and Ethereum. In terms of Ethereum bridge relative total value locked (TVL) stats, the Polygon ERC20 Bridge has approximately $2.4 billion in TVL on September 16, 2021.

Polygon’s bridge represents 32.5% of the TVL across eight bridges. The bridges recorded include the Polygon ERC20 Bridge, Arbitrum Bridges, Avalanche Bridge, Solana Wormhole, Fantom Anyswap Bridge, Harmony Bridges, Optimism ERC20 Bridges, and Near Rainbow Bridge.

Across all of these bridges mentioned, there’s $7.79 billion TVL spread across 42,997 unique addresses during the last 30 days. Arbitrum Bridges command 31.5% of the aggregate TVL and the Avalanche Bridge has around 21.2% today.

Solana Wormhole’s TVL is about 6.7% and the Fantom Anyswap Bridge has around 6.6% of the $7.79 billion TVL. Ether and WETH are the top assets held in TVL with $2.9 billion recorded on September 16. USDC is the second leading asset held in bridge TVL with $1.2 billion recorded. This is followed by wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) which has just over a billion dollars held in the overall bridge TVL aggregate total.

What do you think about multi-chain or cross-chain bridge technology and the expanding TVL held by these protocols? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

On August 5, 2021, the Ethereum network and its participants successfully completed the highly anticipated London upgrade, which saw the implementation of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559. Since then, 303,681 ether worth more than a billion U.S. dollars have been burned.

More Than 300K Ether Burned Following EIP-1559

More than a billion dollars worth of ethereum (ETH) has been burned to date, after the London upgrade was implemented 42 days ago. The biggest changes added to the Ethereum blockchain included EIP-1559 and EIP-3554. While EIP-3554 changed the difficulty bomb, EIP-1559 changed Ethereum’s fee rate to a new scheme that makes the crypto asset ether deflationary.

Essentially, fees are standardized and calculated based on network demand, as a transaction pricing mechanism introduces a base fee for every block found on the network. The remainder of the fees will be burned and ether proponents assume this will significantly reduce the overall supply of ethereum. As of today, September 16, 2021, the Ethereum network has burned 303,681 ether worth over $1 billion using Thursday’s ether exchange rates.

Opensea Still Largest Burner, Stablecoin Transfers Add to the Burn Pile

The biggest burners in the network are people transferring ether from one address to another and decentralized applications (dapps) and decentralized finance (defi) platforms as well. The largest ether burner today is the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Opensea as Dune Analytics stats show the market has burned 42,991 ether worth $146.1 million today. Opensea is followed by traditional ether transfers which have added 25,514 ether to the burn pile.

Uniswap V2 and the stablecoin project Tether (USDT) command the third and fourth positions in terms of the top ether burners. To date, the second version of the Uniswap decentralized exchange (dex) has burned 16,665 ether worth $55.8K. Tether’s stablecoin USDT has added 15,015 ether to the burn pile as it is responsible for burning $51 million. Other top burners include Axie Infinity, Uniswap V3, Metamask, the stablecoin project USDC, and Opensea’s registry.

2021-09-17,US News Money,Should You Invest in Solana (SOL)?,https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/should-you-invest-in-solana-sol,"Thanks in large part to low transaction fees, Solana has emerged as one of Ethereum's main competitors. (Getty Images)

Solana may be becoming a victim of its own success. The cryptocurrency had been red hot lately, with backers calling it ""Solana summer"" thanks to the token's scorching gains. On Tuesday, Sept. 14, however, Solana – whose ticker on crypto exchanges is SOL – faced major network instability issues. The organization's Twitter account blamed ""resource exhaustion,"" in part caused by an unusually large number of transactions on the network.

This unexpected activity flooded the network and caused it to malfunction. The failure resembled a distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attack, though it's unclear who, if anyone, was behind the outage. The price of Solana fell as much as 15% that day in response to the negative news.

In the grand scheme of things, however, this is arguably the best sort of problem that an emerging cryptocurrency could face. Too much network activity speaks to Solana's incredible success that it has had in attracting developers, decentralized finance, or DeFi, projects and end users to the platform in just a matter of months. Solana has leveraged that growing user buzz into one of the year's most impressive price charts. Even with the recent sell-off, SOL is up approximately 1,000% over the past six months.

Recent network outages notwithstanding, why has Solana generated so much buzz in the crypto community and become one of the top 10 tokens by market capitalization? And should you invest in Solana?

How Ethereum and Solana Are Disrupting Finance

For a long time, Bitcoin was the undisputed champion of the cryptocurrency arena. Over the past year, however, the value of Ethereum has appreciated sharply compared to Bitcoin. This is, in large part, because of a highly active developer community and an ever-increasing number of applications built on Ethereum. Ethereum has led the way in offering smart contracts, DeFi, nonfungible tokens, known as NFTs, and more.

Bitcoin retains a large loyal fan base due to its first-mover advantage and powerful brand. However, as far as actual usefulness in financial transactions goes, Ethereum has become the dominant force lately.

Here's where Solana enters the picture. Solana has become one of the main rivals to Ethereum. Others have certainly tried. Cardano, for example, may theoretically solve many of the issues with resource usage and high transaction fees that currently limit Ethereum. But Cardano has rolled out smart contracts and other advanced features at a slow pace.

Solana, by contrast, has had no issues converting its technological promise into tangible results. Blake Richman, senior portfolio manager at Sarson Funds, highlighted the activity on Solana. ""There's nearly 400 dApps (decentralized applications) on Solana now; similar to what you would find on Ethereum, including DeFi, NFTs and gaming. There's now nearly $12 billion locked in DeFi applications on Solana, growing from $2 billion in 30 days,"" Richman says.

Solana has made particular inroads with NFTs. Its Degenerate Ape collection of art, for example, has been a huge hit. Some Degenerate Ape NFTs have sold for more than $1 million each. And that's far from the only social activity gaining popularity on Solana. ""It feels like there is a new NFT minting event on Solana every day, and there are a few hotly anticipated blockchain-based games being released on Solana, such as Star Atlas,"" Richman says.

A big reason why Solana is exploding in popularity is due to its rock-bottom transaction fees. Ben Weiss, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin ATM operator CoinFlip, noted that the average transaction cost on Solana is only $0.00025. That's orders of magnitude cheaper than Ethereum and other leading cryptocurrencies. ""The ability to transact so quickly and cheaply sets Solana apart from the pack in many ways,"" Weiss says.

This has become a pivotal issue this year as so-called ""gas"" fees to use the Ethereum network have exploded. While Ethereum still works well enough for bigger smart contracts or NFT purchases, it has put a damper on many types of commerce.

For applications such as gaming and micropayments, Ethereum's current fee structure won't cut it. The Ethereum community has a roadmap in place to try to relieve this obstacle. For now, though, there's a big opportunity to take market share from Ethereum. Solana is making the most of the opportunity, and that's a major reason the SOL coin price has been rallying.

SOL: More Than Just Low Fees

Solana has some other things going for it as well. While its developer community is still much smaller than Ethereum's, Solana's easy-to-use Rust programming language could help drive further community adoption. The combination of low fees and a quicker learning curve could be the winning combination. ""As blockchains currently stand, Solana is the most efficient by the majority of metrics,"" Weiss says.

That upbeat take isn't an isolated view. Josh Goodbody is the chief operating officer of Qredo and previously served as Europe, Middle East and Africa director at Binance. Goodbody also sees SOL as a strong competitor to Ethereum. ""Solana's hallmarks are speed of transactions and low gas fees, due to an innovative proof-of-history protocol. Thanks to this powerful infrastructure, they have raised over $300 million this year from the likes of a16z and Polychain,"" Goodbody says.

Goodbody presciently warned that Solana would need to decentralize further and obtain more network validators. This weakness came to light recently in the wake of Solana's widespread network problems. Despite that, with its strong backers and fast transaction network, Solana has a good shot at bouncing back.

Not everyone is so enamored with Solana, however. Andrew Keys, co-founder and managing partner at Darma Capital, sees Ethereum retaining its market-leading position.

""The work that Solana has done and the technology they have developed is cool, but they have made important trade-offs to do it, offering a more centralized solution akin to a traditional server. Solana will work well for a number of use cases, but ultimately, the base layer for the majority of DeFi and Web3 will be Ethereum amplified by layer 2 (scaling solutions),"" Keys says.

While investors should heed that cautionary note, there's still a lot to like about SOL. ""The future for Solana is exciting, as its speed and low fees provide a better user experience. Further, Solana may ultimately be a better environment for certain financial applications that require high rates of transactions or data transference,"" Richman says.

Solana is recovering from a large and embarrassing technical problem with its network. If its engineers can't improve network stability, the value proposition for the SOL coin could be impaired. Still, this seems like the sort of growing pain that a rapidly expanding network would face.","('https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/086f5e2/2147483647/crop/2000x1334%2B0%2B2/resize/970x647/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Ff7%2F3e%2F4a9331b3481eae803cc754586955%2Finvestingphone.jpg',)",5 min read,"Thanks in large part to low transaction fees, Solana has emerged as one of Ethereum's main competitors.

“He really convinced me this was something I needed to do,” Cohen, the founder of Point72 Asset Management and owner of the New York Mets, said on Tuesday at the Sky­bridge Alternatives Conference, according to a person with knowledge of his remarks. That was part of a journey that included meeting with as many people over the past six months as he could to educate himself.

“Once I decided there were opportunities, and I thought this could be a space like the internet — it could be incredibly transformational — I wasn’t go­ing to miss this,” Cohen said in a discussion titled “Genera­t­ing Alpha in Markets and Base­ball” moderated by Sky­bridge Cap­i­t­­al founder Anthony Scaramucci.

Cohen, 65, who has a net worth of $11.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has since thrown himself into the world of crypto in a personal capacity and at his firm.

This week, he announced he was investing in Radkl, a quantitative trading firm for digital assets. That was after Recur, a non-fungible token company, said Cohen’s family office also invested in its latest funding round. Cohen, meanwhile, told Scaramucci that Point72 is building crypto-trading capabilities at the firm.

His interest in the virtual realm extends beyond crypto: Cohen expressed a fascination with the metaverse, or a vision of a virtual world where people interact through avatars.

“There’s some far-out ideas out there, about how people are going to spend their time,” he said. “Your mind can run wild,” he added, about how people will interact in the metaverse, potentially buying virtual real estate and virtual outfits for their avatars.

Cohen, a Mets fan who bou­ght the team in December for about $2.5 billion, also add­ressed the club’s performance and why he loves owning it.

“It’s taken me into a different realm,” Cohen said. “Own­ing a hedge fund, you have some notoriety, but it’s nothing like owning a sports team in New York.” He weighed in on the world of social media, where he has been more vocal since acquiring the Mets, saying it has helped people to see him as a human being, and not just a wealthy hedge fund owner.","('https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2018-04/18/full/1524071449-7465.jpg',)",2 min read,"Hedge fund billionaire was until recently a bit of a skeptic when it came to Then his son, a “cryptomaniac”, helped change his mind.

NEW DELHI: The world of cryptocurrencies is very dynamic. Research paper ‘Distrust or Speculation? The socioeconomic drivers of US cryptocurrency investments’, published in July 2021 reveals many useful findings about the sociodemographics of cryptocurrency usage in the US.The research conducted by Raphael Auer of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and David-Tercero Lucas of the Autonomous University underscored following important conclusions in the American context:* The research found that men have a higher propensity to invest in cryptocurrency than women. A gender gap was seen in terms of cryptocurrency ownership.* Levels of education and income, digital financial experience gained from using debit and credit cards, using a mobile app to pay for products also played an important role in orienting the choice of cryptocurrency.- Owners of XRP and ether are the most educated ones, followed by Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin users.- Owners of XRP, Ether and Stellar are the highest earners while Bitcoin investors earn the least.- Litecoin owners are the least educated.* Gender and age were found to be unrelated to differences in knowledge about crypto technology.* Owning a cryptocurrency in one year increases the probability of owning a cryptocurrency in the next year by 50 percent on the basis of an empirical test hodling, which is a misspelling of the word holding means buying and holding cryptocurrency for a longer period.* Cryptocurrencies are not treated as alternatives to fiat currency but rather as a niche digital speculation object.The research done by Auer and Tercero used the Federal Reserve’s survey data as base. The pool of investors in cryptocurrencies in the US has increased dramatically by 2020 with nearly 4 per cent Americans having cryptos in their portfolio than 1.4 per cent in 2019 as per Federal Reserve survey.Charles Randell, the chair of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, had warned that the hype and frenzy surrounding digital currencies could lure customers into such fraudulent investments and thus the need for regulation. The crux of the research by the Auer-Tercero duo is also to have cryptocurrency regulations since the objectives of investors in cryptocurrency are the same as those for the asset classes.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-86270887,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108252,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",2 min read,"Cryptocurrency Live Previous Next(For the latest crypto news, investment tips and real-time price updates, follow our.)

According to Cuba’s official state news agency Prensa Latina, the order became official on Wednesday.

With crypto legally recognized by the BCC, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can now be used for commercial transactions and investments in Cuba.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the central bank first announced plans to recognize and regulate crypto back in late August.

Indeed, Resolution 215 of 2021 contains provisions for a licensing regime for crypto exchanges and other virtual asset service providers operating in Cuba.

Despite legalizing the use of crypto assets in Cuba, the BCC has warned of the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.

According to the BCC, while crypto operates outside of the nation’s banking system, the use of virtual currencies poses significant monetary policy risks and financial stability concerns.

Cuba’s central bank also warned of the potential for bad actors to take advantage of the perceived anonymous nature of crypto transactions for illicit transactions.

By recognizing crypto, Cubans may begin to enjoy easier remittance flows from overseas despite the United States embargo. Global money transfer services like Western Union have largely exited the country under increasing pressure from Washington.

Indeed, the country is towing a similar line to El Salvador in embracing Bitcoin amid crippling U.S. sanctions and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. El Salvador recently became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.

Crypto interest in Cuba has been high over the last few years with virtual currencies associated with the possibility of financial freedom for many in the country.

The world’s largest movie exhibition company, AMC Entertainment, has announced its plan to accept cryptocurrencies by year-end. AMC CEO Adam Aron says the entertainment giant will accept bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and bitcoin cash.

AMC Prepares to Accept Cryptocurrencies

AMC, the largest movie exhibition company in the U.S., Europe, and the world, has unveiled its plan to accept cryptocurrencies by the end of the year. As of March 31, AMC owned or operated approximately 950 theaters and 10,500 screens globally.

AMC CEO Adam Aron tweeted Wednesday:

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts: you likely know @AMCTheatres has announced we will accept bitcoin for online ticket and concession payments by year-end 2021. I can confirm today that when we do so, we also expect that we similarly will accept ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash.

AMC unveiled its plan to accept bitcoin during an earnings call in August. The CEO detailed on Twitter at the time: “By year end, we will have the technology in place to use Apple Pay and Google Pay in our online ticketing, and in a breakthrough, we also expect by year end to accept payment online in bitcoin. That’s a historic step for AMC.”

His tweet continues: “I see that many of you are crypto enthusiasts. AMC is pleased to get out in front, by planning to accept payment online in bitcoin.” Aron clarified:

If it remains safe and reliable to use, it would seem that cryptocurrency will get even more important in future years.

2021-09-17,The Guardian Nigeria,"Nigerian crypto traders to withdraw, deposit funds soon",https://guardian.ng/news/nigerian-crypto-traders-to-be-able-to-withdraw-deposit-funds-soon-luno/,"x

“We are pleased to announce that we have approved a solution to enable our customers to withdraw and deposit Naira again on Luno. This will be available on our platform in the coming weeks,” Luno said in an email on Thursday.

Luno’s update comes eight months after it halted naira deposit and withdrawal for Nigerian cryptocurrency traders.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) ban on cryptocurrency forced changes on the operations of Luno and other Nigerian fintech companies into cryptocurrency trading.

CBN directed all DMBs, NBFIs and OFIs to identify persons and/or entities transacting in or operating cryptocurrency exchanges within their systems and ensure that such accounts are closed immediately.

The Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrency and virtual currencies are largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, considering the anonymity of virtual transactions.

x

Luno said it is aware of the cryptocurrency ban in Nigeria – and it is having discussions with the authorities.

The cryptocurrency trading platform said its Nigerian customers will “receive more information, along with the planned launch date, soon” but “can still buy, sell, send, receive and earn crypto with funds that are already in your wallet.”

CBN’s ban on cryptocurrency, however, divided opinion within the government hierarchy.

Nigeria’s vice president Yemi Osinbajo opposed the ban and instead called for regulation of cryptocurrency trading.

Osinbajo said there should be “a robust regulatory regime that addresses these serious concerns without killing the goose that might lay the golden eggs – so it should be thoughtful and knowledge-based regulation, not prohibition.”

x

However, Nigerians are navigating the regulation through P2P trading and other third-party platforms. The government has since planned to offer an alternative to young Nigerians with the introduction of e-Naira.

CBN governor Godwin Emefiele listed the benefits of the e-Naira to include increased cross-border trade and accelerated financial inclusion.

The Nigerian apex bank is engaging a Barbados-based digital financial technology firm, Bitt Inc, as a technical partner for its e-Naira project due for unveiling before the end of 2021.

With operations spreading across the Caribbean, Bitt utilises blockchain and distributed ledger technology to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions with mobile money across a suite of Bitt’s Software and mobile applications.

2021-09-17,Cointelegraph,Ethereum eyes $6.5K bullish target as ETH price chart paints ‘cup and handle’,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-eyes-6-5k-bullish-target-as-eth-price-chart-paints-cup-and-handle,"Ethereum blockchain’s native asset, Ether (ETH), faces the prospect of exploding toward $6,500 in the coming sessions.

ETH looks like a cup and handle too. Thoughts? — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) September 15, 2021

The bullish analogy takes cues from a textbook technical pattern dubbed “cup and handle.” In detail, a cup and handle structure develops after the price first rallies significantly to the upside and then corrects to carve out a rounding bottom, called the “cup.”

The move follows a rebound toward the prior high and a failed breakout attempt above the said level. As a result, the price pulls back once again and grinds out a smaller rounding bottom, called the “handle.”

Ultimately, the price returns to a prior high for the second time and breaks out successfully, resulting in a move equal to the cup’s depth.

So, it seems the ETH/USD exchange rate has painted a cup and is now forming a handle, as is shown in the chart below.

The depth of the ETH/USD’s cup is nearly $2,437. As a result, should the pair retest $4,112 resistance for a bullish breakout move, its prospect of rising by as much as $2,437 will increase. In doing so, Ether would eye a run-up toward $6,549.

A Harvard study shows that cup-and-handle patterns have a 65% and 68% success rate in forex and stock markets, respectively, on daily timeframe charts.

Institutional FOMO on

Ether’s upside analogy appears against the backdrop of growing institutional interest.

In a report published on Sept. 7, Standard Chartered, a multinational banking giant headquartered in London, discussed Ether’s economic use case, adding that the cost to purchase 1 ETH could grow to $26,000–$35,000 in the future.

“The current transition to ETH 2.0 could transform ETH by increasing its functionality and scalability and reducing environmental concerns, although it could raise more complex security issues,” the report stated.

“Timelines for ETH 2.0 rollout could slip, but in the near term, decreasing net supply — as ETH is staked for ETH 2.0 — should provide price cushion.”

In an interview with CNBC, Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, said that her firm would split its crypto investments into 60% Bitcoin and 40% Ether. The former AllianceBernstein executive envisioned a higher demand for ETH tokens in the wake of ongoing growth in Ethereum-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible token (NFT) craze.

“I’m fascinated with what’s going on in DeFi, which is collapsing the cost of the infrastructure for financial services in a way that I know that the traditional financial industry does not appreciate right now,” Wood told CNBC anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin at the SALT 2021 conference in New York.

“Our confidence in Ethereum has gone up dramatically as we’ve seen the beginning of this transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.”

Rivalry risks

Meanwhile, Ethereum also faced criticism for its inability to resolve higher transaction fees and network congestion issues. That prompted emerging layer-one blockchain rivals, such as Solana, Avalanche and Cardano, to eat up a portion of Ethereum’s market hegemony.

It will take Ethereum another two years to become a fully functional proof-of-stake protocol, per its official roadmap. The transition consists of a three-step process. In the first, Ethereum has implemented the Beacon Chain to introduce staking on a separate layer.

The next step, scheduled sometime later in 2021, will see Ethereum’s original chain merger with the Beacon Chain. Meanwhile, Ethereum will introduce “shard chains” that expect to enable Ethereum to process more transactions in the final phase.

I can confirm today that when we do so, we also expect that we similarly will accept Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash,"" Aron said in a tweet here on Wednesday.

The company said in August that it would start accepting bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, by the end of the year.

Prices of bitcoin and ether were marginally down, while litecoin was up 1.7%. AMC's shares, one of the so-called ""meme stocks"", were down about 1% in premarket trading.

""While I don't think this is going to make any of these coins do any parabolic movements as a result, to me this is just another awesome step in the global adoption of crypto as a whole,"" said one user in the Reddit group r/cryptocurrency that discusses digital currencies.

Many big corporations in America are jumping on to the crypto bandwagon even as concerns grow over the environmental impact since ""mining"" digital currencies consumes massive amounts of energy.

Analysts have also raised questions about the viability of day-to-day use of cryptocurrencies.

""People are not buying Bitcoin to spend them. For me, it's still not a nicely established currency in the sense that it's more of an investment for the future or for something that we may want to have in the future,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.

2021-09-17,NDTV Gadgets 360,"What Is Doge Killer Cryptocurrency, and Is it a Real Challenger to Dogecoin?",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/what-is-doge-killer-cryptocurrency-coin-how-has-it-performed-so-far-2542788,"Dogecoin has seen its share of imitators and competitors, the most famous of which was possibly Shiba Inu, with the SHIB token. Others include two tokens called Doge Killer, with the token names KILLDOGE and LEASH. While the former never really saw high value, LEASH was at one point this year trading at almost $8,000 for one token. But how is it holding today, and could it really kill Dogecoin, which has the backing of such famous names as Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. Doge Killer (LEASH), operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Its real appeal is its scarcity because of an extremely small supply of 1,07,647 coins. This makes it highly volatile. Dogecoin Killer also has a few whale accounts, which can influence its price quickly and suddenly.

In the past 24 hours, Doge Killer has gained more than 9 per cent to reach a price of $786.31 (roughly Rs. 57,725), according to CoinMarketCap. But an analysis of the data from the past three months suggests that Doge Killer has lost a significant value. During the Bitcoin bull-run that took place in the first half of the year, Doge Killer along with most other cryptocurrencies saw its value rise up sharply, and in May it peaked at $7,902.

Its price fell sharply after that, trading at a little above $2,000 (roughly Rs. 1.46 lakh) before shooting up to twice as much near the end of the month for about a week, before starting a decline again in August. But after that, it continued to decline. Experts say whales played a role in its meteoric rise and then sudden fall.

The cryptocurrency has a fully diluted market capitalization of $84,643,791 (roughly Rs. 621 crore). After studying these data, if you are wondering whether you should buy a meme cryptocurrency then Doge Killer could be an option. However, perform due diligence and do detailed research to understand the risks of cryptocurrency investments.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/49nrvmng_dogecoin-cryptocurrency-doge_625x300_31_August_21.jpg',)",2 min read,"Doge Killer (LEASH), operates on the Ethereum blockchain.

Christopher Nolan, who directed Dunkirk, the Dark Knight series, and Tenet, had some high demands for his upcoming movie Oppenheimer. Nolan requested a 100-day theatrical window, which far exceeds the 45-day window for Marvel’s Shang-Chi . The request was not able to be met by movie studios like Apple and Warner Brothers, but Universal was able to guarantee Nolan’s demands. The news is obviously important for companies like AMC, and it will be interesting to see if other directors adopt Nolan’s stance on longer theatrical windows.

AMC CEO Adam Aron revealed the company’s plans for accepting cryptocurrencies at its locations by the end of 2021. AMC joins a long list of companies that have adopted cryptos as payment. Aron went on to confirm that the major tokens will be accepted including Bitcoin, Ethereum , Litecoin , and Bitcoin Cash . It is interesting to note that despite being a retail investor favorite, AMC is refusing to accept Dogecoin at its ticket booths and concession stands.

NYSE:AMC had a mostly flat day on Wednesday despite the broader meme stock sector advancing on no major news. Shares of AMC fell by 0.97% during the session, and closed the day at $46.84 . AMC lagged the broader markets which saw all three major indices close the session in the green. Meme stocks were mostly on the rise on Wednesday, as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) gained 2.65% and 3.12% respectively. AMC has been unable to capitalize on a busy weekend at the box office, and the stock is now trading lower this week despite a surge on Monday to start the week.

In 2017, Qin had set up a hedge fund called Virgil Sigma Fund LP based in the New York City — where investors could invest money to purchase the cryptocurrency of their choice. Qin informed the US court that he developed a special trading algorithm called “Tenjin” that could generate profits by facilitating the purchase of a cryptocurrency on one exchange and selling it at a higher price on another, taking advantage of the difference in the prices across exchanges.

In 2017, his hedge fund Virgil had yielded an annual return of 500 percent, after which the Wall Street Journal had written a profile on Qin in 2018.

As part of his scam, Bloomberg reported that Qin lured investors by projecting that the invested fund was not exposed to any risk from the fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies under the pretense of providing a safe space for investors and later used the money for his personal gains.

Qin reportedly began using the investors' capital to pay for his personal expenses and to make illiquid investments in other entities like real estate that had nothing to do with cryptocurrencies as promised to the investors.

In addition, the 24-year-old was also found to have been using a substantial portion of investor capital to invest in crypto-assets like initial coin offerings — that had nothing to do with the fund's stated arbitrage strategy.

As per the US Department of Justice, Qin regularly lied to his investors about the value, location, and status of their investment capital using false account statements and bogus tax documents that he prepared and circulated among his investors.

Calling him “potentially dangerous person”, US District Judge Valerie Caproni said Qin was “deliberately and consciously” choosing to scam his investors in this “white collar crime that is just as devastating to victims as other types of crimes”, the Bloomberg reported added.

Towards the end of 2020, Qin's investors had begun to get suspicious of his intensions and had started asking for their investment back. After that, the US Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly froze his fund's crypto assets, leading to the surrender and arrest of Qin earlier this year.

Several investors who lost their money to this scam had reached out to the court claiming that they have lost their life savings to Qin's fraud.

2021-09-16,Onmanorama,Invest in future: A quick guide to cryptocurrency,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/business/2021/09/16/invest-in-future-quick-guide-to-cryptocurrency.html,"Has cryptocurrency come of age in 2021? Crypto has soared in the first half of the current financial year. The value of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin shot up.

Major corporations including Apple, Google, Tesla, Samsung, Facebook and PayPal have devised strategies tuned to crypto. Pioneers in the technology count themselves among millionaires now.

After initial skepticism, India is slowly changing its stand towards crypto. Legislation is on the anvil to classify crypto as an asset like a commodity. There are a few things you have to be aware of before investing in crypto.

Research first

Any monetary decision should be preceded by detailed research and homework. Conduct a detailed study about all the cryptos out there in the market. First you have learn what blockchain technology is. Blockchain is the foundational tech of crypto.

Steer clear of schemes

Crypto is decentralised. There is no regulatory mechanism available as with central bank-issued currencies. You have to do your homework about the source of the currency, the nature of the issuer and their authenticity. Do not fall into traps and fraudulent schemes. Be wary of fraudsters who promise impossible returns.

Start small

The value of crypto is volatile. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Test the waters by investing a small amount. You can start small trading too. Start with a single currency and follow its trends. That will give you a deeper insight into how cryptos work. Once you are confident of the sector, you can diversify your investment.

Devise your own strategy

There are fraudsters and imposters in all fields. Crypto is no exception. There are people who collect money from gullible investors and supply them with wallets with non-existing currencies. Once they get the money, they would be untraceable. Do not take all advice at face value. Learn on your own. Learn about all the currencies in the market. Consider the opinions of experts in the field. Do not imbibe whatever you see on social media. You have to form an investment strategy that suits you best.

Maintain equilibrium

Crypto investment demands patience. This is a highly volatile market. There may be a spike in prices. There may be a slide in prices. Face these swings with equanimity. Analyse the market calmly and logically.

Be safe

Cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets. There are online wallets and offline wallets. New investors are recommended to keep an online wallet. Get a strong password to keep you safe from hacking and online theft. It is a good idea to create an exclusive email id for crypto transactions alone.

Know your taxes

Before you invest in crypto, you have to have a deep understanding about local tax laws in the country where your assets are based in. Most of the countries tax crypto heavily.","('https://img.onmanorama.com/content/dam/mm/en/news/business/images/2021/9/16/cryptocurrency-bitcoin.jpg',)",2 min read,"You have to do your homework about the source of the currency, the nature of the issuer and their authenticity.

2021-09-16,NDTV.com,Cryptocurrency In India: What Can We Expect In The Future?,https://www.ndtv.com/business/india-and-cryptocurrency-what-lies-ahead-2539082,"Currently, bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are beyond the purview of legal regulation in India

Indian investors are waiting in anticipation for the official verdict on cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Even though El Salvador has embraced the digital revolution in currency, India is still mulling over the issue. Last week, Jayant Singh, Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, said in an online event that the Indian government would take a “distinctive approach” to regulate cryptocurrencies in India. The statement came at a time when cryptocurrency is still unregulated in the country. India has a strong base of cryptocurrency investors and exchanges. But investors are still in the dark about the future of cryptocurrency.

Is Cryptocurrency Illegal In India?

Currently, bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are beyond the purview of legal regulation in India. We cannot call them illegal because they are not yet authorised for use by any central authority in the country. Cryptocurrency remains outside the scope of any guidelines, regulations, or rules. This makes Bitcoin and altcoin transactions riskier because disputes arising from these exchanges will not be legally bound.

Cryptocurrency Taxes

Though India hasn't yet imposed regulations on cryptocurrency transactions, it has asked for transparency in all such undertakings. In April, amendments were introduced in the Companies Act for this purpose. Owing to this transparency, digital asset and the gains thereof are likely to be counted as a capital asset, which is bound by taxes under capital gains. But companies are not yet sure how to treat the different types of gains and income in this regard.

Cryptocurrency Bill

The Cryptocurrency Bill is speculated to be tabled during the Parliament's winter session this year. Its aim is to define and classify cryptocurrency according to the technology involved. An inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency recently suggested that cryptocurrencies be treated as digital assets and not currency. There are also speculations that government-enforced crypto coins may become the norm.

What If India Bans Cryptocurrency?

A ban on cryptocurrency in India would mean you won't be able to convert local fiat currency to buy cryptocurrency or liquidate HODL-ed cryptocurrencies into cash. Crypto exchanges will also stop. The ban would ensure that the HODL-ed cryptocurrency stays on HODL until the restriction is lifted.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/2r1h0gng_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",2 min read,"Even though El Salvador has embraced the digital revolution in currency, India is still mulling over the issue.

Walmart Inc said on Monday it was looking into how a fake press statement announcing a partnership with litecoin, which briefly led to near 30% gains in the cryptocurrency, was issued by news release distributor GlobeNewswire.

The fake press release touting the acceptance of litecoin as online payment by the world's largest retailer led to a sudden spike in its prices, but the gains faded quickly after Walmart issued a statement saying the press release was fraudulent.

Bitcoin’s spectacular fall from grace has also dragged its rivals into the red zone in another blow to cryptocurrency.

Last week, an estimated $US400 billion ($A543 billion) vanished from the crypto market after bitcoin crashed by more than 10 per cent in a single day.

The volatile cryptocurrency dropped from $US50,257 ($A68,211) to $US43,351 ($A58,838).

It’s stayed below the critical $US50,000 ($A68,000) mark ever since.

At time of writing, bitcoin had gained a bit, trading at $US45,055.31 ($A61,151.32).

The massive price drop came as El Salvador became the first country to introduce bitcoin as legal tender.

Although the country’s radical move at first buoyed the market, it soon sent bitcoin plummeting after the country had to pause digital wallets because of a glitch.

Like dominoes, other cryptocurrency started to topple.

Ethereum, cardano and binance recorded even sharper falls than their bitcoin counterparts.

The three digital coins plunged between 13 per cent and 18 per cent last week.

At time of writing, etheruem was trading at $US3288.95 ($A4463.93), down from its all-time high of $US4196.63 ($A5695.88) in May, according to cryptocurrency aggregator CoinMarketCap.

A single Cardano coin can now be bought for $US2.42 ($A3.28) down from its highest ever price of $US2.58 ($A3.50) late last month.

As for binance, the coin is now worth $US399.46 ($A542.17) despite its all-time high in May of $690.90 ($A937.72).

In all, $400 billion ($A543 billion) was wiped off the charts, and the world’s cryptocurrencies hit this year’s rock bottom of a market cap $1.9 trillion ($A2.58 trillion) on Tuesday, according to Forbes.

However, despite the shaky start to El Salvador’s bid as a crypto nation, the country’s leader decided to make the most of the coin crashes.

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced the country took advantage of the “dip” by buying up an additional 150 bitcoins.

Mr Bukele’s holdings have now gone up to 550 coins – worth a total of about $US25 million ($A34 million).

First country to make bitcoin legal tender

In June, El Salvador voted to become the first nation in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.

With 62 out of 84 possible votes, politicians voted in favour of the move to create a law to adopt bitcoin for everyday use.

The bill allows the famously volatile digital currency to be used for many aspects of daily life, from property purchases to tax contributions.

The law came into effect last Tuesday, on September 7.

To encourage citizens to jump on the bandwagon, the El Salvador government even handed out $30 in free bitcoins to anyone who signed up for its national digital wallet, known as Chivo.

Foreigners who invest three bitcoins into the country – currently a whopping $US150,000 ($A200,000) – will be granted residency, according to Fast Company.

Bitcoin investors can also avoid paying tax, according to The Coin Telegraph.

However, not everyone is a fan of the move.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is worried about the coin’s volatility and has warned that it could destabilise the El Salvador economy.

Along with this, crypto investors are also watching the formation of a golden cross in Bitcoin. If this bullish setup completes, it will signal a trend in favor of the bulls. For the time being, investors continue to focus on select altcoins that have continued their northward journey.

On the fundamental front, Bitcoin reached another milestone as miners produced the 700,000th block on Sept. 11. Bitcoin was trading near $8,000 when the 600,000th block was reached on Oct. 18, 2019.

Reaching this milestone led some Twitter users to quote Hal Finney, one of Bitcoin’s earliest pioneers who said:

""Every day that goes by and Bitcoin hasn't collapsed due to legal or technical problems, that brings new information to the market. It increases the chance of Bitcoin's eventual success and justifies a higher price.""

Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may attract trader’s attention in the short term.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin closed below the 200-day SMA ($45,894) on Sept. 10 but bears have not been able to capitalize on this move. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back above the 200-day SMA.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The moving averages are close to completing a golden cross, indicating that the advantage is likely to tilt in favor of the bulls. If buyers push the price above $47,399.97, the BTC/USDT pair will attempt to rise to the overhead zone of $50,500 to $52,920.

The bears are likely to defend the overhead zone aggressively but if bulls do not give up much ground, the likelihood of a break above $52,920 increases. If that happens, the pair could rally to $60,000.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that bears are aggressively defending the 200-day SMA. The pair could then retest the critical support at $42,451.67. A break below this level could tilt the advantage in favor of bears.

BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the price turned down from $47,550 on two occasions. Hence, this becomes an important level to watch out for in the short term. A break and close above this resistance may open the doors for a possible move to $50,500.

However, the moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, indicating that sellers are attempting to make a comeback. A break and close below $44,000 could signal a minor advantage to bears. The pair could then drop to the critical level at $42,451.67.

ALGO/USDT

The long tail on Sept. 7 shows that bulls aggressively bought the dip to the 50-day SMA ($1.10). Strong buying on Sept. 8 propelled Algorand (ALGO) above the stiff overhead resistance at $1.84.

ALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears tried to trap the bulls by sinking the price below the breakout level at $1.84 on Sept. 10 but the buyers had other plans. The ALGO/USDT pair has rebounded off the support with strength on Sept. 12 and bulls are currently attempting to thrust the price above $2.49.

If they succeed, the pair could resume the uptrend with the first target on the upside at $3 and then $3.32. On the contrary, if the price once again turns down from $2.49, the pair could drop to $1.84 and stay range-bound between these two levels for the next few days.

A break and close below $1.84 will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap. The pair could then slide to $1.60.

ALGO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that bears are defending the overhead resistance at $2.49. If sellers pull the price below $2.30, the pair could again slide to the breakout level at $1.84. A bounce off this support could suggest a range-bound action for some time.

If bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will increase the possibility of a break above $2.49. If buyers sustain the breakout, it could signal the resumption of the uptrend.

ATOM/USDT

Cosmos (ATOM) bounced off the breakout level at $17.56 on Sept. 7, suggesting that bulls are aggressively defending this support. This was the second instance that bulls successfully held this level; the first was on Aug. 26–27.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The long tail on Sept. 8 showed that sentiment was turning positive and traders were buying on dips. The moving averages have completed a golden cross, indicating that bulls are back in the driver’s seat.

Strong buying today has pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $32.32. If bulls sustain the breakout, the ATOM/USDT pair may rally to $39.43.

The bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below $32.32 and trap the aggressive bulls. If they succeed, the pair may drop to $26. A break below this level will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened.

ATOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that bears sold the breakout above $32.32 but they could not sustain the pair below $32. This suggests that bulls continue to buy on every minor dip. If bulls sustain the price above $32.32, the pair could rally to $38.49.

Conversely, if bears again pull the price below $32.32, the pair could drop to $30.98. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will attempt to resume the uptrend but if the support cracks, the decline could extend to the critical support at $26.

XTZ/USDT

Tezos (XTZ) completed a successful retest of the breakout level at $4.47 on Sept. 7 and Sept. 8. Although bears pulled the price below the 200-day SMA ($4.19), they could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests accumulation on dips.

XTZ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The XTZ/USDT pair picked up momentum on Sept. 9 and bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $6.14 on Sept. 10. The long wick on the candlestick of the past two days indicates strong selling near $7.

Hence, this becomes an important resistance for the bulls to cross. If they manage to do that, the pair could retest the all-time high at $8.42. A breakout and close above this level will suggest the start of a new uptrend.

Alternatively, if the price once again turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair could drop to $5. Such a move will suggest aggressive profit-booking at higher levels.

XTZ/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows the pair is currently consolidating between $5.88 and $6.80. If bulls drive and sustain the price above the overhead resistance zone at $6.80 to $6.95, the pair may rally to $7.72.

If the price turns down from $6.80, the pair may extend its range-bound action for some more time. A break and close below $5.88 will be the first sign that bulls are losing their grip. The pair could then drop to the 50-SMA.

EGLD/USD

Elrond (EGLD) rebounded off the 200-day SMA ($131) on Sept. 7 and Sept. 8, suggesting strong demand at lower levels. The moving averages completed a golden cross on Sept. 9, indicating that bulls are back in command.

EGLD/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Sustained buying propelled the EGLD/USDT pair to a new all-time high on Sept. 11 where bears tried to stall the up-move. However, the bulls were in no mood to let go of their advantage and have pushed the price to a new all-time high today.

If bulls sustain the price above $245.80, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend. The bears may pose a stiff challenge at the psychological level at $300, but if bulls can overcome this resistance, the rally may extend to $357.80.

The bears will have to pull and sustain the price below the breakout level at $245.80 to signal a possible change in trend.

EGLD/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the ascending channel pattern. If they manage to do that, the bullish momentum could pick up further and the pair may enter a blow-off phase.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level, the pair may drop to the support line of the channel. A strong rebound off it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips.

A break and close below the channel will be the first sign that the bullish momentum could be weakening.

2021-09-12,NDTV Gadgets 360,"Stablecoin cryptocurrency said to be discussed within US treasury, financial industry",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-stablecoin-us-treasury-financial-industry-risk-analysis-2537259,"The US Treasury Department met with a number of industry participants this week to quiz them about the risks and benefits posed by stablecoins -- a rapidly growing type of cryptocurrencies, the value of which is pegged to traditional currencies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings.

Washington policymakers are alarmed at the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market which exceeded a record $2 trillion in April. As of Friday, the market cap of stablecoins stood at roughly $125 billion, according to industry data site CoinMarketCap. It is unclear which financial regulations apply to these relatively new products.

U.S. financial regulators are working to understand the risks and opportunities posed by cryptocurrencies to the traditional US financial system and plan to issue a number of reports on the subject in coming months, they have said.

In July, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

In a sign those efforts are gathering pace, Treasury officials this week met with financial industry executives to discuss potential stablecoin regulation, the three sources said.

Two of the people said that in meetings this week, one of which took place on Friday, officials asked whether stablecoins would require direct oversight if they become extremely popular. They also discussed how regulators should try to mitigate the risks of too many people trying to cash in their stablecoins at the same time, and whether major stablecoins should be backed by traditional assets.

Officials also asked about how stablecoins should be structured, how they could be used, whether the current regulatory framework is sufficient, and other safety and soundness issues, one of the people said.

Treasury officials also met earlier in the week with a group of banks and credit unions to discuss similar issues, another of the people said. Treasury officials appeared to be gathering information and did not share their thinking on how stablecoins should be regulated, this person added.

The information gathered at this week's meetings is likely to help shape a broad Treasury report on stablecoins expected in the coming months.

In a statement, Treasury spokesman John Rizzo said the department is examining ""potential benefits and risks of stablecoins for users, markets, or the financial system.""

""As this work continues, the Treasury Department is meeting with a broad range of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, members of Congress and market participants,” he added.

Washington policymakers worry the rise in privately-operated currencies could undermine their control of the financial and monetary systems, increase systemic risks, promote financial crime, and hurt investors.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also working on cryptocurrency projects, they have said.

As of September 11 (10:19am IST), Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.16 lakhs.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/lpm28078_crypto-bloomberg_625x300_16_August_21.jpg',)",2 min read,"As of Friday, the market cap of stablecoins stood at roughly $125 billion, according to industry data site CoinMarketCap.

2021-09-11,,Top 10 Cryptocurrencies for Long-term Investment,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-cryptocurrencies-for-long-term-investment/,"Top 10 Cryptocurrencies for Long-term Investment

In the domain of cryptocurrencies, the term “crypto” denotes the complicated cryptography that permits the creation and processing of digital currencies, and also their transactions through decentralized networks. Although this essential aspect of the sector has come under assault as it has grown in popularity, cryptocurrencies are nearly always meant to be impervious to government exploitation and regulation. In this post, you will learn about the top 10 cryptocurrencies which are worth it for long-term investments.

Best Cryptocurrencies for Long-term Investment

Bitcoin- BTC

Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency that was established in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an unknown individual or group of individuals. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital money that may be transmitted directly from one user to another on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. Cryptography is used by network nodes to validate transactions, which are subsequently recorded in a blockchain, a public distributed ledger.

Regardless of whether its price increases or decreases, bitcoin will remain dominant in the cryptocurrency market. Strong liquidity will benefit traders as long as it persists, regardless of market volatility.

Ethereum- ETH

Ethereum is a decentralised digital platform that enables the creation and execution of Smart Contracts and DApps without any need for third-party downtime, fraud, control, or interference. Ethereum is a permissionless, non-hierarchical collection of servers (nodes) that produce and reach consensus on an ever-growing network of “blocks,” or bunches of transactions, known as the blockchain.

Tether- USDT

Tether, formerly known as Realcoin, was among the first cryptocurrencies to be linked to the US dollar when it was established in 2014. Tether is a cryptocurrency whose crypto tokens are insured by an equal number of traditional fiat currencies kept in a separate bank account, such as the dollar, pound, or Japanese yen. Tether is a stablecoin, a form of cryptocurrency that aims to keep cryptocurrency prices consistent, as opposed to the large price swings seen in other prominent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Bitcoin's recent surge has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm. It breached the $50,000 mark again a few days ago and has continued to stay over the psychological level since. Bitcoin, the world's largest and oldest cryptocurrency, has left analysts wondering whether or not it will be able to keep its price intact. There are also speculations over a surge in the prices of altcoins. Altcoins, or Bitcoin alternative cryptocurrencies, are showing a stellar performance on the charts, with some long-time competitors like Ethereum still competing for a growing market cap.

Given that altcoins and NFTs saw hype among investors over July and August, the cryptocurrency scene could witness unexpected surges on these fronts.

Here are some altcoins, whose prices may rise in days to come:

Ethereum (ETH): At the time of writing, Ethereum's price hovered around $3,732.40. Over the last week, Ethereum or ether rose in value by 12.34 per cent. It has seen steady growth over the months, making the speculations stronger.

Cardano (ADA): Cardano is the other big name that may see a surge in price in the future. It ranks third, with a market cap of $84 billion. The coin witnessed a stark rise this May when Tesla stopped taking payments in Bitcoin due to the large electricity expenditure over its mining. ADA reached new heights as investors found an environmentally sustainable alternative in it. An update this month will bring smart contracts to its blockchain and more investors may get interested in it. A price rise won't be surprising.

Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink ranks 12 on the charts. But its popularity among investors and on social media is grabbing eyeballs. Over the last 7 days, it has seen a rise by almost 23 per cent in value. Its value rests at around $32 per token currently. Sites like Coin Quora and others suggest a bullish target for LINK and expect it to cross the $50 mark within a year.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The meme currency was made popular by the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. It rose to prominence in the past few months. Now, it's one of the cryptocurrencies that is considered to be a viable investment option. In 2021, the cryptocurrency returned more than 8,000 per cent.

Avalanche (AVAX): Alongside Cardano and Dogecoin, this altcoin has received a lot of attention in 2021. It has a maximum supply of 720 million. In August 2021, its value tripled. In fact, since its inception in September 2020, the coin has returned a whopping 2,440 per cent.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-04/q7d8b2k8_bitcoin_625x300_06_April_21.jpg',)",2 min read,"The altcoin craze among investors may result in a surge in the values of these digital assetsBitcoin's recent surge has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm.

2021-09-11,News18,'How Bitcoin will help Indian Economy': RBI Guv has Major Concerns About Cryptocurrency,https://www.news18.com/news/business/how-bitcoin-will-help-indian-economy-rbi-guv-has-major-concerns-about-cryptocurrency-4186169.html,"Shaktikanta Das, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expressed on Thursday, at an event organized by The Indian Express and Financial Times, that the central bank continues to have ‘serious and major’ concerns regarding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, reported PTI. This concern was conveyed to the government of India. However, Das said that the final call on the issue falls to the government and that they have to decide what to do on the matter, according to the report. Das added that the RBI would like to have credible explanations and answers as to the value that such instruments (cryptocurrencies) can get the Indian economy.

It should be noted that cryptocurrencies are under the regulatory gaze and have been for some time now, with the government still on the fence as to whether to allow them fully or not. This is despite their obvious lack of regulation, highly complex mining processes and price volatility that make it such an unstable financial instrument. At the moment calls have been made to treat cryptocurrencies as a foreign asset according to the report.

One of the first countries to recognise Bitcoin as an official asset was El Salvador. The South American nation recognised the digital asset earlier this week on September 7, 2021. The country decided to adopt crypto as a legal tender. In the wake of this, the country has also been witnessing waves of civil unrest following the value correction of the currency by 20 per cent in a single day, reports mentioned.

Speaking at the event, Das said, “We have conveyed our serious and major concerns about cryptocurrencies to the government from a point of view of financial stability. The government will take a decision.”

“I think we need more credible answers as to whether going forward, the whole private cryptocurrencies, what contribution it will make to the Indian economy going forward. I think we need to be convinced with more credible explanations and answers,” he added.

The apex bank had initially banned the domestic lenders from facilitating investors’ trade in cryptocurrencies, but this was reversed after the Supreme Court struck down the order. It was alleged that some banks have resumed these services. Earlier this year in March, Das said that he had reason to believe that the government shares the concerns that were flagged by the RBI, according to the report.

On a parallel note, India has been taking steps towards its own form of a legally recognised digital rupee. Also called the Central Bank Digital Currency, the RBI is gearing up for a phased introduction of the asset. Das had mentioned last month that the digital currency would be rolled out with trial programmes by December. Unlike cryptocurrency, the Central Bank Digital Currency will be regulated. Most interestingly, it will not be an asset so to speak, but a digital reflection of the current monetary system. It will be exchangeable one-to-one with the Indian Rupee.

Cryptocurrencies on the other hand can be considered as commodities that have a set value to them, like gold or silver. That value will be uniform across the board, irrespective of the country it is being traded within, with the only factor to be considered being the currency conversion rate that would represent that value. Das had mentioned that the RBI was aiming to launch the central bank digital currency as a mass-scale digital asset. The RBI had put out a note stating that the central bank digital currency and the interest it held as an asset were universal. However, few countries have even come close to the pilot stage of launching such an endeavour.

The world's largest cryptocurrency is up over 60% this year (year-to-date), though, much lower from nearly $65,000 record high it hit in April.

Bitcoin prices surged 2% to $47,067.77 as volatility eased after crashing on El Salvador's adopted the crypto asset as legal tender and the threat of a US lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc underscored the rocky road ahead for cryptocurrencies.

Ether, the coin linked to ethereum and second largest crypto by market capitalization, was up 1.5% to $3,519.5. Meanwhile, dogecoin prices gained to $0.25 whereas Cardano at $2.59, up nearly 2%. Other digital tokens like XRP rose 11% and Uniswap, Stellar, Litecoin gained over 1% over the last 24 hours.

Coinbase on Wednesday had said that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had threatened to sue the cryptocurrency exchange if it launches a program that lets users earn interest by lending crypto assets. The SEC issued Coinbase with a Wells notice, indicating the U.S. regulator will sue if the crypto exchange goes ahead with the launch of its interest-bearing ""Lend"" product for crypto assets, reported Reuters.

Earlier this week, Bitcoin prices plummeted from more than $52,000 per coin to $42,000, before recovering about half of that loss after El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender and the rollout stumbled in its first hours as El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said the digital wallet used for transactions was not functioning.

The chairman of India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance explains that cryptocurrency legislation in India will be “distinct and unique.” He added, “We have to balance stability and growth but we recognize how important this whole area of crypto is.”

Lawmaker Provides an Update on Crypto Legislation

Jayant Sinha, a lawmaker of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, talked about India’s cryptocurrency legislation Wednesday at an event organized by the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) of Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).

Sinha, who is the chairman of India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, explained that it is not possible for India to adopt the cryptocurrency policies used in advanced economies because the nation still does not have a full capital account convertibility. He clarified that India’s crypto policies will not follow the U.S., Japan, or El Salvador, the country which made bitcoin legal tender this week.

The lawmaker elaborated:

Our solution will have to be distinct and unique simply because of our unique circumstances. We have to balance stability and growth but we recognize how important this whole area of crypto is.

Furthermore, he noted that the committee will consider crypto legislation with national security in mind, adding: “We have to be very watchful about what happens to these crypto assets and cryptocurrencies. Use of these kinds of crypto instruments in terror financing and for domestic security threats is something we have to be mindful of.”

On Tuesday, a former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), R. Gandhi, said that crypto must be regulated as an asset or commodity in India and governed by existing laws. He explained that “Once cryptocurrencies are accepted, rules governing commodity exchanges could apply and the coins could be used to pay for goods and services,” Bloomberg conveyed, and quoted him as saying, “Then automatically people can start buying, selling and holding.”

According to a recent report, the Indian government is planning to regulate crypto assets as commodities and by use cases. Previously, there were reports of the government planning to ban all cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, allowing only central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to be issued by the RBI. Meanwhile, the central bank is planning to unveil a digital rupee model by the end of the year.

2021-09-11,NDTV Gadgets 360,"India to Take Distinctive Approach Toward Cryptocurrencies, Not Like the US or El Salvador",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-india-approach-distinctive-not-like-us-el-salvador-jayant-sinha-2535358,"The government will take a distinctive approach to regulate cryptocurrencies in India that will be different from the western markets, Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance Jayant Sinha said during an online event. The latest comments from the lawmaker come amid uncertainty among Indian stakeholders due to long anticipation of regulation for Bitcoin and other crypto instruments. The country has a strong base of cryptocurrency exchanges and investors, but it so far has not recognised cryptocurrencies as a legal asset or currency.

Speaking at crypto asset conference HODL – 2021, organised by the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) of Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), Sinha said that India would not follow the US, Japan, or El Salvador in its approach toward cryptocurrencies.

“Our solution will have to be distinct and unique for India, simply because of our unique circumstances,” the MP and former Minister of State for Finance said.

He also said that the process of regulating cryptocurrencies would involve “stakeholder consultations”, after getting approvals from the parliament.

“It would be good if we have global standards and then if there is something above and beyond the global standards, that is unique to India, that can also be developed and worked,” Sinha said.

The lawmaker also noted that the country needs to consider legislation on cryptocurrencies that keeps national security concerns in mind.

In late January, the government proposed a bill to prohibit “all private cryptocurrencies” in the country and develop a framework for creating an official digital currency issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Just a couple of days after that bill got listed on the Lok Sabha bulletin, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur said while responding to a question raised in Rajya Sabha by saying that the government “does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coins”. He also underlined that the government would take all measures to eliminate use of crypto assets in financing illegal activities or as part of the payment system.

Those two major activities, along with an earlier RBI's ban on cryptocurrencies that was quashed by the Supreme Court last year, raised concerns among investors in the country.

However, major cryptocurrency stakeholders are optimistic and consider the fresh comments from Sinha as an indication of a positive move by the government.

“We agree with what Mr. Sinha mentioned,” said Avinash Shekhar, Co-CEO of Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange ZebPay. “India has its own unique strengths and issues when it comes to implementing laws and regulations around crypto and we're looking forward to a regulatory framework that matches these unique needs.”

Shekhar moderated the session with Sinha during the online conference. He expressed the need for an open discussion to address the government's concerns.

Nischal Shetty, CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, said the demand for cryptocurrencies had been steadily rising in the country and the move by the government could be a significant boost to the crypto ecosystem as a whole.

“We are optimistic and look forward to working closely with the government in regulating crypto in a manner that fosters innovation. We further hope that the government consults with the industry players and takes into consideration their recommendations before finalising on the bill,” he said.

Sharan Nair, Chief Business Officer of Bengaluru-based cryptocurrency trading platform CoinSwitch Kuber, also agreed to the comments made by Sinha.

“The laws around crypto can't simply be replicated from how other countries treat crypto,” he said. “In this process, crypto exchanges like CoinSwitch Kuber are more than willing to work alongside the regulators and policymakers to define laws that keep the nation's interest in mind.”

Similar to Indian cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms, global players in the cryptocurrency market are also seeing the country with a massive potential to help grow digital currencies around the world.

“Once we have the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in place, the industry will be well-poised for growth,” said Vincent Lau, Managing Director of International Operations, Seychelles-based Huobi Global. “We will continue to evolve our operations to meet the requirements of India's regulatory environment as part of our global expansion strategy.”

Market analysts believe that while it is difficult to come to a judgement simply from the comments made by the legislator, the government appears to be emphasising on a delayed approach to play safe in the field of cryptocurrencies.

“India's hesitation to welcome cryptos is understandable and it will be some time before it becomes widely accepted,” said Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst at brokerage firm ThinkMarkets that is based in London and Melbourne.

He added that Sinha merely underlined some of the known challenges that India would face with adopting cryptocurrencies, including issues over governance, taxation and national security.

Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst at New York-based multi-asset trading firm OANDA, said that India had too much resistance that it would not be one of the first adopters of Bitcoin.

“India is taking a cautious approach to cryptocurrencies and will be unable to create their own since they don't have full capital account convertibility. India has gone from banning cryptos to slowly trying to figure out how they can make it work for them,” he noted.

Rajya Sabha Member Amar Patnaik, who is also a part of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance led by Sinha, stressed on the need for a strong regulatory framework for crypto assets in the country.

“The priority should be to put in a regulatory and innovation sandbox both in SEBI (Security Exchange Board of India) and RBI and see prototype wise how it can marry with the Indian system,” Patnaik said during his session at the conference.

According to various reports, India is said to have about 15 million investors in cryptocurrencies and that number is growing steadily.

Globally, a report by Fortune Business Insights suggests that the cryptocurrency market will grow at 11.2 percent to $1,758 million (roughly Rs. 12,900 crores) by 2027.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_ether_stock_unsplash_1629707389109.jpg',)",4 min read,"The government will take a distinctive approach to regulate cryptocurrencies in India that will be different from the western markets, Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance Jayant Sinha said during an online event.

Following the crypto landmark, Cardano founder and Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, said many more nations will follow the Central American country in adopting the largest cryptocurrency. He also congratulated the entire cryptocurrency community, saying El Salvador's acceptance cements the belief that people should be in control of their money. Speaking at length about the nascent industry and his own association with it in a YouTube video, Hoskinson said he joined the Bitcoin space a “very long time ago” in 2011 and the industry has grown a lot since.

Earlier this week, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin a legal tender alongside the US dollar. However, the rollout faced serious glitches and the government had to suspend its cryptocurrency app Chivo briefly to add more servers and increase capacity amid a steady stream of people joining the platform. The new system is gradually stabilising. As of September 9 (1:38pm IST), Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.75 lakhs.

Hoskinson on September 8 uploaded a YouTube video where he talked about the promise El Salvador's move holds for Bitcoin. “In the coming years, many more nation-states will use crypto as part of their monetary policy, either as reserves in their central banks or using cryptocurrency rails for central bank settlements, or potentially just simply taking a cryptocurrency as El Salvador has done and make it the national currency.”

He also expressed confidence that the younger generation will trigger the mass adoption of cryptocurrency. “The majority of people under the age of 25 have a positive view on cryptocurrencies, and a lot of them own them. That's the future,” he said.

Hoskinson was the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation's education committee and established the Cryptocurrency Research Group in 2013. He is currently leading the research, design, and development of Cardano, a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2017.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/cryptocurrency_bitcoin_starbucks_el_salvador_reuters_1631176391985.jpg',)",2 min read,"Bitcoin recently made its historic debut as a legal tender in El Salvador.

2021-09-11,CNBC,Ukraine is the latest country to legalize bitcoin as the cryptocurrency slowly goes global,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/08/ukraine-legalizes-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencies.html,"Ukraine is the fifth country in as many weeks to lay down some ground rules for the cryptocurrency market, a sign that governments around the world are realizing that bitcoin is here to stay.

In a nearly unanimous vote, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted a law that legalizes and regulates cryptocurrency. The bill was set in motion in 2020 – and heads to the desk of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Until today, crypto in Ukraine has existed in a legal gray area.

Locals were allowed to buy and exchange virtual currencies, but companies and exchanges dealing in crypto were often under close watch by law enforcement.

According to the Kyiv Post, authorities have trended toward taking a combative stance when it comes to virtual cash, regarding it as a ""scam,"" raiding crypto-related businesses, and ""often confiscating expensive equipment without any grounds.""

In August, for example, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) blocked a network of what it called ""clandestine cryptocurrency exchanges"" running in the capital city Kyiv. The SBU claimed these exchanges were facilitating money laundering and providing anonymity of transactions.

The new legislation also spells out certain protections against fraud for those who own bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and in a first for Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada unicameral parliament, lawmakers have taken a stab at defining core terminology in the world of crypto.

Cryptocurrency prices continue to be in the red on September 8. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $2.o5 trillion, a 10.25 percent decrease over the last day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $244.82 billion, which makes a 51.81 percent increase.

The volume of all stable coins is now $195.51 billion – 79.86 percent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. Bitcoin's price is currently $46,309.44 and its dominance is currently 42.32 percent, an increase of 0.30 percent over the day.

This comes after El Salvador bought its first 200 bitcoins, President Nayib Bukele said on Monday, an announcement that sent the price of the cryptocurrency rising one day before the country formally adopts it as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.

Ahead of the launch, El Salvador bought 400 bitcoins worth around $20 million, Bukele said, helping drive the price of the currency above $52,000 for the first time since May. Hours later, however, bitcoin had weakened and last traded down 10.19% at $47,222.02.

(Photo: Reuters)

A massive spike in volatility in the cryptocurrency market sunk the values of popular virtual coins including Bitcoin and Ether. The virtual coin market was painted in red on Wednesday after cryptocurrency prices plunged a day ago due to delays in trading.

The delay was observed after El Salvador ran into snags after becoming the first country to officially adopt Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, as legal tender.

Shares of blockchain-related firms also fell after trading was impacted by outages. However, the major reason behind the fall in cryptocurrency valuations was the El Salvador government’s move to temporarily unplug a digital wallet to cope with demand.

Bitcoin was trading at $45,474.51, down over 13.48 per cent compared to its value 24 hours at 12:00 pm. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation fell sharply to $855 billion and the trading volume over the past 24 hours rose to 3.19 billion. The jump in trading volume was primarily due to a heavy sell-off.

Ether mirrored Bitcoin and slipped after gaining momentum over the past few weeks. It was trading at $3,352.38, down 14.45 per cent. Ether’s market capitalisation fell below $400 as a result. Like Bitcoin, Ether’s trading volume rose due to higher sell-off.

All other altcoins encountered huge losses due to the trading delays. This was the first substantial fall in the value of altcoins after an impressive rally.

Commenting on the crash, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “It was a massively volatile 24 hours for the cryptocurrency investors. Bitcoin fell from $52,900 to just over $43,000 in a very short span. This event caused a massive liquidation as more than 329,000 investors and traders got liquidated.”

“The largest altcoin, Ether, quickly replicated Bitcoin's move. However, there was some recovery later in the session. Some Bitcoin whales seem to have bought the dip as the price recovered a bit immediately following the drop,” he added.

“President of El Salvador tweeted that they added 150 Bitcoins during the dip.”

WASHINGTON — Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler on Tuesday assured lawmakers that Wall Street's top regulator is working overtime to create a set of rules to oversee the volatile cryptocurrency markets while balancing the interests of American innovators.

Gensler told the Senate Banking Committee that he and his team are trying to protect investors through better regulation of the thousands of new digital assets and coins, as well as oversight of the more-familiar bitcoin and ether markets.

The SEC chief noted the enormity of the task, telling Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., that the regulator could use ""a lot more people"" to evaluate the 6,000 novel digital ""projects"" and determine whether they all qualify as securities under U.S. law.

""Currently, we just don't have enough investor protection in crypto finance, issuance, trading, or lending,"" Gensler said in prepared remarks. ""Frankly, at this time, it's more like the Wild West or the old world of 'buyer beware' that existed before the securities laws were enacted.""

Still, some lawmakers pressured Gensler to pick up the pace, arguing the opaque definitions and an uncertain marketplace not only lead to unchecked speculation but could also stifle innovation.

Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican and the committee's ranking member, pressed Gensler early in the hearing over whether stablecoins meet the definition of a security since investors don't necessarily expect those assets to return a profit.

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency linked one-for-one to dollars or other traditional currencies and, as such, tend to be less volatile than their peers in the asset class.

""My whole point is, I think we need clarity on this,"" Toomey said. ""I think you should publicly disclose this. ... And we certainly shouldn't be taking enforcement action against somebody without having first provided that clarity.""

But where Toomey and his Republican colleagues voiced concern about the SEC's potential to stifle innovation without a public set of guidelines, Democrats tended to highlight speculative risk they see as rampant in the cryptocurrency market.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106868266-16184191082021-04-14t164959z_1636332539_rc2svm9ql4n8_rtrmadp_0_usa-senate-sec-gensler.jpeg?v=1630077287',)",2 min read,"Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler testifies at a U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing on systemic risk and market oversight on Capitol Hill in Washington May 22, 2012.

2021-09-15,Brookings Institution,Cryptocurrency flows in Africa,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/09/14/cryptocurrency-flows-in-africa/,"The use of cryptocurrencies in Africa is on the rise, as digital currencies offer a swift, convenient, and direct peer-to-peer channel for remittance payments, international commerce, and savings. To better understand the global landscape around cryptocurrency use, Chainalysis, a leading cryptocurrency market research firm, recently released a report examining key geographic trends around the financial tool, including in the nascent African crypto market.

Leo Holtz Research Assistant - Africa Growth Initiative

Although Africa captures only 2 percent of the global value of all cryptocurrencies received and sent (Figure 1), making it the world’s smallest cryptocurrency economy, the rising prominence of this innovative form of money is altering traditional financial flows to and from the continent.

Figure 1. Summary of Africa’s cryptocurrency usage (July 2019-June 2020)

Source: “The 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report,” Chainalysis, 2020.

Chainalysis finds that the largest crypto channel connects Africa to East Asia, although channels to Northern and Western Europe and then North America trail closely behind (Figure 2). According to the report, the particularly high volume of funds sent from Africa to East Asia stems from the magnitude of Chinese nationals working in Africa.

Figure 2. Africa’s cryptocurrency inflows and outflows by region (July 2019-June 2020)

Source: “The 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report,” Chainalysis, 2020.

Importantly, access to these digital currencies is providing an alternative to both traditional intra-regional transfer payments and international remittance systems, as transferring funds via cryptocurrencies circumvents paying transfer fees that remain higher in Africa than in the rest of the world. While transferring money through cryptocurrencies does incur a fee, the authors suggest its lower fee structure and the easy, universal access to cryptocurrency networks via mobile phones make these digital assets more convenient than rigid traditional-banking and money-wiring services.

Given the data challenges stemming from the decentralized exchanges that mediate crypto transactions, the authors warn that, beyond identifying the market share of retail-sized transfers (transactions under $10,000) it is very difficult to estimate the share of African cryptocurrency transfers dedicated to remittance networks (Figure 3). Notably, compared to other regions, Africa engages in the highest rate of retail-sized crypto transfers in the world, which the report attributes to the digital currency’s rising popularity for remittance payments.

Figure 3. Market share of retail-sized (less than $10,000) transfers (July 2019-June 2020)

Source: “The 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report,” Chainalysis, 2020.

Chainalysis speculates the simplification and cost-competitiveness of sending and receiving money with cryptocurrency will fuel continued growth of digital currency utilization in the region. Alongside the use of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange, stablecoins, a cryptocurrency variant whose value remains stable by pegging its price 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, offers Africans facing unstable currencies an alternative outlet in which to save money without the anxiety of devaluation. Based on the multitude of advantages over traditional financial systems, the authors suggest that the relatively small cryptocurrency market in Africa is generating significant value for the early adopters who utilize the novel tool.","('https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1121395757_small.jpg',)",2 min read,"To better understand the global landscape around cryptocurrency use, Chainalysis, a leading cryptocurrency market research firm, recently released a report examining key geographic trends around the financial tool, including in the nascent African crypto market.

(Image Solana.com)

Etherum competitor Solana — a decentralized blockchain platform that earlier this month became the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in the world ahead of Dogecoin – has remained favourite digital asset among investors globally. The cryptocurrency attracted $49.4 million – 86.4 per cent of total inflows worth $57.2 million last week into different digital assets including bitcoin, ethereum, binance, ripple, cardano, and others, according to the weekly report on digital asset fund flows by digital asset management firm CoinShares. Last week was the 4th consecutive week of inflows into digital assets that meant investors have been hoarding cryptos in their portfolios for the past four weeks.

During last week’s price falls, Solana’s price was a stalwart, outperforming a basket of the top 10 digital assets by 34 per cent and having risen 24 per cent week-on-week, CoinShares said. Importantly, a combination of price appreciation and inflows brought Solana’s assets under management (AUM) to $97 million — 5th largest of all digital assets — while bitcoin’s AUM and ethereum’s AUM stood largest at $37,215 million and $14,914 million respectively. Solana was trading at $159.60 at the time of filing this report with a market cap of $47.4 billion, as per data from CoinMarketCap.

However, bitcoin’s inflows remained flat for the week with a paltry $0.2 million while ethereum saw minor outflows totalling $6.3 million. Volumes in investment products grew 143 per cent since their lows in early July to $3.8 billion, the report noted. This rise in volumes and inflows indicated that investors are now beginning to be more active following the seasonal summer gloom. CoinShares added that the trend of diversification remains intact amongst investors with inflows into cardano, multi-asset, XRP, and polkadot totalling $3.5 million, $3.2 million, $3.1 million, and $1.7 million respectively.

Solana’s origin date back to 2017 when founder Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper draft about a new timekeeping technique for distributed systems called Proof of History (PoH), according to messari.io. He believed that the technique can automate the transaction ordering process for blockchains as one of the limitations to scalability in bitcoin and ethereum is the time need to reach a consensus on the order of transactions.

2021-09-15,CNBC,House Democrats’ plan would close tax loophole used by crypto investors,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/14/house-democrats-plan-would-close-tax-loophole-used-by-crypto-investors-.html,"That means bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin and other popular crypto investments would be subject to the anti-abuse rules, which apply to stocks, bonds and other securities.

The bill would impose ""wash sale"" rules on commodities, currencies and digital assets, according to an outline issued by the House Ways and Means Committee.

Wash sale rules prevent investors from reaping tax benefits from a losing investment and then immediately buying back the same asset.

The IRS treats crypto as property, not as a security, which is how the asset class escapes the rules.

Crypto investors reap two benefits as a result: They can sell crypto for a loss and claim a tax benefit. (That loss can reduce or eliminate capital gains tax on winning investments.) Then, they can quickly buy back the crypto they sold to capture any rebound in price — which isn't far-fetched given crypto's volatility.

Subjecting crypto and other assets to wash sale rules would raise $16.8 billion over a decade, according to estimates published Monday by the Joint Committee on Taxation.

The measure is among a series of tax reforms Democrats are considering to raise money for climate investments and a significant expansion of the U.S. social safety net, expected to cost up to $3.5 trillion.

Overall corporate and individual tax reforms outlined Monday would raise almost $2.1 trillion over a decade.

Using that logic, stocks traded on an exchange, NYSE or otherwise, are not considered one and the same either,"" Johnson said.

Mr Bawa stated this while delivering his keynote address Monday at the 38th Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime, themed, ‘Economic Crime-Who pays and who should pay?’

Mr Bawa said many criminals now play significant roles in crypto-currency markets.

He said the virtual currencies had become their preferred mediums of transaction for illegal monies.

EFCC’s spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, who captured some highlights of the event in a statement, quoted Mr Bawa as saying, “The developments in new technologies and the growth of cryptocurrencies portrays a far greater danger to the world economy than ever before with many criminals playing significant roles in crypto-currency markets.

“Criminals now elect to transact or receive illegal monies (such as ransom money) for cyber-attacks in cryptocurrencies with Bitcoins and Ethereum as the most commonly used mediums for these exchanges.”

He lamented that “the sophistication and complexity that defines the dynamics of economic crime in the 21st Century continues to evolve, spurred by technological advancement in the global economy that has become borderless and transnational.”

This he said had “inevitably led to the prioritisation of law enforcement action on crimes that drive Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) across the globe”.

Mr Bawa also added that “economic crimes which are largely illegal acts committed for private gain affect the vital structures of global economies, causing significant damage to the Global Financial System and depriving developing nations of the needed resources for sustainable development”.

He noted that developed countries are not immune to the scourge, which, according to him, has “magnified with the proliferation of cyber-crimes which threatens the stability of Global Financial Institutions.”

Mr Bawa said the platform of the event provided an opportunity to interrogate the challenges of economic crimes.

“As the victims of crime continue to suffer globally from the effects of financial crimes, either directly or indirectly as part of a social system, the determination of who pays or who should pay becomes a critical measure of the criminal justice system in place.”

He underlined the imperatives of an impartial judiciary in ensuring that “the perpetrators of acts and not the victims pay for their crimes.”

Mr Bawa also highlighted some of the transparency and accountability achievements of the current administration by President Muhammadu Buhari.

He pointed out that the EFCC, as the rallying point in the fight against economic crimes in Nigeria, has recorded important milestones in investigations, prosecutions and assets recovery.

He said “Since its establishment in 2003, the Commission has recorded no less than 3,500 convictions and recovered assets of significant value including properties in Nigeria, the UK, USA, and the UAE. All these have measurably contributed to the national efforts against economic crimes in Nigeria.”

The EFCC boss charged participants to come up with practical solutions to curb the international threat of economic crimes.

Meanwhile, the chairperson of the symposium, Saul Froomkin, thanked the EFCC boss for his insightful presentation, and the support received from Nigeria in organising the event.

Participants at the symposium were drawn from law enforcement and security agencies, accountability institutions and partners across the world.

SAN SALVADOR: El Salvador on Tuesday became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, a real-world experiment proponents say will lower commission costs for billions of dollars sent home from abroad but which critics warned may fuel money laundering.The plan spearheaded by the young, charismatic and popular President Nayib Bukele is aimed at allowing Salvadorans to save on $400 million spent annually in commissions for remittances, mostly sent from the United States.Last year alone remittances to El Salvador amounted to almost $6 billion, or 23% of its gross domestic product, one of the highest ratios in the world.Polls show Salvadorans are skeptical about using bitcoin and wary of the volatility of the cryptocurrency that critics say could increase regulatory and financial risks for financial institutions. Still, some residents are optimistic.""It's going to be beneficial ... we have family in the United States and they can send money at no cost, whereas banks charge to send money from the United States to El Salvador,"" said Reina Isabel Aguilar, a store owner in El Zonte Beach, some 49 km (30 mi) southwest of capital San Salvador.El Zonte is part of the so-called Bitcoin Beach geared toward making the town one of the world's first bitcoin economies.In the run-up to the launch, the government has already been installing ATMs of its Chivo digital wallet that will allow the cryptocurrency to be converted into dollars and withdrawn without commission, but Bukele on Monday looked to temper expectations for quick results and asked for patience.""Like all innovations, El Salvador's bitcoin process has a learning curve. Every road to the future is like this and not everything will be achieved in a day, or in a month,"" Bukele said on Twitter, a platform he often uses to talk up his achievements or excoriate opponents.On Monday, El Salvador bought its first 400 of the cyrptocurrency, temporarily pushing prices for bitcoin 1.49% higher to more than $52,680. The cryptocurrency has been notoriously volatile. Just this spring, it rose over $64,000 in April and fell almost as low as $30,000 in May.Some analysts fear the move to make bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar could muddy the outlook for El Salvador's quest to seek a more than $1 billion financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).After Bukele's bitcoin law was approved, rating agency Moody's downgraded El Salvador's creditworthiness, while the country's dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.But Bukele, who does not shy away from controversy, on Monday retweeted a video that showed face superimposed on actor Jaime Foxx in a scene from Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino's film about American slavery.

Several other global exchanges are considering coming to India despite the lack of regulations on crypto and concerns about an unfavourable regulatory environment.

""We believe we are taking a calculated risk,"" said Rathi.

The government was set to present a bill to parliament by March that proposed a ban on cryptocurrencies, making trading and holding them illegal. But the bill was not tabled in the session and there is uncertainty about the government's plans.

2021-09-11,The Guardian,"The disastrous voyage of Satoshi, the world’s first cryptocurrency cruise ship",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/sep/07/disastrous-voyage-satoshi-cryptocurrency-cruise-ship-seassteading,"On the evening of 7 December 2010, in a hushed San Francisco auditorium, former Google engineer Patri Friedman sketched out the future of humanity. The event was hosted by the Thiel Foundation, established four years earlier by the arch-libertarian PayPal founder Peter Thiel to “defend and promote freedom in all its dimensions”. From behind a large lectern, Friedman – grandson of Milton Friedman, one of the most influential free-market economists of the last century – laid out his plan. He wanted to transform how and where we live, to abandon life on land and all our decrepit assumptions about the nature of society. He wanted, quite simply, to start a new city in the middle of the ocean.

Friedman called it seasteading: “Homesteading the high seas,” a phrase borrowed from Wayne Gramlich, a software engineer with whom he’d founded the Seasteading Institute in 2008, helped by a $500,000 donation from Thiel. In a four-minute vision-dump, Friedman explained his rationale. Why, he asked, in one of the most advanced countries in the world, were they still using systems of government from 1787? (“If you drove a car from 1787, it would be a horse,” he pointed out.) Government, he believed, needed an upgrade, like a software update for a phone. “Let’s think of government as an industry, where countries are firms and citizens are customers!” he declared.

The difficulty in starting a new form of government, said Friedman, was simply a lack of space. All the land on Earth was taken. What they needed was a new frontier, and that frontier was the ocean. “Let a thousand nations bloom on the high seas,” he proclaimed, with Maoish zeal. He wanted seasteading experiments to start as soon as possible. Within three to six years, he imagined ships being repurposed as floating medical clinics. Within 10 years, he predicted, small communities would be permanently based on platforms out at sea. In a few decades, he hoped there would be floating cities “with millions of people pioneering different ways of living together”.

Politics would be rewritten. The beauty of seasteading was that it offered its inhabitants total freedom and choice. In 2017, Friedman and the “seavangelist” Joe Quirk wrote a book, Seasteading, in which they described how a seasteading community could constantly rearrange itself according to the choices of those who owned the individual floating units. (Quirk now runs the Seasteading Institute; Friedman remains chair of the board.) “Democracy,” the two men wrote, “would be upgraded to a system whereby the smallest minorities, including the individual, could vote with their houses.”

In the decade following Friedman’s talk, a variety of attempts to realise his seasteading vision were all thwarted. “Seavilization,” to use his phrase, remained a fantasy. Then, in October 2020, it seemed his dream might finally come true, when three seasteading enthusiasts bought a 245-metre-long cruise ship called the Pacific Dawn. Grant Romundt, Rüdiger Koch and Chad Elwartowski planned to sail the ship to Panama, where they were based, and park it permanently off the coastline as the centrepiece of a new society trading only in cryptocurrencies. In homage to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of bitcoin’s mysterious inventor (or inventors), they renamed the ship the MS Satoshi. They hoped it would become home to people just like them: digital nomads, startup founders and early bitcoin adopters.

Their vision was utopian, if your idea of utopia is a floating crypto-community in the Caribbean Sea. No longer was seasteading a futuristic ideal; it was, said Romundt, “an actual ship”. The Satoshi also offered a chance to marry two movements, of crypto-devotees and seasteaders, united by their desire for freedom – from convention, regulation, tax. Freedom from the state in all its forms. But converting a cruise ship into a new society proved more challenging than envisaged. The high seas, while appearing borderless and free, are, in fact, some of the most tightly regulated places on Earth. The cruise ship industry in particular is bound by intricate rules. As Romundt put it: “We were like, ‘This is just so hard.’”

As with many stories about techno-libertarian fantasies, the tale of the Satoshi begins in an all-male, quasi-frat house in San Francisco in the late 90s. Romundt – a softly spoken Canadian with the optimistic, healthy glow of someone who combines entrepreneurial success with water sports – was living with a bunch of software engineers, all of whom shared an intense dedication to personal improvement. “I was a huge Tony Robbins fan,” Romundt told me in one of several Zoom calls from his office in Panama. (Robbins’ themes of individual freedom, self-mastery and the accrual of significant wealth are evident from the titles of his books from that time: Unlimited Power; Lessons in Mastery; Unleash the Power Within; The Power to Shape Your Destiny, and, next level, Awaken the Giant Within.)

After his San Francisco stint, Romundt, the son of a hairdresser, created ScissorBoy in 2009, a popular online TV series on hairdressing, and then ScheduleBox, a website which offered a digital receptionist service for hairstylists to book in their clients. (Always digitally inclined, he had, according to his website, the world’s “most advanced mobile paperless office in 1995”.) “I used to work 17 hours a day, so I didn’t have a lot of freedom,” he told me. He did, however, make enough money to semi-retire in 2016 and then spent “no more than five hours a month” running his business. The giant fully awakened, he moved back to Canada, where he lived on a houseboat on Lake Ontario and went kayaking in the mornings as the sun came up. Enraptured by his lifestyle, Romundt wondered why everyone wasn’t living this way. On a flight one day, he saw a man wearing a T-shirt with “Stop arguing. Start seasteading” printed on it. Romundt was curious, they got talking, and the man turned out to be Joe Quirk, who was by this time running the Seasteading Institute.

So far, the Seasteading Institute had experienced variable, or zero, success with its projects. Early ideas for a “Baystead” and “Coaststead” off the coast of San Francisco and a “Clubstead”, a resort off the coast of California, never made the leap to reality. An attempt to create a floating island prototype in French Polynesia in 2017 met with fairly fierce resistance from the people of French Polynesia and collapsed a year later when the government pulled out of the scheme.

After meeting Quirk, Romundt decided he wanted to try again. Quirk introduced him to two other aspiring seasteaders, the passionately libertarian American Elwartowski and the bitcoin-wealthy German engineer Koch. Together, the trio founded a company, Ocean Builders. Using their own money, they funded the first attempt at a single residential seastead, in the form of a floating white octagonal box 12 nautical miles off the coast of Thailand. Elwartowski and his girlfriend, Nadia Summergirl, lived there for two months in early 2018, until the Thai government discovered the seastead’s existence and declared it a threat to the country’s independence, possibly punishable by life imprisonment or death. Elwartowski and Summergirl had to flee the country before the Thai navy dispatched three ships to dismantle the floating box.

The seasteading movement did not die there. In 2019, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski moved their company to Panama, where they had found a government willing to back their next project: the SeaPod. These would be individual floating homes held 3 metres above the water by a single column and a tripod-shaped base beneath the ocean. The man responsible for their design, Koen Olthuis, is a Dutch “aquatect”, an architect specialising in water-based schemes. In rendered drawings, the SeaPods look fantastical, like a giant’s white helmet emerging monstrously from the waves. Inside, every surface is curved, as if you were living within the smooth, colourless confines of a peppermint. Romundt compared the SeaPods to the architecture in The Jetsons, the 60s cartoon where the characters lived in glassy orbs in the sky. “It’s like that,” he told me, “but on water.” The team built a factory from scratch in Linton Bay, a marina on the north coast of Panama, hired a team of about 30 engineers and mechanics, and, in early 2020, began building the first SeaPod prototype.

Progress was slow. Even once they had a successful prototype, Romundt predicted the factory would only make two SeaPods a month. They’d had the idea before of buying a cruise ship – a quick way of scaling up the community – but the cost had always been prohibitive. By autumn 2020, though, the situation had changed. Like many parts of the travel industry, the cruise ship business was collapsing because of the pandemic: multiple cruise lines were going into administration, empty ships filling up ports like abandoned cars in a scrubby field, or being sent to the scrapyard. Cruise ships, the Ocean Builders trio realised, would be going cheap.

Sure enough, they found a bargain. In October 2020, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski bought the ex-P&O cruise ship Pacific Dawn for a reported $9.5m. (Built in 1991 for $280m, the ship could have sold pre-pandemic for more than $100m, one industry insider told me.) They instructed Olthuis to draw up the plans, placing the ship at the heart of a floating community surrounded by SeaPods. “We had a kind of funny idea,” Olthuis told me. In his scheme, the Satoshi would connect, via two looping tunnels on the water, to human-made floating platforms designated for agriculture, manufacturing and parkland. From the air, the whole community would form the shape of the bitcoin B.

The scheme had the support of the Panama government. In fact, the Ministry of Tourism hoped that a new ocean community would be a draw for visitors. In a page-long statement, the ministry told me how a floating development fitted in with its Sustainable Tourism Masterplan 2020-2025, by highlighting the country’s biodiversity and “the blue heritage of Panama”. It didn’t seem to mind the idea of a load of crypto-investors floating off their coastline, not paying any tax.

“Out of adversity comes opportunity, so they say,” wrote Elwartowski, on 10 October 2020, introducing Viva Vivas, the new company that he had created to run the Satoshi. Its name was adapted from the Latin phrase, “vive ut vivas”, meaning “live so that you may live”.

Ten days later, he announced the venture on Reddit: “So, I am buying a cruise ship and naming it MS Satoshi … AMA.” The responses were quick (“Need an apprentice aviation mechanic?” “I know how to use a yo-yo! Any room for me??”) and included the inevitable sceptics. (“Anyone remember the good old days of the Fyre festival?”) But plenty took the proposition seriously and wanted to go over the small print. (“Where is power coming from? Gas? Internet? Food? Water? Toiletries? What taxes will she be subject to?”)

Elwartowski answered every question with grave attention to detail. There would be generators at first, followed quickly by solar power. This would be an eco-friendly crypto-ship. High-speed wireless internet would come from land; utilities would be included in the fees at first, but would be metered when the systems were upgraded: “You don’t want to have pay for someone else’s mining rig in their cabin,” he wrote, referring to the resource-intensive computational process that introduces new crypto “coins” into the system. As for tax, you would not pay any on earnings made from ventures based in territory beyond Panama. You would be free to make, or mine, as much money as you liked. It would be a remote worker’s regulatory paradise.

But as the Reddit Q&A continued, Elwartowski’s meticulous responses revealed some of the more knotty practicalities of life on board. It turned out that the only cooking facilities would be in the restaurant. For safety reasons, no one was allowed to have a microwave in their rooms – though some cabins had mini-fridges, noted Elwartowski, determinedly sidestepping the point. He offered residents a 20% discount at the restaurant and mentioned that some interested cruisers had already talked about renting part of the restaurant kitchen so they could make their own food. “We want entrepreneurs to come up with solutions and try them out,” he wrote, in a valiant attempt to convert a fairly fundamental stumbling block into wild startup energy. “This is your place to try new things.” Not all the Redditors were convinced. “No microwave but mining rig. Incoherent scam.”

Marketing of the Satoshi soon began in earnest. Her 777 cabins were to be auctioned off between 5 and 28 November, while the ship was crossing the Atlantic towards Panama. Viva Vivas listed the options, including cabins with no windows ($570 a month), an ocean view ($629), or a balcony ($719). Ocean Builders held a series of live video calls for potential customers which attracted 200 people at a time, Olthuis told me, with Romundt, an expert steward of the multilateral video call, at the helm.

On the Viva Vivas website, a Frequently Asked Questions page covered the basics of the cabin auction process, fees and logistics. Specially trained staff would be hired to keep the ship Covid-free and through a partnership with a platform called coinpayments.net, multiple cryptocurrencies would be supported for payment, including bitcoin, ethereum, digibyte, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dai, dash, ethereum classic, trueUSD, USD coin, tether, bitcoin SV, electroneum, cloak, doge, eureka coin, xem and monero.

The final entry on the FAQ page, regarding the possibility of having pets on board, gave a bracing insight into the tension between the idea of freedom and the reality of hundreds of people closely cohabiting on a cruise ship. The answer linked to a separate document, containing a 14-point list of conditions including one that declared no animal should exceed 20lbs in weight, and any barking or loud noises could not last for longer than 10 minutes. If a pet repeatedly disturbed the peace – more than three times a month or five times in a year – it would no longer be allowed to live on board. “Any pet related conflict,” instructed point 13, “shall be resolved in accordance with Section V (F) of the Satoshi Purchase Agreement or Section IV (F) of the Satoshi Master Lease, where applicable.” Dogs would only be permitted in balcony cabins, and it was advised that owners buy a specific brand of “porch potty”, a basket of fake grass where your pet could relieve itself. (Pet waste thrown overboard would result in a $200 fine.)

One Reddit respondent – maxcoiner on Reddit, Luke Parker in real life – was as close to the target market of the Satoshi as it was possible to imagine. A longtime follower of the seasteading movement, he was also such an early and successful bitcoin adopter that he and his wife were able to retire early thanks to their investments. The Satoshi was the most plausible idea for a seastead he’d ever heard. “I did not buy a room during the Satoshi’s sale window,” he told me over email, “but it was hard to keep my hand off that button.”

A variety of considerations held him back. “The wife,” as he put it, had her doubts. He wasn’t sure about the “ginormous leap down in luxury” from living in deep residential comfort on land in the US midwest to living in a very small cabin on board a 30-year-old cruise ship. He was worried, too, by the limited facilities – “No kitchen of my own? Tiny bathrooms? Tiny everything?” Also, the constant rocking of the ship on the water: “I just can’t stomach that life around the clock.” He preferred the idea of the SeaPods. If Parker was going to live on a boat, he concluded, he’d prefer to buy his own luxury catamaran.

On 29 November, Elwartowski published another post on the Viva Vivas website, announcing the official opening of the Satoshi in January 2021. “This will be a new experience for all of us so we must manage your expectations,” he warned. The novelty was too much for Parker. “It takes a rare kind of person indeed to move your life on to a deserted cruise ship in Central America with so little information up front,” he told me. If Parker, part of that highly select, freedom-seeking, system-abandoning, overlapping community of seasteaders and bitcoiners, wasn’t going to buy, it was hard to imagine who would. As he put it: “This may have been the smallest sales demographic in history.”

Over 30 years of service, the Satoshi herself had seen enough of the world to know every permutation of life at sea – apart, perhaps from what it might be like to be a permanent home to 2,000 crypto-investors. Built in 1991 in the Fincantieri shipyard in Trieste, Italy, she is one of only two cruise ships designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. (The other, the Crown Princess, was sent to the scrapyard last year, a Covid casualty.) Her first incarnation was as the Regal Princess (owned by Princess Cruises), after which she became the Pacific Dawn (P&O Australia). Throughout her life, she has been admired for her distinctive features: a domed roof rising above the navigation bridge, water slides that curl round her funnel and a stern whose elegantly rounded form is in marked contrast to the blunt, sawn-off rears of some giant cruise liners. Those who prefer an understated cruising experience also appreciate her discreet size: compared to the largest cruise ship in the world, The Symphony of the Seas (18 decks, 23 swimming pools) she is a modest vessel (11 decks, two swimming pools).

For many years, the Pacific Dawn cruised the south Pacific, enjoying a serene phase of life, interrupted only by an onboard swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the time she lost power and came within 70 metres of crashing into the Gateway Bridge on the Brisbane River. In 2011, a devoted Facebook group was established by fans. “Dawnie was the party ship,” remembered one. “I fell in love with my wife all over again,” added another, crediting the ship for his romantic renewal. Then, in 2020, it briefly looked as though Dawnie was set to join her sister on the scrapyard, after her sale to British cruise company, Cruise and Maritime Voyages, collapsed in the pandemic. Her fans were grief-stricken, weeping emojis piling up on the Facebook group. (“Well 2020 just became even shittier,” said Kathie.) When it was revealed that the ship had been rescued by Ocean Builders, there was a wave of relief, if a little mystification at her new name. “She’ll always be Dawn to me.”

On 29 October 2020, Dawn began her journey to Panama, sailing from Limassol, Cyprus to Piraeus, Greece. A week later, she was handed over to her new owners Ocean Builders and officially became the Satoshi. Koch flew over from Panama to cross the Atlantic aboard their new purchase. The team hired a management company, Columbia Cruise Services, to run the ship and provide a minimum crew of about 40 people, mostly Ukrainian, including a cook, engineers and cleaning staff. A seasoned British cruise captain, Peter Harris, arrived to take charge. “We didn’t know anything about running a cruise,” Romundt told me, “so it was like, we didn’t want to have to figure all this stuff out.”

As soon as Capt Harris joined the ship and met Koch on board, he realised there would be challenges ahead. “I was thinking a week into the job, I can see I’m going to be resigning,” Harris told me, immaculate in a striped shirt on a video call from his home in Kent. Koch, he said, was admirable in his ambition, and a likable, law-abiding man, but he was naive about how shipping worked and had an abhorrence of rules. “He didn’t understand the industry,” said Harris, who has the frank, upbeat air of a born leader for whom hierarchy is a kind of creed. “He just thought he could treat it like his own yacht.”

To sail anywhere, Harris explained, a ship requires certificates of seaworthiness. These expired on the day the deal with P&O was completed. Usually, a new buyer would ensure they lasted a couple of months to cover any onward journey, but no one on the Ocean Builders side had checked. By the time Columbia Cruise Services came on board and informed the team of the situation, the contracts had all been signed. Before the Satoshi could cross the Atlantic, the team were obliged to sail the ship to Gibraltar and have her removed from the water, a process known as dry-docking, to perform essential repairs and renew the certificates.

The Atlantic crossing began on 3 December. Harris – who didn’t resign, grateful for the four-month contract mid-pandemic – found it oddly lovely. With only 40 or so people on board, rather than the usual 2,000-odd, the atmosphere was relaxed, if a little surreal. Among other things, P&O had left about 5,000 bottles of wine and 2,000 bottles of spirits on board. Harris asked Koch if he wanted to charge the crew for drinks, but Koch, generous by nature, said no. “Obviously, we restricted them to three drinks a day,” said Harris. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had a crew.”

As the crossing continued, questions about how the project would actually work once the Satoshi arrived in Panama grew more pressing. According to Harris, Elwartowski thought he could convince the Panamanian authorities to let the ship anchor permanently in its waters and de-register as a ship, becoming a floating residence instead, so as to avoid some of the more exacting requirements of maritime law. But while Panama was happy to have the ship moored off its coast, it specified that the ship had to remain officially designated as a ship. Which led to another difficulty: the discharge of sewage. Though the ship had an advanced wastewater management system, which could turn sewage into drinking-quality water, they were not permitted to discharge this wastewater into Panamanian waters, and so would have had to sail 12 miles out every 20 days or so to empty tanks into international waters.

Such obstacles made the ship an off-putting proposition for insurers. No one would agree to cover them. “They wouldn’t even tell us why we weren’t insurable, they just kept saying no,” Romundt said. “It’s kind of hard to remedy something if you don’t know what the problem is.” Of the several insurance experts I asked about this, none were willing to comment on the case, citing a lack of expertise, presumably because no one had ever tried to insure a cruise ship turned floating crypto-community before. Harris, however, had his theories: that a risk-averse insurance industry was wary of both a bitcoin business and a ship that would presumably be mostly populated by quick-to-litigate Americans.

After trying multiple insurers and brokers, Romundt began to realise that the cruise ship industry was, as he put it, “plagued by over-regulation”. (Along with airlines and nuclear power, according to Harris, it’s in “the top three”.) The Ocean Builders’ great freedom project, whose intrinsic purpose was to offer an escape from oppressive rules and bureaucracy, was being hobbled by oppressive rules and bureaucracy. As Elwartowski would reflect a few months later on Reddit: “A cruise ship is not very good for people who want to be free.”

To Romundt, the whole cruise ship business began to seem like an impenetrable old boys’ network. He estimated that, given six months, they could have hired a crack marine legal team and navigated a way through the loopholes. But by mid-December, the Satoshi was already halfway across the Atlantic, burning through gallons of diesel, with a 40-person crew they’d have to keep on board even when she was stationary in Panama because a cruise ship requires constant maintenance. A ship can cost, even when docked, up to $1m a month to run. “Because, you know,” said Romundt, “it’s huge.”

Fuel alone was costing the Ocean Builders trio about $12,000 a day. According to Harris, Koch wanted to try to make the ship more fuel-efficient by installing a smaller engine, which he thought he could do while the ship was at anchor. “We were like, how are you going to cut a hole in the ship’s side big enough to get the engine out, which is below water level, and not sink the ship?” Harris shook his head, his memories of Koch clearly fond, if perplexed. “I was forever saying, ‘No, Rudi you can’t do this; no, Rudi you can’t do that.’”

Before the Satoshi hove into view of the white sands of a Panama beach, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski had to make a call. They couldn’t afford to keep the ship moored and empty for months on end while they tried to solve the insurance problem, a problem they weren’t even sure they’d be able to solve. They were insured to sail her, and they could go on sailing her, but they didn’t want to run a travel company. They wanted to run a floating society of like-minded freedom-lovers arranged in the shape of the bitcoin B. It wasn’t even clear that there were enough people who wanted to do that. Koch admitted to Harris that the cabins weren’t selling.

“It was almost like a fantasy, James Bond-ish,” said one cruise industry insider. “But to their credit they believed in it.”

The dream was over, they realised, before it had even begun. The project was dead, except it wasn’t quite, as they still owned the ship, which was still steaming across the Atlantic with Koch, Harris and the crew on board. The Satoshi, already thousands of miles into a 5,500-nautical-mile voyage, had travelled too far to be turned around mid-ocean, so on she sailed. They’d have to sell her, the Ocean Builders realised, but who was going to be crazy enough to buy a cruise ship in the middle of a pandemic? Only a company who wanted to tear her apart. On 18 December, while she was still at sea, the team announced the sale of the Satoshi to a scrapyard in Alang, India. The Satoshi was once again destined for dismemberment.

On 19 December, Elwartowski announced on the Viva Vivas website that the Satoshi’s journey was coming to an end. “We have lost this round. The New Normal, Great Reset gains another victim,” he wrote, looping in the collapse of the Satoshi with a popular Covid conspiracy theory that the pandemic and its response had been stage-managed by a global elite. (Over subsequent months, Elwartowski’s activity on Reddit would include other Covid themes, including suspicion of government vaccination programmes.) Romundt emailed their list of potential customers to let them know the ship’s fate. Deposits for cabins would be refunded.

The Satoshi arrived in Balboa, Panama on 22 December. On Christmas Eve, she anchored off the coast of Colon. There, Romundt joined Koch and the crew on the ship. Elwartowski, meanwhile, stayed in Panama City. “He didn’t want to get on board,” said Romundt. Koch spoke to Joe Quirk one evening on the phone while he was sitting in the ship’s cafe drinking a bottle of wine, feeling regretful that the onboard hospital he’d planned to open to medical entrepreneurs would never come to life. Even so, Koch was “utterly unbowed”, reported Quirk in a Seasteading Institute blog post entitled How the Grinch Stole the Cruise Ship.

Romundt, a man more driven by the practical issues at hand than the romantic symbolism of his endeavours, realised that, though the entire plan had fallen apart, he was still the part-owner of a massive cruise ship. He decided to spend Christmas on board, along with the crew. Master key in hand, he wandered around the Satoshi, making sure to enter every room that said Do Not Enter. He toured the engine room, and sat on the sun deck. He worked, because he can’t help working, even at Christmas, but he also went on all the water slides, alone. (Harris told me he’d turned them on specially for Christmas Day.) Though Romundt doesn’t usually drink, he had a glass of wine and called all his friends saying, “I’m on my own cruise ship for Christmas!” He had the kind of good time it is perhaps only possible to have when you have just made an unbelievably expensive mistake born of a desire to invent an entirely new way of living and involving the purchase of a huge floating vessel. “I was king of the ship!” he said, still delighted.

Even scrapping the Satoshi proved to be a debacle. After a deal had been done with the Indian scrapyard, the Ocean Builders team realised that according to the Basel Convention, which covers the disposal of hazardous waste, they weren’t allowed to send the ship from a signatory country (Panama) to a non-signatory country (India). The contract with the scrapyard had to be cancelled.

All was not completely lost, at least for the Satoshi herself. The cruise ship industry is a compact ecosystem. The grapevine did its thing. A ship broker heard about the plight of the Satoshi, realised it was precisely the kind of ship a new client of his was looking for, and did a quick deal.

The client was Ambassador Cruise Line, the first British cruise company to launch for 10 years. According to Ambassador’s ebullient, red-sweatered chair, Gordon Wilson, the company’s name is intended to reflect the highly optimistic idea that ambassadors, like cruise ships, take the best of their own culture with them wherever they go. The Satoshi would be the first ship in the company’s new fleet, which would offer cruises to the over-50s. Many of the new team at Ambassador had come over from Cruise and Maritime Voyages, who had nearly bought the Satoshi before it went bust in 2020. As such, they knew the ship well, which sped up the sale. Wilson wouldn’t confirm the amount – “they thought it was a good price” – but the trade press reported that Ocean Builders sold her for $12m, more than they paid for her, though possibly not quite enough to cover the elaborate costs of running an empty cruise ship for three months.

On 23 February 2021, the Satoshi set sail from Panama, heading all the way back across the ocean she’d just crossed. She arrived in Bar, Montenegro on 27 March. Wilson went over to visit her, and, like Romundt, relished the experience of climbing aboard his new asset. Exploring the engine rooms of an empty cruise ship seemed to give these men a particular sensation: perhaps just the buzz of owning something so vast and powerful; a mechanical, proprietary thrill.

The Ocean Builders team, meanwhile, returned to their own private missions. Elwartowski was on sabbatical, Romundt told me. He did not want to talk to me for this story. Koch, who also declined to be interviewed, was building his own boat in Panama, and working with Romundt on the SeaPods. Over Zoom, Romundt gave me a tour of the SeaPod factory, and showed off the hulking sheets of fibreglass that would form the structure’s mould. “It feels like touching a UFO,” he said, stroking his invention.

Seeing the pod’s nascent form, I felt a boringly pragmatic urge to ask Romundt what happened if, once afloat, you needed to buy a pint of milk. My question seemed to miss the point, too wedded to old-fashioned notions of locality and human connection. The Pods had been designed to have a hatch in the roof, Romundt said. He was talking to some drone creators and imagined people flying to their pods independently, landing on the roof and entering through the hatch. Perhaps that’s how you’d get your milk.

At her new home in Montenegro, meanwhile, the Satoshi needed some sprucing up. For the fourth time in her three decades on the water, she had been renamed. “We thought Ambience a lovely name for a ship,” said Wilson, pronouncing it in the French style, Ambi-ence. “This is a very elegant ship,” he added, proudly. “She looks like a cruise liner; she does not look like a floating block of flats.”

When Ambience finally sets sail on her maiden voyage, from the industrial dock of Tilbury across the North Sea to Hamburg in April 2022, she will offer a more traditional experience to her passengers. “Back to what cruising is all about,” said Wilson. The atmosphere will be refined. There will be promenading on deck and plentiful opportunities for photography as the horizon swallows the evening sun. There will be cocktails at the bar, a five-course dinner and a glittery show. It is unlikely bitcoin will be accepted as currency. The water slides will be removed.

This article was amended on 8 September 2021 to include the full name of Ambassador Cruise Line, and to clarify that the Ambience’s dinners will have five courses, not three.","('https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9a64a665016b5916e57cfc3c43ff4dada669f8e/0_261_2750_1649/master/2750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa6a88e32b4f67b2d8a4e4fec1f44c1c',)",22 min read,"But converting a cruise ship into a new society proved more challenging than envisaged.

Visa, the multinational payments giant, has announced it is planning to bring cryptocurrency services to traditional banking platforms in Brazil. The company also announced that it is working with several cryptocurrency companies in the country to bring cryptocurrency payment cards to the market and hinted at a possible direct integration of bitcoin in payments.

Visa Gears Up for Crypto Integration in Brazil

Credit card giant Visa has announced it plans to integrate cryptocurrency solutions into traditional banking platforms. Eduardo Abreu, Visa’s vice president of new business in Brazil, stated the company has plans to develop applications (APIs) to unite traditional banks with cryptographic products. In this way, it would be possible to make investments in cryptocurrencies and ETFs within banking platforms with no intermediates.

Visa also announced it is working with several national companies to issue cryptocurrency cards. Among these are Zro Bank, Alterbank, and Rippio, which will allow users to connect these to bank accounts. The Visa executive did not comment on a possible ETA for these developments.

B2B Developments, Direct Bitcoin Payments, and NFTs

Visa revealed that they are also working on a B2B (business-to-business) oriented blockchain that will allow payment settlement among companies using smart contracts. Abreu stated that the system was already in testing phases with some of their customers, and that the company would have more announcements in this regard in the future. This system would enhance transparency in payments among providers and suppliers, allowing everyone with access to the system to verify payments and deposits.

Visa also stated they will start testing direct bitcoin payments in the country. This means that transactions will allow bitcoin to be transferred to other accounts directly. This is completely different than what happens now with most crypto cards, where there has to be an intermediary that exchanges bitcoin for fiat money on the fly.

The inclusion of direct bitcoin payments will facilitate the payment process and eliminate these intermediaries. In March, the CEO of Visa in Brazil stated it expects to implement this functionality sometime this year. Abreu stated there was also an NFT initiative in the works for Brazil. Visa has already jumped onto the NFT bandwagon by purchasing a Cryptopunk, a digital avatar on the Ethereum network, for $165K in ether, in August.

Highlights Cryptocurrency: Investors are treating them for long-time investment

Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency: Coin has earned a high mining rate since its inception

Cryptocurrency is barely a speculative investment these days. Retail and institutional investors are taking the digital assets very seriously. With so much going around the digital currency, investors are treating them as useful for not only short-term profits but also for long-time investment. But which ones should you choose to invest in? To make it easier for you, we discuss some crypto coins that have been topping the market cap charts time and again. Considering their relative stability, these could be good choices for a long-term investment. (Also Read: Meet ""The Jedi Master Of Crypto"": He Has Also Invested In Indian Start-Up)

Below are details about come cryptocurrencies:

1) Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency. Its valuation is increasing as more investors are endorsing this ‘digital gold'. The most vital factor behind its prized value is the maximum limit of its coins: 21 million.

2) Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum or ether is almost always in competition with Bitcoin, Ethereum or ether. Its share in the crypto market recently rose from 18 per cent to 20 per cent. It is a decentralised blockchain platform that cuts out third parties.

3) Cardano (ADA)

Cardano is also a decentralised blockchain platform that uses a native cryptocurrency. It enables secure peer-to-peer transactions. There are plans to enable smart contracts on it very soon.

4) Uniswap (UNI)

This currency already allows the use of smart contracts. It facilitates automated transactions with tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

5) Dogecoin (DOGE)

The coin has earned a high mining rate since its inception. It's still on the speculative stage and hasn't crossed the dollar mark. However, it has a larger circulation and unlimited capacity to mine more.

6) Binance Coin (BNB)

Like Bitcoin, it has a limit on the number of tokens that it circulates: 200 million coins. It also follows a quarterly routine of destroying or ""burning"" much of its currency around the year. These are major reasons for its soaring value.

7) Polkadot (DOT)

This currency provides a bridge for networks so that many applications built on Polkadot can also work on Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, it is more scalable and faster.

Bitcoin is undergoing the biggest test in its 12-year history as El Salvador becomes the first country to adopt it as legal tender Tuesday. Both enthusiasts and detractors of crytocurrencies will be monitoring the experiment to see if a significant number of people want to transact with Bitcoin when it circulates alongside the U.S. dollar, and whether it brings any benefits to the violent, impoverished Central American nation.

The country bought 400 bitcoins ahead of the roll-out, with a market value of about $20 million at current prices. The country plans to buy ""a lot more"" of them, President Nayib Bukele said via Twitter, after buying the first batch of 200.

If the experiment is a success, other countries may follow El Salvador's lead. Its adoption will get an initial boost from the government's Bitcoin wallet Chivo, which comes pre-loaded with $30 worth of the currency for users who register with a Salvadoran national ID number.

Businesses will be required to accept Bitcoin in exchange for goods and services and the government will accept it for tax payments. The plan is the brainchild of El Salvador's 40-year old president, who says it will draw more people into the financial system and make it cheaper to send remittances.

""This is brave new world stuff,"" said Garrick Hileman, head of research for the Miami-based Blockchain.com. ""We are in unchartered waters with this launch, but I'm glad to see this experiment happen overall, and I think we'll learn a lot from it.""

Bitcoin ATMs

A pedestrian opens a door to a Chivo Bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM) booth at Gerardo Barrios plaza in San Salvador, El Salvador, on Saturday, August 28, 2021. El Salvador began installing Bitcoin ATMs, allowing its citizens to convert the cryptocurrency into U.S. dollars and withdraw it in cash, as part of the government's plan to make the token legal tender.

Mr Bukele's administration has installed 200 Bitcoin ATMs around the country that can be used to exchange the cryptocurrency for U.S. dollars. The Finance Ministry created a $150 million fund at state-run bank Banco de Desarrollo de la Republica de El Salvador, Bandesal, to back the transactions.

The dollar will remain the national currency for public accounting purposes and merchants who are technologically unable to receive the e-currency will be exempt from the law, the government has said.

El Salvador's dollarized economy is heavily reliant on remittances sent home by migrants overseas, which totalled $6 billion last year and account for roughly a fifth of gross domestic product. Mr Bukele says Bitcoin could save Salvadorans $400 million a year in fees for these transactions.

Public Skepticism

While Mr Bukele himself enjoys approval ratings of more than 80 per cent, a poll last week by El Salvador's Universidad Centroamericana Jose Simeon Canas found his Bitcoin law is widely unpopular. Two-thirds of respondents said the law should be repealed while more than 70 per cent said they prefer to use U.S. dollars instead.

The International Monetary Fund warned of the risks of using Bitcoin, which lost nearly half its value from April to May, and the World Bank declined a request from El Salvador's government to help the government adopt it, citing environmental and transparency drawbacks. The Bitcoin news also helped trigger a selloff of El Salvador's dollar bonds, though they have since pared losses.

""Crypto is sexy but untested and complicated especially for a country like El Salvador,"" Stifel Nicolaus & Co. managing director Nathalie Marshik said. ""It's extremely risky, and there is the question of, is the Bandesal fund big enough? The regulations look like the law, put together really quickly. It's a big question mark.""

Watching Closely

While the Bahamas launched its own central bank-backed digital currency this year, the Sand Dollar, and Venezuela has its own e-money called the Petro, these are very different from a decentralized cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, whose users value its independence from governments and central banks.

Other governments in the region will be watching closely. Last month, Cuba moved to legalize cryptocurrency already being used on the island, while lawmakers in other countries such as Panama and Uruguay have proposed similar legislation.

Bitcoin's adoption comes as the country's top court presided over by Mr Bukele allies ruled last week that the president can run for a second term. The U.S. criticized the decision and said it damages bilateral relations between the two nations.

2021-09-11,FXStreet,Cryptocurrencies: Shut ’em down,https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/cryptocurrencies-shut-em-down-202109062253,"I continue to react to the hype and promotion of cryptocurrencies with horror and disbelief as traditional, seemingly reputable companies enter into crypto-related activities. As an economist, part of me gets it, but the better part of me rues these developments.

The purported rationale for cryptocurrencies is to democratize commerce by eliminating the oversight and involvement of government and traditional banking institutions. I don’t buy it. To me, this rationale is little more than a smoke screen, serving as a way for crooks and charlatans to launder money or fleece the ill-informed.

Developers of these digital currencies clearly saw an opportunity. They granted themselves generous allocations of their creations in the hopes of getting rich when the mania of a broader public pushed the prices of these cryptocurrencies up to unsustainable levels. I’m sure that for many, those hopes were realized, well beyond any expectations — to my dismay. I wish the broader public knew better; but, alas, that seems not to be the case. The cryptocurrency originators were betting that the “get rich quick” ethic would to be overriding; and so far, that bet seems to be paying off.

Given the growth in the volume of cryptocurrency transactions, it’s not hard to understand why financial institutions would want to set themselves up as cryptocurrency dealers. Dealing is a classic business activity that plays an essential role in a host of security and commodity markets. Dealers buy from willing sellers in their customer base at the bid price and sell to willing buyers at the offer price, thereby earning a bid/offer spread. The flow of customer orders would thus be expected to generate an attractive source of income. What’s not to like?

Similarly, if cryptocurrency markets can mature to the point where intermediaries can take in deposits at a lower interest rate and make loans at a higher rate, this business would also make sense (and profits). Bankers in dollar-denominated deposits and loans do this kind of activity all day long. It should be understood, however, that these institutions and those activities differ significantly from the buy and hold mentality that drives the speculative component of cryptocurrency markets.

If the institutions that function as intermediaries are smart (as I expect most professionally run firms are), they will arrange their businesses with as little exposure to the underlying cryptocurrency markets as they possibly can. The risk of a devaluation for a large inventory holding is simply too severe. Of course, the danger is that without adequate oversight, some portion of these firms won’t be well run; and they’ll take inordinate risks that could destabilize our financial infrastructure.

Sorry to say, but one of the most disturbing statements I’ve recently heard about cryptocurrencies came from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. When asked about the prospect of developing a government-sanctioned cryptocurrency, Chairman Powell said, “…you wouldn’t need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital U.S. currency — I think that’s one of the stronger arguments in its favor.” Need!? The only ones who need cryptocurrencies are crooks and charlatans. And the last thing America needs is for the US government to get in on this racket!

Besides facilitating criminal activity, these markets require an ongoing usage of energy that is unconscionable. CNet reports, for instance, that warehouses of Bitcoin mining rigs run 24 hours a day, consuming more power than the whole of Argentina. And Bitcoin is just a single cryptocurrency, albeit the most popular one. Literally thousands of different cryptocurrencies can currently be traded, making the above measure of energy use a low-end estimate. Are we really ready to turn a blind eye to this level of energy consumption in light of everything we know about climate change? And for what? To make a handful of people millionaires while at the same time abetting criminal activity? I don’t think so.

Let’s not overlook a recent evolution. A further development in this area is the advent of cryptocurrencies that are pegged to (i.e., exchangeable with) the US dollar. Originators of such instruments clearly recognize that the extreme volatility of untethered cryptocurrencies makes them untenable media of exchange. This second-generation cryptocurrency is supposed to address that issue by stabilizing the convertibility to the US dollar. If that’s your concern, however, why not just stick to dollars in the first place. The answer is obvious: reliance on the US dollars is problematic for those who want to evade the law.

(I must admit, the idea of establishing a market for something that is supposed to be exchangeable with the US dollar seems nuts on economic grounds. Why should anyone ever be willing to pay more — or receive less — than a dollar for this coin? It makes no sense to me.)

Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler may be the most visible public figures who appear to share some concerns about the dangers of cryptocurrency markets, publicly; but I’m afraid their likely remedies don’t go far enough. Both appear to be looking to impose a higher degree of regulatory oversight, when the best course of action would be to shut cryptocurrencies down, altogether.","('https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Cryptocurrencies/crypto_matrix-637516561995093295_Large.jpg',)",4 min read,"The purported rationale for cryptocurrencies is to democratize commerce by eliminating the oversight and involvement of government and traditional banking institutions.

Amid looming fervor over El Salvador's historic bitcoin adoption measure, the cryptocurrency market rallied to its highest level in nearly four months on Monday afternoon, with a slew of so-called altcoins (or cryptocurrency alternatives to bitcoin and ether) surging to meteoric new highs and fueling gains that have prompted JPMorgan analysts to warn current crypto mania suggests the market may be ripe for a correction.

Bitcoin's market share is sitting at ""uncomfortably low"" levels—a historical sign of market ... [+] frothiness, JPMorgan analysts warned Monday. Getty Images

Key Facts

Heading up gains among top cryptocurrencies, the price of Solana's sol token skyrocketed nearly 19% to an all-time high of $164.47, extending a weeks-long rally driven by the cryptocurrency's support for buzzy non-fungible tokens. Other top tokens leading the rally included Ripple's XRP and Chainlink—up about 7% apiece—while recently high-flying cryptocurrencies like Cardano's ada and dogecoin fell about 3% and 1%. Though it's been underperforming the broader market in recent weeks, the price of bitcoin ticked up about 2% Monday to surpass $52,000 for the first time in nearly four months. Nigel Green, the CEO of $12 billion wealth advisory DeVere Group, chalked up the gains to anticipation over bitcoin's debut as legal tender in El Salvador on Tuesday, calling it a ""landmark moment in the evolution of digital currency."" In a Monday note to clients, however, JPMorgan Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said retail investors have been propelling altcoins to new highs since early August and pointed out bitcoin and ethereum's share of the market has fallen from 78% on August 4 to about 67% amid waning institutional interest in funds tied to the two top cryptocurrencies. He points out bitcoin's share of the market in particular looks ""uncomfortably low"" by historical standards—a likely reflection of ""froth and retail investor mania,"" as opposed to sustainable gains.

Crucial Quote

""The August rally in non-fungible tokens and the pickup in decentralized finance activity have helped not only ethereum but also alternative cryptocurrencies that facilitate or plan to facilitate smart contracts, such as Solana, Binance Coin and Cardano,"" Panigirtzoglou said Monday. ""The previous phase of retail investors’ mania into cryptocurrency markets was between the beginning of January and mid-May... and retail investors are making cryptocurrency markets look frothy again."" After the bouts of retail-investing mania in January and May, crypto markets crashed about 13% and 50%, respectively.

Tangent

All told, the value of the world's cryptocurrencies jumped nearly 2% Monday to a total of about $2.3 trillion, marking its highest level since days after prices started crashing from all-time highs in early May, according to crypto data website CoinMarketCap.

Surprising Fact

In a matter of months, cryptocurrency markets plunged more than 85% after altcoins' market share reached an all-time high of 55% in January 2018, Panigirtzoglou notes.

Key Background

Alongside the buzz around NFTs, ongoing institutional adoption and heightened inflationary concerns have helped the cryptocurrency market pare back losses since regulation in China sparked a nearly 50% crash in early May. The market is still down about 10% from its all-time high, but it’s skyrocketed more than 45% over the past month. According to research from crypto hedge fund Nickel Digital, 49% of money managers (who have a collective $275.5 billion in assets) believe institutions will turn to cryptocurrencies for the first time this year to hedge against the threat of inflation, which is growing at its quickest pace in nearly 13 years.

Etherum competitor Solana — a decentralized blockchain platform – is now the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in the world ahead of Dogecoin. Its SOL token has jumped 3.3X in price in three weeks from $43 on August 15 to $145, at the time of filing of this report, as per CoinGecko. On the other hand, its market cap has grown from $14.6 billion to $42 billion in comparison to the $40.5 billion market cap of Dogecoin. Solana’s market cap is currently $21 billion short of the $63 billion market cap of XRP – the sixth largest cryptocurrency. However, according to expert, Solana’s speed to process transactions and lower cost is yet to be proven in the real world. According to its website, the average cost per transaction is $0.00025. “Solana is the fastest blockchain in the world and the fastest-growing ecosystem in crypto,” it said.

“We are in a bull market where the government is printing notes like paper. This is creating significant value to fixed supply assets like Bitcoin and Gold. But having this flood of new users joining the community is hunting for cryptos to get rich. Solana is an alternative to Ethereum with faster speed and lower costs. But it still has to prove in the real world. A sudden growth like this is a dangerous situation, but at the same time, it’s an opportunity for traders,” Kumar Gaurav, Founder & CEO, Cashaa told Financial Express Online.

Solana Labs, the developer of Solana blockchain had announced a $314 million funding round in June led by venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital. Alameda Research, Blockchange Ventures, CMS Holdings, others had also participated.

According to messari.io, Solana’s origin date back to 2017 when founder Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper draft about a new timekeeping technique for distributed systems called Proof of History (PoH). He believed that the technique can automate the transaction ordering process for blockchains as one of the limitations to scalability in Bitcoin and Ethereum is the time need to reach a consensus on the order of transactions. Its competitor Ethereum is currently the second-largest crypto after bitcoin with a market cap of $462 billion. It is currently trading at $3,940, according to CoinGecko.

2021-09-11,The Guardian,FCA warns over crypto assets pushed by stars such as Kim Kardashian West,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/06/fca-crypto-assets-kim-kardashian-west-ethereum-max-instagram,"The City watchdog has issued a warning about the risks of buying crypto assets promoted by social media influencers such as Kim Kardashian West, and said people with little understanding of the risks were buying into digital currencies for fear of missing out.

In a warning that appeared to be targeting younger investors, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) cautioned against buying into the “hype” of cryptocurrencies, particularly new tokens backed by celebrities that may end up being fake.

“The hype around them generates a powerful fear of missing out from some consumers who may have little understanding of their risks,” the FCA chair, Charles Randell, said in a speech prepared for the Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime on Monday. “There is no shortage of stories of people who have lost savings by being lured into the crypto bubble with delusions of quick riches, sometimes after listening to their favourite influencers, ready to betray their fans’ trust for a fee.”

A surprisingly large proportion of consumers who buy into speculative cryptocurrencies wrongly believe they are regulated, Randell said. He stressed that consumers have no financial protection if they invest in cryptocurrencies and will not have access to its Financial Services Compensation Scheme if they lose their cash.

“If you buy them, you should be prepared to lose all your money,” Randell said, repeating an earlier warning from the FCA.

In his speech, Randell cited the example of the US TV star Kardashian West, who earlier this year was criticised for posting a paid promotion of a cryptocurrency token called Ethereum Max to her Instagram stories, where she asked her 250 million fans: “Are you guys into crypto????”. While the post was marked as an advertisement, Randell said Kardashian did not disclose that the token was created only a month earlier by unknown developers.

“Of course, I can’t say whether this particular token is a scam,” Randell said. “But social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation. Some influencers promote coins that turn out simply not to exist at all.”

The chairman called for greater powers to govern the online promotion of crypto assets to combat the flood of “problematic content”. He said it was difficult for regulators to stand by while consumers, and sometimes very vulnerable people, were putting their financial futures in jeopardy. About 2.3 million people in the UK currently hold speculative digital tokens, with 14% using credit to buy them, putting them at risk of greater financial losses.

However, he said the decision on whether to regulate was not straightforward, and could result in the legitimisation of cryptocurrencies or give consumers a false sense of security. “Will the involvement of the FCA give them a ‘halo effect’ that raises unrealistic expectations of consumer protection?” Randell said.

He admitted that it would take a “great deal of careful thought” to craft appropriate regulation. But, in the meantime, the FCA should be given powers to crack down on misleading cryptocurrency promotions, even if they do not regulate the asset directly. The FCA is waiting for the Treasury to release its recommendations after a months-long consultation on the matter last year.

The FCA chairman also appeared to back calls by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which consists of regulators from the world’s leading financial centres, to force banks to put aside enough capital to cover 100% of potential losses if they decide to hold crypto assets. The proposal is meant to avoid putting the wider financial system at risk should the value of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin suddenly collapse.

Bitcoin, the world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency, scaled $50,940 (roughly Rs. 37.23 lakhs) on the day. On Monday (September 6) afternoon, the price of the cryptocurrency touched $51,809.55 (roughly Rs 37.87 lakh). This is the highest climb for the crypto token since May when it had started declining after reaching a record high of $65,000 (roughly Rs 47.51 lakh). Over the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has risen 8 percent.

Bitcoin's rise above $50,000 on Monday comes just a day ahead of El Salvador's plan to recognise the cryptocurrency as legal tender. In June, a proposal by the South American nation's President Nayib Bukele to embrace the cryptocurrency had received approval. The law will take effect tomorrow (September 7).

Before this, after consolidating for a few months since May on August 23, Bitcoin had touched $50,505 (roughly Rs. 36.91 lakhs). In the last couple of weeks, since August 23, Bitcoin had been trading between $46,500 and $50,000 (roughly Rs. 34 lakh to Rs. 37 lakh). Bitcoin price in India at 6pm on September 6 was around Rs. 39,60,000.

Ether, too, joins rally

On the back of Bitcoin's revival from its rout in May, Ether the crypto coin that had slumped along with a widespread cryptocurrency market crash in May also touched $4,000 (roughly Rs. 2.92 lakh) on Friday (September 3). This was the first time since May that Ether crossed the $4,000-mark. Ether's strong run began after its London upgrade last month. On Friday, the cryptocurrency traded at $4,025 (roughly Rs. 2.94 lakh). However, it slipped marginally on Monday, (September 6) trading at $3,944 (roughly Rs. 2.88 lakh). In the past 7 days, the digital asset has risen about 25 percent. Ethereum price in India at 6pm on September 6 was around Rs. 3,00,000.

What about other altcoins?

Alongside, Bitcoin and Ether, there are a few other altcoins, too, vying for their place in the limelight. Cardano, the number 3 coin in the world, has touched $2.91 (roughly Rs. 213). In the past 7 days, two other altcoins, Polkadot and Solana, have also risen by about 36 and 45 percent, respectively. At the time of writing, while Polkadot was trading at $35.01 (roughly Rs. 2,559), Solana was at $143.87 (roughly Rs. 10,516).

Will Bitcoin break the September jinx?

If you look at the history, September has not been favourable for Bitcoin's growth. In six of the past eight years, the cryptocurrency has had negative returns in this month. Will 2021 see a reversal in its fortune? Well, the month has just about begun, but one can only remain optimistic that the jinx will be broken this time round.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_disco_reuters_1622203490843.jpg',)",2 min read,"Bitcoin, the world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency, scaled $50,940 (roughly Rs.

2021-09-11,Gadgets 360,Ethereum Rival Solana Jumps to 7th Spot in Cryptocurrency Top 10,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/solana-sol-cryptocurrency-price-value-investment-trading-ethereum-bitcoin-rival-top-10-crypto-token-virtual-currencies-2531684,"The cryptocurrency linked to the Solana network has jumped to seventh spot among the world's top 10 largest virtual coins amid optimism that the blockchain could be a long term competitor to Ethereum.

Solana's SOL token has tripled in about three weeks and now has a market value of more than $41 billion (roughly Rs. 2,99,640 crores), according to CoinGecko. Proponents tout the claimed speed and lower cost of transactions on Solana for decentralised finance and digital collectibles, applications where Ethereum dominates. Ether price in India stood at Rs. 2.97 lakhs as of 5:30pm IST on September 6.

“Solana has a growing ecosystem, projects are being built on it, and it's benefited hugely from the mania that's taking place in NFTs,” Antoni Trenchev, co-founder at crypto lender Nexo, wrote in an email. NFTs are non-fungible tokens used to trade digital collectibles. He said the backing of crypto figure Sam Bankman-Fried - chief executive of crypto exchange FTX - is helping.

Solana bills itself as the world's fastest blockchain and its website says the average cost per transaction is $0.00025 (roughly Rs. 0.018). In June it announced that it had raised $314 million (roughly Rs. 2,290 crores) in a funding round with investors including Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and CoinShares.

Late last month, Jump Trading-affiliated crypto market data provider Pyth Network went live on Solana's mainnet, a development that's expected to help bolster the world of decentralised finance. There are plans for it soon to be able to broadcast market data through the so-called Wormhole Network.

“It's becoming too big to ignore and offers a different smart contract solution to Ethereum,” Jonathan Cheesman, head of over-the-counter and institutional sales at FTX, wrote in an email.

So-called alternative coins like Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA, and Binance Coin have surged in recent weeks, taking some of the limelight from top tokens Bitcoin and Ether in a broad crypto revival from a May rout. Bitcoin has also rallied and came close to $52,000 (roughly Rs. 38 lakhs) on Monday. Cardano price in India stood at Rs. 216, Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 39.06 lakhs as of 5:30pm IST on September 6.

Skeptics argue the technological upgrades propelling some tokens may not justify the scale of the rallies.

Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian are putting investors at risk by advertising crypto tokens, a UK regulator said.

The chair of the Financial Conduct Authority said online influencers regularly promote crypto scams.

Kardashian advertised a crypto token called ethereum max on her Instagram account in June.

The UK's financial watchdog has said celebrities such as Kim Kardashian are putting retail investors at risk by pushing obscure crypto tokens.

Kardashian advertised the little-known cryptocurrency ethereum max to her more than 200 million Instagram followers in June.

In a speech on the difficulties of regulating crypto, the chair of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said Kardashian's post was probably the financial promotion with the single biggest audience reach in history.

Yet he said it was a prime example of how celebrity influencers can lure investors toward coins that could turn out to be scams. Paris Hilton and DJ Khaled are among the numerous other celebrities to have promoted crypto projects.

""In line with Instagram's rules, [Kardashian] disclosed that this was an ad,"" Charles Randall told the Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime on Monday.

""But she didn't have to disclose that ethereum max - not to be confused with ethereum - was a speculative digital token created a month before by unknown developers - one of hundreds of such tokens that fill the crypto-exchanges.""

Randall added: ""Of course, I can't say whether this particular token is a scam. But social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation. Some influencers promote coins that turn out simply not to exist at all.""

The FCA chair said regulators should have more powers over the crypto world, with a focus on disreputable cryptocurrency promotions and the risks arising from regulated financial businesses trading in unregulated digital tokens.

Randall also raised the concern that regulating cryptocurrencies could give them too much legitimacy in the eyes of consumers. Yet he concluded that more rules are needed, although he said it will take ""a great deal of careful thought to craft a regulatory regime"" for crypto.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/61360382a1e5e7001996ea4f?format=jpeg',)",2 min read,"Kim Kardashian promoted an unknown crypto token to her followers in June.
