Investing.com – Major cryptocurrencies were mixed on Monday with Bitcoin breaking to cycle highs and Ethereum remaining subdued under $4,000.

Late on Sunday, broke above $51,100, which was the 61.8% Fibonacci level from the April high to July low, to move above $52,000 to its highest level since 12th May.

Since then, Bitcoin has pared some of the gains to trade back below $51,500.

El Salvador soon to adopt Bitcoin

All eyes in the world of cryptocurrencies are on El Salvador, which on Tuesday will become the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender.

The policy, introduced by President Nayib Bukele, will allow the population to shop, buy property and land, and pay taxes in Bitcoin.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) previously said adopting Bitcoin as legal tender could put the financial system at risk. The two parties are currently in discussions over a new loan.

The country will have its own digital Bitcoin wallet, called Chivo, with every user receiving $30 worth of Bitcoin for free. There will also be Chivo ATMs that will allow users to convert their fiat currency into Bitcoin and vice-versa.

Other cryptocurrencies

Other major cryptocurrencies are mixed with failing to reclaim $4,000 after breaking back above the level on Friday for the first time since May. The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been on a strong run in recent weeks, rising 35% in August and 14% in September so far.

The third largest cryptocurrency, , has also taken a breather after a recent strong run of gains took the coin above $3.00 for the first time.

However, it hasn’t been slow going for all the cryptocurrencies involved in Decentralised Finance (DeFi) applications. , which is now the seventh largest cryptocurrency, has resumed its upward momentum after a 5% decline on Saturday.

The Ethereum-rival has risen from around $36 at the beginning of August to over $150.","('https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/c23071e9372bf85e319ac8767bac2464_w_800_h_450.jpg',)",none

Bitcoin, the world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency, scaled $50,940 (roughly Rs. 37.23 lakhs) on the day. On Monday (September 6) afternoon, the price of the cryptocurrency touched $51,809.55 (roughly Rs 37.87 lakh). This is the highest climb for the crypto token since May when it had started declining after reaching a record high of $65,000 (roughly Rs 47.51 lakh). Over the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has risen 8 percent.

Bitcoin's rise above $50,000 on Monday comes just a day ahead of El Salvador's plan to recognise the cryptocurrency as legal tender. In June, a proposal by the South American nation's President Nayib Bukele to embrace the cryptocurrency had received approval. The law will take effect tomorrow (September 7).

Before this, after consolidating for a few months since May on August 23, Bitcoin had touched $50,505 (roughly Rs. 36.91 lakhs). In the last couple of weeks, since August 23, Bitcoin had been trading between $46,500 and $50,000 (roughly Rs. 34 lakh to Rs. 37 lakh). Bitcoin price in India at 6pm on September 6 was around Rs. 39,60,000.

Ether, too, joins rally

On the back of Bitcoin's revival from its rout in May, Ether the crypto coin that had slumped along with a widespread cryptocurrency market crash in May also touched $4,000 (roughly Rs. 2.92 lakh) on Friday (September 3). This was the first time since May that Ether crossed the $4,000-mark. Ether's strong run began after its London upgrade last month. On Friday, the cryptocurrency traded at $4,025 (roughly Rs. 2.94 lakh). However, it slipped marginally on Monday, (September 6) trading at $3,944 (roughly Rs. 2.88 lakh). In the past 7 days, the digital asset has risen about 25 percent. Ethereum price in India at 6pm on September 6 was around Rs. 3,00,000.

What about other altcoins?

Alongside, Bitcoin and Ether, there are a few other altcoins, too, vying for their place in the limelight. Cardano, the number 3 coin in the world, has touched $2.91 (roughly Rs. 213). In the past 7 days, two other altcoins, Polkadot and Solana, have also risen by about 36 and 45 percent, respectively. At the time of writing, while Polkadot was trading at $35.01 (roughly Rs. 2,559), Solana was at $143.87 (roughly Rs. 10,516).

Will Bitcoin break the September jinx?

If you look at the history, September has not been favourable for Bitcoin's growth. In six of the past eight years, the cryptocurrency has had negative returns in this month. Will 2021 see a reversal in its fortune?

press release

PRESS RELEASE. Leading Crypto service comparison site – Cryptowisser deep dives into the environmental future of cryptocurrency. Despite major scrutiny from traditional media and press, cryptocurrency possibly remains more environmentally friendly than traditional banks, just no one is reporting it.

Crypto community anticipates a green future.

With the crypto world under constant scrutiny from a variety of sources, the last thing they need are accusations for ruining the earth. While mining bitcoin is very energy intensive, the crypto community are constantly working to improve their carbon footprint.

As far as environmental revelations are concerned, the future seems to lie in the use of Proof of Stakes systems Vs Proof of Work. Although several coins have already migrated over from Proof of Work systems, many still exist.

The Cryptowisser report details how Proof of Work systems and specifically their security measures require an astronomical amount of energy. The principles of a PoW system require individuals to manage the process of recording transactions and verifying data stored in the block chain, which in turn requires crypto mining and requires a lot of computing hardware.

Proof of Systems on the other hand maintain their transactions with multiple holders, which are called validators, and with this Proof of systems protocol, each user creates a node, and each node does not require additional energy to prove the credibility of the node, as opposed to Proof of Work systems.

The report also explains the lack of scrutiny in many “traditional” industries, including banks. While it is indeed true that the crypto industry needs to reassess their environmental impact, it could be argued that they are the only financial vertical to receive such speculation, while traditional banks, who consume an incredible amount of energy go unscathed.

Cryptowisser is a cryptocurrency services comparison site with the world’s largest, most frequently updated and most trusted lists of cryptocurrency exchanges, news, wallets, debit cards and merchants. With more than 1,000 reviews of the various exchanges, debit cards, wallets and merchants, they help you make all of your purchasing decisions and service choices in the crypto world.

NurPhoto/Getty Images

Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian are putting investors at risk by advertising crypto tokens, a UK regulator said.

The chair of the Financial Conduct Authority said online influencers regularly promote crypto scams.

Kardashian advertised a crypto token called ethereum max on her Instagram account in June.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The UK's financial watchdog has said celebrities such as Kim Kardashian are putting retail investors at risk by pushing obscure crypto tokens.

Kardashian advertised the little-known cryptocurrency ethereum max to her more than 200 million Instagram followers in June.

In a speech on the difficulties of regulating crypto, the chair of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said Kardashian's post was probably the financial promotion with the single biggest audience reach in history.

Yet he said it was a prime example of how celebrity influencers can lure investors toward coins that could turn out to be scams. Paris Hilton and DJ Khaled are among the numerous other celebrities to have promoted crypto projects.

""In line with Instagram's rules, [Kardashian] disclosed that this was an ad,"" Charles Randall told the Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime on Monday.

""But she didn't have to disclose that ethereum max - not to be confused with ethereum - was a speculative digital token created a month before by unknown developers - one of hundreds of such tokens that fill the crypto-exchanges.""

Randall added: ""Of course, I can't say whether this particular token is a scam. But social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation. Some influencers promote coins that turn out simply not to exist at all.""

The FCA chair said regulators should have more powers over the crypto world, with a focus on disreputable cryptocurrency promotions and the risks arising from regulated financial businesses trading in unregulated digital tokens.

Randall also raised the concern that regulating cryptocurrencies could give them too much legitimacy in the eyes of consumers. Yet he concluded that more rules are needed, although he said it will take ""a great deal of careful thought to craft a regulatory regime"" for crypto.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/61360382a1e5e7001996ea4f?format=jpeg',)",none
2021-09-06,The Guardian,FCA warns over crypto assets pushed by stars such as Kim Kardashian West,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/06/fca-crypto-assets-kim-kardashian-west-ethereum-max-instagram,"The City watchdog has issued a warning about the risks of buying crypto assets promoted by social media influencers such as Kim Kardashian West, and said people with little understanding of the risks were buying into digital currencies for fear of missing out.

In a warning that appeared to be targeting younger investors, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) cautioned against buying into the “hype” of cryptocurrencies, particularly new tokens backed by celebrities that may end up being fake.

“The hype around them generates a powerful fear of missing out from some consumers who may have little understanding of their risks,” the FCA chair, Charles Randell, said in a speech prepared for the Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime on Monday. “There is no shortage of stories of people who have lost savings by being lured into the crypto bubble with delusions of quick riches, sometimes after listening to their favourite influencers, ready to betray their fans’ trust for a fee.”

A surprisingly large proportion of consumers who buy into speculative cryptocurrencies wrongly believe they are regulated, Randell said. He stressed that consumers have no financial protection if they invest in cryptocurrencies and will not have access to their Financial Services Compensation Scheme if they lose their cash.

“If you buy them, you should be prepared to lose all your money,” Randell said, repeating an earlier warning from the FCA.

In his speech, Randell cited the example of the US TV star Kardashian West, who earlier this year was criticised for posting a paid promotion of a cryptocurrency token called Ethereum Max to her Instagram stories, where she asked her 250 million fans: “Are you guys into crypto????”. While the post was marked as an advertisement, Randell said Kardashian did not disclose that the token was created only a month earlier by unknown developers.

“Of course, I can’t say whether this particular token is a scam,” Randell said. “But social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation.

2021-09-06,Todayuknews,African Economist Says Regulated Cryptocurrencies Are Reasonable Alternative to Single Trade Currency – Emerging Markets Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/african-economist-says-regulated-cryptocurrencies-are-reasonable-alternative-to-single-trade-currency-emerging-markets-bitcoin-news/,"A Nigeria-based research and development economist, Gospel Obele, has called “for a unified regulatory mechanism for cryptocurrency trading.” He adds that such regulation of cryptocurrencies can potentially “complement an African digital currency,” hence this needs to be considered.

Cryptocurrencies Show the Way

In remarks published by Joy Online, Obele insists that cryptocurrencies have already shown how a single currency must function. The economist explained:

Crypto has been able to build a level of singular markets when it comes to digital currency use and trade across borders, and this is a significant philosophy which the [African Continental Free Trade Area] originates. One of the significant issues that the AFCTA presents is an important opportunity for a singular currency in the African Market. We all know because of the different development stages of financial markets in respective member states. Related Articles Lessons PR Professionals Can Take from the Online Casino Industry

American investors inclined to buy crypto with credit card, new study reveals

Obele, however, concedes that the adoption of a single digital currency by all African states seems impossible in the short term and may prove to be “very much demanding over time.” Yet, according to him, it is only such a digital currency that provides a “reasonable alternative to reaching that level of synchronization to facilitate trade activity across borders.”

Crypto Here to Stay

As some African central banks contemplate launching their own digital currencies, privately issued cryptocurrencies are already being used as a medium of exchange in some cross-border trades. For instance, in Nigeria, where there is a shortage of foreign exchange, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are being used as an alternative means of payment. This has helped some import businesses to stay afloat.

However, the growing use of cryptocurrencies when making cross-border payments has seen some central banks impose measures that hinder this practice. Commenting on this, Obele reminded central banks that “cryptocurrency has come to stay.” Therefore, instead of restricting the use of such digital currencies, the economist wants central banks to understand the technology that underpins such digital currencies — the blockchain. He explained:

“So we need to go back to the fundamentals to get things right to be part of the crypto revolution.”

Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian are putting investors at risk by advertising crypto tokens, a UK regulator said.

The chair of the Financial Conduct Authority said online influencers regularly promote crypto scams.

The UK's financial watchdog has said celebrities such as Kim Kardashian are putting retail investors at risk by pushing obscure crypto tokens.

Kardashian advertised the little-known cryptocurrency ethereum max to her more than 200 million Instagram followers in June.

In a speech on the difficulties of regulating crypto, the chair of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said Kardashian's post was probably the financial promotion with the single biggest audience reach in history.

Yet he said it was a prime example of how celebrity influencers can lure investors toward coins that could turn out to be scams. Paris Hilton and DJ Khaled are among the numerous other celebrities to have promoted crypto projects.

""In line with Instagram's rules, [Kardashian] disclosed that this was an ad,"" Charles Randall told the Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime on Monday.

""But she didn't have to disclose that ethereum max - not to be confused with ethereum - was a speculative digital token created a month before by unknown developers - one of hundreds of such tokens that fill the crypto-exchanges.""

Randall added: ""Of course, I can't say whether this particular token is a scam. But social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation. Some influencers promote coins that turn out simply not to exist at all.""

The FCA chair said regulators should have more powers over the crypto world, with a focus on disreputable cryptocurrency promotions and the risks arising from regulated financial businesses trading in unregulated digital tokens.

Randall also raised the concern that regulating cryptocurrencies could give them too much legitimacy in the eyes of consumers. Yet he concluded that more rules are needed, although he said it will take ""a great deal of careful thought to craft a regulatory regime"" for crypto.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/61360382a1e5e7001996ea4f?format=jpeg',)",none
2021-09-06,The Guardian,FCA warns over crypto assets pushed by stars such as Kim Kardashian West,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/06/fca-crypto-assets-kim-kardashian-west-ethereum-max-instagram,"The City watchdog has issued a warning about the risks of buying crypto assets promoted by social media influencers such as Kim Kardashian West, and said people with little understanding of the risks were buying into digital currencies for fear of missing out.

In a warning that appeared to be targeting younger investors, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) cautioned against buying into the “hype” of cryptocurrencies, particularly new tokens backed by celebrities that may end up being fake.

“The hype around them generates a powerful fear of missing out from some consumers who may have little understanding of their risks,” the FCA chair, Charles Randell, said in a speech prepared for the Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime on Monday. “There is no shortage of stories of people who have lost savings by being lured into the crypto bubble with delusions of quick riches, sometimes after listening to their favourite influencers, ready to betray their fans’ trust for a fee.”

A surprisingly large proportion of consumers who buy into speculative cryptocurrencies wrongly believe they are regulated, Randell said. He stressed that consumers have no financial protection if they invest in cryptocurrencies and will not have access to their Financial Services Compensation Scheme if they lose their cash.

“If you buy them, you should be prepared to lose all your money,” Randell said, repeating an earlier warning from the FCA.

In his speech, Randell cited the example of the US TV star Kardashian West, who earlier this year was criticised for posting a paid promotion of a cryptocurrency token called Ethereum Max to her Instagram stories, where she asked her 250 million fans: “Are you guys into crypto????”. While the post was marked as an advertisement, Randell said Kardashian did not disclose that the token was created only a month earlier by unknown developers.

“Of course, I can’t say whether this particular token is a scam,” Randell said. “But social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation. Some influencers promote coins that turn out simply not to exist at all.”","('https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a3a7af4b53f872518df1782a6836f16a8e65045/96_0_3307_1984/master/3307.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=618f0b15f95c9565c5971a74bb165f2a',)",none
2021-09-06,Todayuknews,African Economist Says Regulated Cryptocurrencies Are Reasonable Alternative to Single Trade Currency – Emerging Markets Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/african-economist-says-regulated-cryptocurrencies-are-reasonable-alternative-to-single-trade-currency-emerging-markets-bitcoin-news/,"A Nigeria-based research and development economist, Gospel Obele, has called “for a unified regulatory mechanism for cryptocurrency trading.” He adds that such regulation of cryptocurrencies can potentially “complement an African digital currency,” hence this needs to be considered.

Cryptocurrencies Show the Way

In remarks published by Joy Online, Obele insists that cryptocurrencies have already shown how a single currency must function. The economist explained:

Crypto has been able to build a level of singular markets when it comes to digital currency use and trade across borders, and this is a significant philosophy which the [African Continental Free Trade Area] originates. One of the significant issues that the AFCTA presents is an important opportunity for a singular currency in the African Market. We all know because of the different development stages of financial markets in respective member states. Related Articles Lessons PR Professionals Can Take from the Online Casino Industry

American investors inclined to buy crypto with credit card, new study reveals

Obele, however, concedes that the adoption of a single digital currency by all African states seems impossible in the short term and may prove to be “very much demanding over time.” Yet, according to him, it is only such a digital currency that provides a “reasonable alternative to reaching that level of synchronization to facilitate trade activity across borders.”

Crypto Here to Stay

As some African central banks contemplate launching their own digital currencies, privately issued cryptocurrencies are already being used as a medium of exchange in some cross-border trades. For instance, in Nigeria, where there is a shortage of foreign exchange, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are being used as an alternative means of payment. This has helped some import businesses to stay afloat.

However, the growing use of cryptocurrencies when making cross-border payments has seen some central banks impose measures that hinder this practice. Commenting on this, Obele reminded central banks that “cryptocurrency has come to stay.” Therefore, instead of restricting the use of such digital currencies, the economist wants central banks to understand the technology that underpins such digital currencies — the blockchain. He explained:

“So we need to go back to the fundamentals to get things right to be part of the crypto revolution.”

2021-09-06,NDTV.com,What Are Cryptocurrency ETFs? How Do They Work?,https://www.ndtv.com/business/what-are-cryptocurrency-etfs-and-how-do-they-work-2531517,"There are not many options for investors regarding cryptocurrency ETF

Cryptocurrency exchanges are a nuanced businesses when it comes to trading. That's why some investors prefer trading or owning cryptocurrency through an exchange-traded fund or ETF. In functionality, cryptocurrency ETFs aren't very different from traditional ETFs and widely popular mutual funds. Cryptocurrency ETFs are traded over exchanges like New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the American Nasdaq Stock Market. This form of exchange makes it easier to trade crypto coins. Traditional ETF tracks index or basket of assets. Cryptocurrency ETF, on the other hand, tracks one or more digital tokens.

What is cryptocurrency ETF?

A cryptocurrency ETF is like a fund through which one can access a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrency tokens or coins for investors to trade in. ETFs offer transparency and greater liquidity. This exposes potential shareholders to the token or currency and individual investors can own the token in the crypto market.

With an ETF, an investor won't need to manage multiple digital wallets just for acquiring and tracking different cryptocurrencies.

How does it work?

In traditional ETFs, the fund provider owns assets (stocks or commodities) that are to be tracked. Shares from these are sold to investors. Similarly, an organisation providing cryptocurrency ETF and managing the funds needs to own the underlying assets (a digital token or currency) that it wishes to track.

The fund is exposed for purchase by potential investors. Thereafter, the ownership of these tokens is given as shares. By owning the shares of the fund, investors directly own the tokens.

What are the options for investors regarding cryptocurrency ETF?

Currently, there are not many options for investors regarding cryptocurrency ETF. Several countries, like India, are yet to decide their stand on cryptocurrency. In such a scenario, cryptocurrency ETFs are not even being considered in many parts of the world. However, in the few places where their application has been approved, different platforms provide different sets of services.

Till now, Bitcoin ETFs are the most popular crypto ETFs out there. However, Bitcoin ETFs (like Bitcoin Investment Trust) that work in the US do not directly own the currency. Instead, they own portfolios of stock with exposure to blockchain technology. There are also Blockchain ETFs that adopt blockchain technology to provide cryptocurrency assets to investors. Often, crypto ETFs charge a management charge of around 2 per cent.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/s9ng9nc_cryptocurrrency-generic650_625x300_11_August_21.jpg',)",none

About Cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.

Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain that serves as a public financial transaction database.

2021-09-06,Sky News,Bitcoin: Protests and confusion in El Salvador as country prepares to make cryptocurrency legal tender,https://news.sky.com/story/bitcoin-protests-and-confusion-in-el-salvador-as-country-prepares-to-make-cryptocurrency-legal-tender-12400516,"El Salvador is set to become the first country in the world to make the cryptocurrency Bitcoin legal tender, with a recently passed law to take effect from tomorrow.

President Nayib Bukele has claimed the move would increase financial inclusion, investment, tourism, innovation and economic development.

He added that the use of Bitcoin in the country will be optional, and salaries and pensions will continue to be paid in US dollars.

Image: President Nayib Bukele said the move would generate more jobs and create financial inclusion

Citizens have protested against it, complaining that there has been too little explanation from officials about what benefit Bitcoin will bring and how transactions using the cryptocurrency will work.

Claudia Molina, a 42-year-old who sells T-shirts and souvenirs, criticised the plan.

""We don't know the currency. We don’t know where it comes from. We don't know if it's going to bring us profit or loss. We don’t know anything,"" she told Reuters.

""They haven't given us training. They haven't told us what we're going to use or how to make the change,"" she added.

Foreign cryptocurrency enthusiasts have supported El Salvador's move, with a movement stirring for people to buy $30 in the cryptocurrency together to mark the law coming into effect, potentially driving up the price.

Bitcoin is now trading at more than $51,000 (£37,000) its highest since May, when it fell sharply after China announced curbs on cryptocurrency transactions.

Image: Union members take part in a protest against the use of Bitcoin

El Salvador has begun to install Bitcoin ATMs in cities around the country where citizens will be able to convert their digital tokens into cash, backed by a $150m (£108m) government fund.

Polls have reported that most Salvadorans are opposed to the adoption of Bitcoin, despite the government pledging to provide $30 (£22) in the token to each citizen through a state-provided digital wallet.

Carlos Carcah, a professor at El Salvador's Superior School of Economics and Business, argued that adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender ""is not necessary, nor convenient"".

He added: ""As long as there is someone who accepts payment with Bitcoin, the same as they accept dollars, there wouldn't be problems.""

He noted that Bitcoin is extremely volatile, so investors ""run the risk of becoming rich and the next day being poor"".

El Salvador's own currency, the Salvadoran colon, was replaced by the US dollar in 2001.

The country depends heavily on money which citizens based abroad, often in the US, send home and these remittances to El Salvador were worth almost $6bn in 2019, amounting to 16% of El Salvador's gross domestic product.

The country moved to using the US dollar as legal tender as a result of these remittances, and the move to Bitcoin is based on an expectation that more Salvadorans will begin sending money home using the cryptocurrency.","('https://e3.365dm.com/21/09/1600x900/skynews-bitcoin-el-san-salvador_5502581.jpg?20210906102042',)",none
2021-09-06,FXStreet,"Ethereum layer-two solutions in the spotlight as ETH price eyes $5,000",https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/ethereum-layer-two-solutions-in-the-spotlight-as-eth-price-eyes-5-000-202109061017,"Ethereum price continues to consolidate as it prepares to breach $4,000 and climb higher.

ETH layer two and adoption continue to progress in the right direction after the recent London hard fork.

A retest of the all-time high at $4,372 is plausible if ETH bulls remain optimistic.

Ethereum price is coiling up after tagging a crucial psychological level. Investors can expect ETH to shoot higher as the overall outlook of the cryptocurrency market remains optimistic. In a highly bullish case, the smart contract token will likely set up a new all-time high.

Adoption and post-hard fork developments

From shifting the algorithm to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) via the recently introduced London hard fork to having multiple solutions to its scalability issues, Ethereum has come a long way. Arbitrum, a layer-two scaling solution from Offchain Labs, recently announced that it had secured funding worth $120 million in a Series B round.

This raise was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and others like Pantera Capital, Alameda Research, billionaire Mark Cuban and Polychain capital.

The announcement added,

Offchain Labs built its platform in response to an increasing need for scaling Ethereum without compromising on the security of Ethereum as the base layer.

More importantly, Arbitrum has EVM compatibility, allowing developers and projects to deploy without changing the code in their contracts.

On a similar note, Polygon adoption is pushing to new heights with the recent integration of Dharma, which is inadvertently helping ETH scale.

While layer-two solutions are becoming more efficient, Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake and the London hard fork are active efforts to further improve the scalability of the ETH blockchain without compromising its security and decentralization.

The recent protocol upgrade and the significant strides that the Ethereum Foundation is making aim to improve the scalability of the entire blockchain by retaining its security and decentralization. Although this is a bullish development in the long run, it will take ETH a while to feel the effects of deflation.

While it will take time, ETH is already retesting, hovering below the $4,000 level in attempts to breach it. So far, roughly $834 million worth of ETH has been burnt. As this process continues, Ethereum price will face a supply shock, pushing Ethereum price higher.

Although the smart contract token comes close to the $4,000 psychological level, retail investors show no real interest as gas prices hover around 102 GWEI.

Ethereum price faces temporary slowdown

Ethereum price broke out of its month-long consolidation above the $3,000 level on August 31. Since this breakout, ETH has rallied nearly 25% and is currently restarting another phase of congestion.

As this sideways movement consolidates, volatility and buying pressure continue to increase. Investors can expect a sudden burst in bullish momentum that pushes Ethereum price to $4,071. A decisive close above this resistance level will open the path for a retest of the all-time high at $4,372.

If the bullish momentum persists, market participants can expect ETH to set up a new all-time high at $4,700. In some extreme cases, ETH might also tag the $5,000 psychological level.

ETH/USDT 1-day chart

Supporting this ascent and a new all-time high is IntoTheBlock’s Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) model, which shows little to no resistance present in ETH’s way.

Roughly 1.16 million addresses that purchased 1.74 million ETH at an average price of $3,909 are also in the clear as ETH is attempting to breach $4,000.

ETH GIOM chart

Additionally, the supply on exchanges has been on a drastic decline over the past two weeks. From August 23 to September 5, roughly 2.35% of ETH has left centralized exchange wallets, signaling a bullish outlook.

ETH supply on exchanges chart

Interestingly, despite the recent uptick in price, the ETH funding rate is hovering around 0.07%. A high funding rate is often the sign of an overleveraged market, which could exacerbate potential sell-offs.

The current funding rates suggest that the retail investors are taking it slow, which is a sign of a healthy uptrend and does not forecast any sudden crashes.

ETH funding rate chart

Things are looking optimistic for Ethereum price and show no signs of slowing down. A decisive close above $4,372 will undoubtedly open a resistance-free path for ETH and propel it higher.

On the other hand, even a 15% correction to $3,345 would not put ETH in harm’s way. Still, a lower low below $3,223 will plant the seeds of doubt and probably scare off weak investors.

If the selling pressure pushes Ethereum to shatter the August 26 swing low at $3,027, it will invalidate the bullish thesis. In such a case, market participants can expect Ether to explore lower territory.","('https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Digital Currencies/Ethereum/ethereum_2_Large.jpg',)",none
2021-09-06,NDTV Gadgets 360,Chinese Clampdown on Cryptocurrencies Is Reportedly Forcing Mining Firms to Leave With Their Computers,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-ban-china-mining-companies-leaving-country-bitcoin-production-nodes-computers-2531295,"China, which accounted for more than half of global Bitcoin production until a few months ago, banned payment companies and other financial institutions from offering services related to cryptocurrency transactions in May 2021. Not just that, it also warned investors against speculative cryptocurrency trading, in what has been a major crackdown on crypto assets. As a result of this massive clampdown, many big cryptocurrency mining companies are moving out of the country with their systems — including computers that are the most crucial part of the mining process. Cheap electricity in China made it favourable for many companies to undertake cryptocurrency operations on a large scale.

The expensive cryptocurrency mining machines are prone to damage if shaken. It can cost up to $12,000 (roughly Rs. 8.76 lakhs) per system. And the companies are now having to compute transportation costs and decide whether to send these machines by air or sea, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-listed company, has reportedly moved more than 20,000 computers out of China.

Samir V. Tabar, Bit Digital's Chief Strategy Officer, was quoted by the report saying that Bit Digital had hired large international logistics companies to help them move their machines. He hopes to get the computers in North America by September-end.

Fred Thiel, Chief Executive Officer at Marathon Digital Holdings, a Las Vegas-based cryptocurrency mining company, was quoted by the US daily saying that the Chinese crackdown has had a pretty big financial impact on the miners, who operated from there. “It's kind of like GM having to shut down a plant and build a new one elsewhere,"" he reportedly said.

Cheap electricity, especially in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang as well as Sichuan and Yunnan in China, despite its longstanding position against speculative crypto trading, made these preferred destinations for mining companies. Interestingly, Bit Digital, anticipating a clampdown, is said to have started moving its systems out of China in 2020 itself, but many others were caught off-guard.

Alejandro De La Torre, Vice President of Poolin, a cryptocurrency mining pool that operated in China, reportedly said that a crackdown on mining was always in the back of their minds but was never a pressing issue until the country initiated it. The report says the exodus of mining companies from China is also being referred to as the “great mining migration” by many.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_profund_bloomberg_1627542936069.jpg',)",none
2021-09-06,FXStreet,NFTs boost Ethereum,https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/nfts-boost-ethereum-202109061018,"Bitcoin may be a point of reference when it comes to cryptocurrencies. It holds 41% of the total capitalization of cryptocurrencies that has now reached 2.3 trillion as Bitcoin value is very close to one trillion dollars. But Bitcoin is not alone. The second-largest cryptocurrency based on capitalization, Ethereum (ETH) has approached 460 billion dollars or 20% of the total value of the cryptocurrency market as has made significant gains since last July where its price has risen significantly, close to 100%.

Looking at the reasons for the significant increase in the price of Ethereum, it seems that the growing demand for NFTs may play a key role in this increase. NFTs are the acronym for Non-fungible tokens. These are unique, irreplaceable, rare, easily identifiable digital objects protected by cryptography, with digital representations of real-world objects such as art, music, objects, and video game. They are bought and sold online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encrypted with the same underlying software as cryptocurrencies. The idea with NFTs is that each is a unique, irreplaceable, or rare asset, thus highlighting the concept of a rarity in the digital world.

NFTs are not located on a computer or server. They are kept at the owner's personal blockchain address, which is controlled with a private key. NFTs which are based on Ethereum, and the OpenSea platform have recorded a huge increase in demand, as the value of trading volume exceeded $ 3 billion in August.

This seems not to happen by accident. NFTs have already impacted digital art by unlocking a direct revenue-generating mechanism for creators. Artists can not only publish digital representations of their work but can directly sell their creations in global art markets. The OpenSea marketplace has the most, but there are also specialized parts, e.g., for a specific art form.

The NFTs' turnover has skyrocketed this year as NFTs are becoming a tool for publishing, monitoring, and monetizing, from almost any creative endeavor since NFTs are the decentralized, digital version of certifying the authenticity of a physical object. A property rights digitization mechanism that identifies an object or property title. Ultimately, it is an entire ecosystem of digital representation and asset ownership.

All these are suggesting that NFTs may still be far from seeing their full potential. NFTs are then likely to be used to represent the vast majority of the content that can be viewed, collected, or monetized on the Internet. It can be applied from music or digital concert tickets to real estate stocks and insurance policies. It can literally be applied to everything, in a parallel economic universe, outside the traditional financial system.

The NFT space is still in its infancy and may be hiding amazing opportunities as NFTs may play an important role in the future of commerce. The applications seem to be endless. One can borrow an expensive item that generates value if used, and share the profits with the owner, or buy digital land and rent it to someone else. It is, therefore, possible that in the new digital world that has already been created, cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, which is involved in this new world, might be boosted further by NFTs.","('https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Digital Currencies/Ethereum/ethereum_4_Large.jpg',)",none
2021-09-06,HT Tech,Token of Ethereum Rival Solana Jumps to Seventh in Crypto Top 10,https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/token-of-ethereum-rival-solana-jumps-to-seventh-in-crypto-top-10-71630923172048.html,"The cryptocurrency linked to the Solana network has jumped to seventh spot among the world’s top 10 largest virtual coins amid optimism that the blockchain could be a long term competitor to Ethereum.

Solana’s SOL token has tripled in about three weeks and now has a market value of more than $41 billion, according to CoinGecko. Proponents tout the claimed speed and lower cost of transactions on Solana for decentralized finance and digital collectibles, applications where Ethereum dominates.

“Solana has a growing ecosystem, projects are being built on it and it’s benefited hugely from the mania that’s taking place in NFTs,” Antoni Trenchev, co-founder at crypto lender Nexo, wrote in an email. NFTs are non-fungible tokens used to trade digital collectibles. He said the backing of crypto figure Sam Bankman-Fried -- chief executive of crypto exchange FTX -- is helping.

Solana bills itself as the world’s fastest blockchain and its website says the average cost per transaction is $0.00025. In June it announced that it had raised $314 million in a funding round with investors including Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital and CoinShares.

Late last month, Jump Trading-affiliated crypto market data provider Pyth Network went live on Solana’s mainnet, a development that’s expected to help bolster the world of decentralized finance. There are plans for it soon to be able to broadcast market data through the so-called Wormhole Network.

“It’s becoming too big to ignore and offers a different smart contract solution to Ethereum,” Jonathan Cheesman, head of over-the-counter and institutional sales at FTX, wrote in an email.

So-called alternative coins like Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA and Binance Coin have surged in recent weeks, taking some of the limelight from top tokens Bitcoin and Ether in a broad crypto revival from a May rout. Bitcoin has also rallied and came close to $52,000 on Monday.

Skeptics argue the technological upgrades propelling some tokens may not justify the scale of the rallies.","('https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2021/09/06/1600x900/2020-11-23T140031Z_977600602_RC229K9GLVG6_RTRMADP_3_CRYPTO-CURRENCIES_1607177306565_1607177319803_1630923214160.JPG',)",none

Bitcoin price prediction

Bitcoin price is back over $50,000 in three months, after a massive downfall in May 2021. While the price of one Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $51,600 (while compiling the report), Bitcoin saw its all-time high in the month of April 2021, when it crossed the threshold of $60,000. According to WalletInvestor.com, the Bitcoin price might rise as high as $80,248.90 by the end of this year and up to $1,94,134 in about five years. Do keep in mind that it is extremely difficult to predict the long term pricing of a digital coin and the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile in nature.

Why is Bitcoin going up?

There are several factors that are causing a surge in Bitcoin prices. The hype around the digital currency on all forms of media is reaching potential investors every day. Secondly, the surge in price encourages a lot of investors to hold their coins, with expectations of squaring off with huge profits at the peak of rallies. Additionally, cryptocurrency is growing as a payment option, the most recent example of which is PayPal which will allow users to buy, sell and accept Bitcoin as a mode of payment. Along with a 24-hour trading volume of over $30 billion, Bitcoin remains to be the top cryptocurrency today.","('https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/f5v2ced7uz7ls8xp_1630919942.jpeg',)",none
2021-09-06,Bitcoin News,Sunacrip and Venezuelan Intelligence Police Issue Warning on Cryptocurrency Scams – Emerging Markets Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/sunacrip-and-venezuelan-intelligence-police-issue-warning-on-cryptocurrency-scams/,"Sunacrip and Venezuelan Intelligence Police Issue Warning on Cryptocurrency Scams

Sunacrip, the Venezuelan cryptocurrency watchdog, and the Intelligence Police (CICPC) issued a warning for the general population about cryptocurrency scams. The institutions gave a series of recommendations to avoid being scammed by cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes involving the national cryptocurrency, petro (PTR), advising users to always keep their accounts’ passwords secure. This is the government’s answer to a series of crypto scams that have been happening in the country in the last few days.

Venezuelan Regulator and Intelligence Police Warn Users

The cryptocurrency watchdog, Sunacrip, and the Venezuelan intelligence police have issued a warning on social media about general cyber security, advising users to take a series of basic steps to avoid being victims of crypto-related scams. The information was shared using the Instagram account of the information related crime division of the Intelligence police, where the institution stated:

We inform the community to avoid being victims of scams through the homeland system with false managers who only seek their own profit.

The homeland system is a platform development that serves as a way of getting petros (PTR), the national cryptocurrency, out of the internal wallet of the government and into Sunacrip approved exchanges, that allow users to sell their petros at market value. The intelligence police also suggested users move all of their crypto assets through Sunacrip-approved exchanges to guarantee their safety doing these transactions.

Big Crypto Scams

Sunacrip also suggested users handle their accounts by themselves and avoid giving their passwords to third parties managing accounts. This is likely the answer to a big cryptocurrency scam that happened last week, when a man allegedly faked his kidnappings and stole more than one million dollars from his customers.

According to reports of Douglas Rico, head of the intelligence police in Venezuela, Andrés Jesús Dos Santos Hernández simulated a kidnapping where his captors allegedly forced him to enter the Binance platform and make transfers to different digital wallets, exhausting all of the crypto assets from his customers.

Dos Santos is now on the run from national authorities, facing money laundering and fraud charges. Binance has become a hotbed of financial movements from Venezuelans that are investing in cryptocurrencies, and different individuals are offering their services as financial advisors and consultants, managing investments and accounts from their customers. Specifically, Binance’s P2P market has dethroned the former leader platform, Localbitcoins, relegating it to second place in trading volumes.

What is CBDC?

CBDC and the world

Do we need CBDC in India?

India’s Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of India is progressively moving towards launching its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). RBI will follow a “phased implementation strategy” to this end.RBI Deputy governor T Rabi Sankar is sure that CBDC will be a positive step in India, which is seeing a surge in cryptocurrency investments. The strategy by RBI also includes a pilot study to test CBDC as a general-purpose digital currency, which will perhaps be the first fiat digital currency in the world. Presently, countries that have opened their economies for cryptocurrencies include El Salvador and Cuba.The idea of CBDC is not a new development. It was James Tobin, an American Nobel laureate and economist, who suggested in the 1980s that US Federal Reserve Banks could make available to the public a widely accessible medium of transactions, according to the keynote address delivered by T Rabi Shankar in July this year.Except currency notes, all fiat money (currency notes and coins) or representative money (cheques, drafts, securities, and bonds) can be treated as CBDC. Many of them are now just electronic transfers and documents, which are in fact fit to be CDBC. Many central banks in the world are now closer to having their own digital version of their fiat money.“A CBDC is legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form. It is the same as fiat currency and is exchangeable one-to-one with fiat currency. Only its form is different,” the keynote address says.RBI specifies that a CBDC is a digital or virtual currency but it can’t be compared to private virtual currencies that have emerged over the last few years. The idea of private virtual currencies is at odds with the historical concept of money.RBI agrees that the CBDC is currently on top of the minds of many central banks of countries across the globe. Many of them have reached the stage where a pilot project has been launched and in some other countries Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) have been put in place.RBI has a ready reckoner in the case of Sweden which has popularised an electronic form of currency of its own and works like fiat money. But the pilot project which the RBI has launched may well have to go beyond the financial aspect but also take into consideration certain social aspects.One of the yardsticks that RBI may employ to gauge the need of CBDC is the electronic interface receipts and payments. India is currently leading the world in terms of digital payments innovations. Its payment systems are available 24X7, available to both retail and wholesale customers, they are largely real-time, and the cost of transaction is probably the lowest in the world.It is very likely for the RBI to issue its own CBDC soon as there is a roaring influx of private virtual currencies rushing into the fray of public payments and exchange for goods and services. Many multinationals operating from India in both retail and wholesale accept private virtual currencies as a payment interface.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85972423,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-80970,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Most Europeans support locally issued laws instead of set rules imposed by the European Union.



51 percent citizens from Greece,47 percent citizens from Italy,46 percent from Estonia, 41 percent from Netherlands,40 percent from Germany, 39 percent from Latvia and 37 percent from France preferred their own government to regulate their respective cryptocurrencies.



Majority of citizens surprisingly preferred the issuance of local cryptocurrency in lieu of a digital euro, showing that most Europeans find the European Union integration economically inefficient.



However, Eurozone countries, 41 percent Italian, 40 percent Greeks, 39 percent Estonians and 37 percent Spaniards favoured the initiative of having a common digital euro.



According to a recent poll study conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, a global consulting firm, Europeans are against the EU-imposed cryptocurrency restrictions on its member states, as stated in a Bitcoin.com report.The survey polled above 31,000 citizens in 12 member states in the European Union (EU), namely Germany, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Portugal. Most of the citizens surveyed in favour of an independent cryptocurrency regulation in each country compared to the total 25 percent that approved EU imposed regulation. These surveyed people however admitted that they have insufficient knowledge about cryptocurrency, pointing to the fact that despite the recent crypto boom, there was a great need for people to get better informed about the crypto phenomenon.The survey came up with the following findings :Dimitar Lilkov, Research Officer at Wilfried Martens Center for European Studies in Brussels said that Eurozone countries wanting to make use of a digital currency would be linked to a potential digital euro, led by the European Central Bank (ECB) in coordination with the eurozone banking system as per the Bitcoin.com report. On the other hand, any country that would issue its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would have to exit the EU to be able to do so, as digital euro is likely to come in future, Lilkov added.According to the survey, lack of knowledge about cryptocurrencies seems to be the main reason behind the reluctance of Europeans in purchasing crypto assets.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85972341,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-95106,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Twitter is working to add Bitcoin transactions for its ‘Tip Jar’ which enables content creators to monetize their content.

Twitter’s product lead Kayvon Beykpour confirmed the development after a user called Alessandro Paluzzi posted a screenshot showing how the users will be allowed to receive tips through Bitcoin. While Beykpour didn’t elaborate on the subject, Paluzzi’s screenshot signals that Twitter is considering The Lightning Network, a payment transfer technology for tips in Bitcoin.

The microblogging platforms rolled out the tip jar feature in May through a number of payment gateways like Bandcamp, Patreon, PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App. It has also added an Indian payment gateway Razorpay for the same.

To send someone money, simply go to the person’s profile, click on the tip jar icon, select from the available modes of payment and complete your payment. Twitter has also made it clear that the company takes no cut from the amount you send or receive.

While Tip Jar appears as an icon on iOS and Android, the feature is also accessible within Spaces on Android only.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has time and again displayed his enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies. He had hailed Bitcoin saying it changes everything for the better while retweeting CFO of Square Amrita Ahuja's post reiterating the company's Bitcoin strategy.

Dorsey in February had put out the word that he and rap mogul Jay-Z were creating a fund devoted to making bitcoin digital money ""the internet's currency."" Dorsey, who is also the founder and chief of financial services and mobile payments firm Square, said in a tweet that he and Jay-Z are giving 500 bitcoin to fund an independent endowment called ""Btrust.""

Bitcoin on Monday jumped over $51,000 taking the market capitalization over $975 billion.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2020/05/bitcoincrytocurrency-770x433.jpg',)",none
2021-09-06,Finance Magnates,Thai Regulator to Revoke Local Crypto Exchange License of Huobi,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/thai-regulator-to-revoke-local-crypto-exchange-license-of-huobi/,"Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recommended the country’s Finance Ministry to revoke the digital asset exchange license of Huobi (Thailand) Co, which is accused of failing to fix system flaws.

Announced on Saturday, the financial regulator is pushing the exchange to suspend its services and return clients’ funds within the next three months.

The decision did not come as a surprise as the SEC had multiple meetings with Huobi representatives, pointing out the flaws on the exchanges. In reviews conducted last February and March, the regulator found flaws in the exchange’s management structure and platform, which violated the local regulations.

One of the Few Thai Crypto Exchanges

Huobi (Thailand) is the Thai affiliate of the global crypto exchange, Huobi. The Thai unit gained the mandatory license in July 2019, becoming one of the few crypto exchanges to operate in the country.

The latest announcement detailed that the SEC had already asked Huobi to fix the flaws on the Thai exchange in a meeting held on March 19. In a consecutive meeting in April, the financial market regulator asked the exchange to suspend its services and return clients’ funds, until the issues were not rectified within a set deadline. However, Huobi kept asking for an extension of the deadline.

The latest recommendation to revoke Huobi’s license came after the exchange failed to rectify the critical flaws even after five months of the initial warning.

The Thai SEC is becoming very strict in regulating the local crypto exchanges. As the global regulators started to issue warnings against Binance, the Thai regulator went a step further and lodged a criminal complaint against the exchange.

Meanwhile, the Spanish securities markets regulator issued a warning against 10 companies last month that include the names of two popular global crypto exchanges, Huobi and Bybit.","('https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Untitled-design-2.jpg',)",none

“Chainlink’s market value is up 119% in the past six weeks and gained another 12% in the past 24 hours. The rate of notable GitHub submissions from the LINK developers has been undeniably rising rapidly over time,” Santiment highlighted.

Chainlink started 2021 at a price of approximately $11. The cryptocurrency gained popularity among retail and institutional investors during the first five months of 2021 as the price touched an all-time high of nearly $52 on 10 May.

Amidst the rising decentralized finance and non-fungible token activity surge, Solana hit an all-time high of $149.91 earlier this week.

Analysts expect the altcoin to sustain its price rally and compete with Ethereum for DeFi market share.

FTX exchange shares the first glimpse of a next-generation non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace that supports cross-chain selling.

Sam Bankman-Fried announces the launch of a cross-chain NFT marketplace on FTX US

Ethereum rival Solana’s recent price rally has garnered attention from several traders and analysts. The altcoin has posted 51% gains in the past week. Analysts expect SOL’s current price rally to be a prolonged one.

The spike in NFT activity on Solanart, the marketplace built on the SOL blockchain, was instrumental in driving the altcoin’s price higher. The fastest blockchain network in the world, Solana is capable of processing 50,000 transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of Ethereum’s transaction fees.

FTX team, led by founder and CEO Sam-Bankman Fried, is working on Serum, a project that creates a fully permissionless Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and DeFi ecosystem with trustless cross-chain trading. Serum is powered by the Solana blockchain that offers higher speed and throughput compared to Ethereum.

Sam-Bankman Fried has announced FTX’s latest offering, an NFT marketplace that enables cross-chain selling between Ethereum and Solana. SOL’s NFT market share is increasing consistently as creators prefer the technologically superior and low-cost network.

All NFTs will be cross-chain ETH/SOL!



Deposits/withdrawals opening up in the next couple weeks.



You'll also be able to deposit outside NFTs then! — SBF (@SBF_FTX) September 6, 2021

The FTX US website currently features a testing interface where Fried has listed his test NFT for sale. According to the crypto billionaire, creators can make their own NFTs, list them for trade on FTX’s platform, and the exchange plans to open deposits and withdrawals within the next couple of weeks.

Interestingly, traders have the option to deposit “outside NFTs,” digital art, and collectibles that they have purchased on other platforms like peer-to-peer marketplace OpenSea or Solanart. This is an exciting feature for NFT traders, given that the ecosystem is currently plagued by low liquidity.

Overall, this development is expected to have a bullish impact on Solana’s price in the following weeks. Pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst @SmartContracter has predicted that Solana is likely to hit another all-time high.","('https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Others/pagina cryptos_Large.png',)",none

How are GPU prices linked to cryptocurrency prices?

After cooling down for a few weeks, GPU prices are surging once again much to the annoyance of gamers. The recent breakout in Ethereum prices has led to an increase in GPU prices by nearly 20%, according to various trackers.A report by MyDrivers , a Chinese news portal that tracks tech-related supply chain news, has revealed that Nvidia GPU (graphics processing unit) prices are up by 18% in China. The report states that the supply of Nvidia graphics cards will be “very tight” in September, with total units expected to be down by 50%.While GPU prices bottomed out around July, the new spike could be a result of a major breakout in Ethereum prices. In the last one week, Ethereum has surged by over 23%, going from $3,172 (approx. ₹2,31,700) to $3,912 (approx. ₹2,85,700).Ethereum was trading around $2,000 in July, leading to a decline in GPU prices across the board, as cryptocurrency mining became less profitable. At $2,000 levels, Ethereum’s price had fallen by half from its previous highs of over $4,000.Unsurprisingly, with Ethereum back in the $4,000 range, GPU prices have picked up steam, too. And it’s not just Nvidia cards that have seen an increase in prices – the AMD RX 6000 series cards have witnessed a noticeable increase, too.This is at a time when the supply is still keeping up with the demand – according to a 3D Center report, supply has taken a minor hit despite the surge in demand. If and when the supply gets even more constrained, we could see a much more rapid increase in GPU prices.According to data compiled by MyDrivers, some of the worst affected graphics cards are Nvidia-based ones from Asus and Gigabyte. Note that these are prices in China.AsusGigabyteFor context, these are the current prices of some of these graphics cards in India:Source: Cost to Cost, Prime ABGB 3D Center report notes that GPU prices are increasing in Europe as well.If the Ethereum rally continues and with supply issues expected to worsen in the coming weeks, you can expect GPU prices to increase even more from where they are now.Cryptocurrency mining requires a GPU or a dedicated application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to solve complex mathematical problems.Cryptocurrency mining can be an expensive proposition given the hardware it requires, and the power that is consumed in the process. If cryptocurrency prices increase, crypto mining becomes more profitable, thereby resulting in an increase in demand for GPUs.With Ethereum prices nearly doubling over the last one week, it’s no surprise that GPU prices are increasing once again.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/85968902/bad-news-for-gamers-gpu-prices-are-increasing-once-again-this-time-because-of-ethereum.jpg?imgsize=44246',)",none

Photo by Reuters

After Bitcoin prices increased, cryptocurrency mining has returned with a vengeance, with many buying rigs to mine Bitcoin, Ethereum and others.

Quang Thuan, owner of a chain of shops in HCMC that sell cryptocurrency mining rigs, simplified computers made from graphics processing units or application-specific integrated circuits, said sales have tripled in early September from last month.

A few months ago the mining rig market was gloomy because prices of cryptocurrencies decreased, but Bitcoin moved back up to $50,000 in the second half of August, he said.

On July 20, the world's largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 5 percent to $29,300, its lowest since June 22, according to Reuters. Smaller cryptocurrencies such as ether and XRP , which tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, also lost around 5 percent.

Le Hung, administrator of a cryptocurrency mining group with nearly 80,000 members, said the mining market has heated up due to two key factors.

""First, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have simultaneously seen price hikes, and miners have started to make profits. Second, the pandemic (Covid-19) has prolonged, reducing investment options, and so more people have opted for coin mining.""

Ngoc Van of the southern province of Dong Nai, who has established an Ethereum mine, said: ""It cost me nearly VND3 billion ($130,400) to set up this mine. All rigs are new and stable. I hope I can recoup the investment in six months.""

Miners can buy graphics processing units and assemble the rigs by themselves, or buy completely-built ones. Chinese mining rigs are also available in the Vietnamese market.

The owner of a shop in HCMC’s District 10 said: ""On average, a rig is sold for VND30 million.""

The best-sellers are equipment assembled with graphics processing units produced by AMD or Nvidia. Their prices are VND80-100 million now, some VND5 million higher than in mid-August, Van said.

According to rig suppliers, mining markets have gone up and down in line with cryptocurrency prices.

""Now people go to specialized shops to buy rigs for billions of dong,"" said Hoang Tuan, owner of a chain of computer shops in HCMC.

Data from Statista in February showed Vietnam had the second highest rate in terms of cryptocurrencyuse among 74 surveyed economies, driven by remittance payments.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not recognized as a legitimate means of payment in Vietnam.

But not everyone is convinced.

The price of bitcoin has surged ahead of El Salvador’s decision to turn the cryptocurrency into legal tender.

Over the weekend, the digital coin pushed above the $US51,000 ($A68,500) mark.

At time of writing, the world-leading cryptocurrency was selling for $US51,788.90 ($A69642.92) per coin, according to CoinMarketCap.

That’s not too far behind bitcoin’s all-time high on April 13 of $US63,314 (about $85,000).

The last time bitcoin was around $US51,000 ($A68,888) was in the middle of May.

It then fell to $US31,796 (around $42,000) on July 18, but over the last two months has been slowly rising.

The coin rose by 5.4 per cent in the last week and is now up 26.3 per cent in the last month.

Its spike in price has been credited to a number of factors including El Salvador and Facebook throwing its weight behind it.

On Tuesday, bitcoin will become legal tender in El Salvador, the first country in the world to do so.

That means that if someone wants to pay in bitcoin, retailers will have no choice but to accept it.

El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele is a huge bitcoin enthusiast. He has a pair of laser eyes on his Twitter profile at least – which indicates he is bullish about the digital coins.

In June, El Salvador voted to become the first nation in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.

With 62 out of 84 possible votes, politicians voted in favour of the move to create a law to adopt bitcoin for everyday use.

The bill will allow the famously volatile digital currency to be used for many aspects of daily life, from property purchases to tax contributions.

The law comes into effect on September 7.

Some think this will make more people buy into bitcoin.

To encourage citizens to jump on the bandwagon, the El Salvador government even haded out $30 in free bitcoins to anyone who signs up for its national digital wallet, known as Chivo.

And what’s even more radical, foreigners who invest three bitcoins into the country – currently a whopping $US150,000 ($A200,000) – will be granted residency, according to Fast Company.

However, not everyone is a fan of the move.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is worried about the coin’s volatility and has warned that it could destabilise the El Salvador economy.

Over the weekend, citizens protested against the change, citing fears of economic instability.

FACEBOOK EMBRACES CRYPTO

To top off the excitement surrounding bitcoin and crypto in general, tech giant Facebook has waded in, further buoying the market.

Last week, Facebook executive David Marcus told Bloomberg that the social media platform was creating its own digital wallet to facilitate non-fungible token (NFT) transactions.

While this doesn’t directly affect bitcoin, it still adds to the cryptocurrency hype.

Bitcoin’s biggest rival, ethereum, does use NFTs and the announcement also sent its price skyrocketing.

Over the weekend, it soared to nearly $US4000 ($A5400).

At time of writing, the second most valuable crypto was selling for $US3,926.63 ($A5280.57) per coin.

Facebook has fully bought into the cryptocurrency market as it is working on its own coin, which will be known as “diem”.

The plan is to launch diem and the digital wallet at the same time to encourage usage.

2021-09-06,NDTV Gadgets 360,Binance Removes Singapore Products From Main Platform After Regulator's Warning,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/binance-singapore-ban-cryptocurrency-services-restriction-app-remove-september-10-central-bank-changpeng-zhao-2531097,"Embattled Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said it will restrict its services in Singapore days after the city state's central bank said it should stop offering payment services.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore became the latest regulator to take aim at Binance, warning last week that its global platform, Binance.com, could be breaking the law by providing payment services to Singapore residents without an appropriate licence.

Binance.com will stop offering Singapore dollar payment options and Singapore dollar trading pairs from September 10 and the app will be removed from the Singapore iOS and Google Play stores, it said in a post on its website.

The restrictions only apply to Binance's global platform and not its Singapore platform, which Changpeng Zhao, the company's chief executive has urged users to switch to.

Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, which previously could serve almost all markets in the world via one platform, are now increasingly running into resistance from local regulators.

In recent months, regulators in Britain, Italy, and Hong Kong have said Binance units are not authorised to carry out some activities in their markets, while Malaysia's financial regulator reprimanded the exchange for operating illegally in the country. Bloomberg also reported earlier this year that Binance was under investigation by the US Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service.

2021-09-06,Goodreturns,"Bitcoin Nears $52,000; Up 81% From This Year's Low",https://www.goodreturns.in/news/bitcoin-nears-52-000-up-81-from-this-year-s-low-1222433.html,"Bitcoin Nears $52,000; Up 81% From This Year's Low Business oi-Sneha Kulkarni

On September 6, cryptocurrency prices are still rising. The worldwide cryptocurrency market capitalization is $2.34 trillion, up 2.79 percent from the previous day, while total crypto market volume is $118.20 billion, down 6.37 percent in the last 24 hours.

Over press time, Bitcoin was trading at $51,707, up about 3.16% over the previous week. Last week, higher price movements in cryptocurrencies have coincided with a rebound in global stocks, indicating that investors have a stronger appetite for risk.

The world's largest and most well-known cryptocurrency is up 81 percent from its low of $27,734 on January 4 of this year.

For the first time since May, Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surpassed $4,000 on Friday. Now it is trading at $3,923 at press time. Over the last week, ETH has gained roughly 20%, continuing its outperformance over bitcoin.

After surviving a more than 50% fall during the summer, Bloomberg's Crypto Outlook named $100,000 BTC and $5,000 Ether (ETH) the ""route of least resistance.""

According to one statistic, Bitcoin (BTC) should cost at least $55,000 per coin due to its so-called ""supply shock.""

Analyst Willy Woo highlighted what he described as a ""conservative"" price projection for BTC/USD in a tweet on September 5.

Investing in cryptocurrency is still a high-risk proposition. If you want to invest at all, you should only invest what you can afford to lose.

The world's first successful decentralized cryptocurrency and payment system, Bitcoin, was founded in 2009. Cryptography - a scientific method of encoding and decoding data - is used to secure and verify transactions in a group of digital assets known as bitcoin. Those transactions are frequently stored on computers all around the world using blockchain, a distributed ledger technology.

The amount of Ethereum destroyed by EIP-1559, a recently implemented upgrade that burns transaction fees that were previously paid to miners, has topped 200,000 ETH (about $675 million at current rates).

Late this year or early in 2022, Ethereum's blockchain will ""merge"" with the proof-of-stake version. Ethereum 2.0 will, however, take a few years to catch up to Ethereum 1.0 in terms of smart contract capability.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking into the developer of the decentralized exchange Uniswap.

According to the source, the SEC is interested in learning more about how investors use the exchange and how it is advertised.","('https://www.goodreturns.in/img/2018/01/bitcoingain-4-08-1512731940-14-1515885141.jpg',)",none

The feature is reportedly in development and was spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who shared screenshots of what this will look like when it launches. Later, Twitter’s head of product Kayvon Beykpour retweeted Paluzzi’s tweet with the message ‘soon’ indicating that this is indeed in the works.

According to Paluzzi’s screenshot, Twitter’s Tip Jar will use the Lightning Network to let users collect their Bitcoin payments. Another screenshot shows that users will be able to collect tips in both Bitcoin and Ethereum and the platform will let them add their respective addresses for these to their profile.

The screenshot also shows that Twitter is using Strike for Bitcoin payments. Strike is a payments application, which uses Bitcoin and blockchain technology for payments globally. It can also be used to buy and sell Bitcoin.

The Tip Jar feature was added back in May by Twitter. At the time, Twitter had said that the feature will be made available to a limited number of users and that they will be able to add it to their profile. At the moment only, select creators, journalists, experts, and nonprofits will see the Tip Jar on their profile. Twitter had said it will expand the feature to more users later on.

Check out the tweet below

#Twitter is working on the ability to receive tips in #Bitcoin 👀 pic.twitter.com/uycD3qsR5F — Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) September 1, 2021

Twitter’s cryptocurrency addition will be the latest in a series of moves designed to help creators on the platform find a source of income. It also signals the growing importance of cryptocurrency as a means of payment. Bitcoin has once again crossed $50,000 mark, while Ethereum is also rising at $3900 and is gaining acceptance as a means of payment.

In June, Twitter had added RazorPay as the first Indian payment gateway to the Tip Jar, which would allow users in India to also collect tips on the platform. Twitter had also announced that the Tip Jar feature would be made available in multiple Indian languages including Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi and Tamil.

Once a Tip Jar is set up a profile, followers of the user can support them by sending tips. And given the RazorPay support, they have the option of sending money via multiple modes of payment including UPI, credit and debit cards, net banking, wallets, etc.","('https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/09/TipJar1_LEAD1.jpg',)",none

Total market capitalization

Bitcoin price

After a successful close above USD 50,000, bitcoin price gained bullish momentum. BTC broke many hurdles near USD 51,000 and USD 51,200. It even traded close to USD 52,000 before the bears appeared. It is now consolidating gains below the USD 52,000 resistance. If there is an upside break above USD 52,000, the price could rise towards the USD 53,000 level.

On the downside, the price could find support near the USD 51,200 level. The main support is now forming near the USD 50,500 level.

Ethereum price

Ethereum price made another attempt to clear the USD 4,000 resistance, but it failed. As a result, ETH corrected lower below USD 3,950. However, the bulls were active near the USD 3,850 level. The price is now consolidating above USD 3,900, with many hurdles near USD 3,980 and USD 4,000.

If there is another downside correction, the price could find support near USD 3,850. The next major support is near the USD 3,800 level.

ADA, LTC, DOGE, and XRP price

Cardano (ADA) failed to stay above USD 3.00 and corrected lower. However, downsides were limited below USD 2.85. The price is now stuck in a range below the USD 3.00 resistance. A close above USD 3.00 could start a stronger increase.

Litecoin (LTC) broke many hurdles near USD 200 and USD 212. LTC even cleared USD 220 and it is now consolidating gains. An immediate resistance is near the USD 230 level. A clear break above USD 230 and USD 232 could open the doors for a move towards the USD 250 level.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 4% and it broke the USD 0.312 resistance. The next major resistance is near the USD 0.320 level. Any more gains might lead the price towards the USD 0.335 level. If not, there might be a downside correction towards the USD 0.300 level.

XRP price gained pace above the USD 1.30 resistance. It is up over 6% and it even cleared the USD 1.32 resistance. There was a spike towards the USD 1.34 level, where the bulls faced resistance. XRP is now consolidating around USD 1.32, with support near USD 0.305 and USD 0.300.

Other altcoins market today

Many altcoins are up over 5%, including QNT, FTM, FIL, OMG, LINK, LUNA, QTUM, AMP, HT, ICP, ALGO, ATOM, CRO, EOS, and COMP. Out of these, QNT rallied over 41% and it surpassed the USD 335 level.

Overall, bitcoin price settled well above the USD 50,000 resistance zone. If BTC continues to rise and clears USD 52,000, there could be a move towards USD 53,000 or USD 53,500.

Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone has affirmed his bitcoin price prediction of $100K, seeing $5K for ethereum as the path of least resistance. He expects the crypto market to thrive in a “refreshed bull market.”

Cryptocurrencies Poised to Thrive, Bull Market Revived

Commodity strategist Mike McGlone discussed his price predictions for bitcoin and ethereum in the September edition of Bloomberg Crypto Outlook, published Friday.

“Crypto-assets appear in a revived and refreshed bull market with the 2H benefit of a steep discount from previous highs at the start,” he began, adding:

We see ethereum on course toward $5,000 and $100,000 for bitcoin. Portfolios of some combination of gold and bonds appear increasingly naked without some bitcoin and ethereum joining the mix.

The analyst explained that “diminishing supply” is boosting the price of ETH amid “increasing demand and adoption,” emphasizing that ethereum is the primary denominator for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) “which are gaining traction.”

He discussed “the accelerating downward trajectory of new ethereum supply, in the aftermath of the protocol change that began burning coins at the start of August.” McGlone clarified, “For the first time, the 52-week rate-of-change in the amount of new ethereum coins vs. the total outstanding is on track to drop below 4%.”

The Bloomberg Intelligence analyst proceeded to describe that bitcoin reaching $100,000 is “highly probable, especially after last year’s supply cut.” He continued: “Post-halving years have seen the greatest appreciation, and 4x in 2021 would be quite tame for the No. 1 crypto compared with 55x in 2013 and 15x in 2017.”

Emphasizing that “the bulls are in control,” the analyst asserted that “Having survived correction, crypto assets [are] now poised to thrive.” He elaborated:

After enduring a gut-wrenching correction, we see the crypto market more likely to resume its upward trajectory than drop below the 2Q lows.

Some altcoins, however, started to decline owing to longer periods of trading sideways. For instance, DOT moved nearer to the price floor of $$28.94.

Chainlink, too flashed range-restricted price action and was trading close to an immediate support level of $30.37 with chances of falling near its one-week low price level at $24.30.

Ethereum (ETH)

ETH/USD, TradingViewEthereum’s price action has been consolidating with minor gains of 0.9% over the last 24 hours. It was priced at $3933.29. It toppled over its price ceiling of $3855.11, and a break from the consolidation could push Ethereum to revisit the multi-month high of $4033.47.

Technical indicators, however, pointed that bearish price movement hadn’t fizzled out completely yet. Relative Strength Index was positioned above the 60-mark as buying strength remained bullish. MACD flashed red bars on its histogram.

Awesome Oscillator flashed red signal bars indicating negative price action. If the bearish perspective holds true, Ethereum would dip below $3855.11 and trade near $3387.08. Failing to remain above the $3387.08 price level would push ETH to its one week low of $2946.43.

In other news, Twitter could possibly allow Bitcoin and Ethereum to enable receiving tips through Tip Jar feature.

Polkadot (DOT)

DOT traded in a range-bound manner and dipped by 0.8%. It was trading at $32.70. The altcoin stood notches below its weekly high of $33.37. If DOT’s price action remains consolidated over upcoming trading sessions, chances are that the altcoin could dip to $28.94.

Failing to sustain at $28.94, could drop DOT to a four week low of $25.22. The technical indicators appeared bearish for the coin. MACD underwent a bearish crossover and displayed red bars on its histogram.

Awesome Oscillator flashed red signal bars. Capital inflows dipped as the Chaikin Money Flow parked below the mid-line. If DOT reversed its price action on the upside, the overhead resistance was at $33.37, toppling it, DOT could aim for $34.41.

Chainlink (LINK)

LINK fell by 0.2% while consolidating over the last 24 hours. The asset was priced at $30.54 and with a continued downtrend, LINK might fall to $30.37 and then to $27.77. If LINK is unable to hold its prices above $27.77, it might trade near its weekly low of $24.30.

Key indicators signified a negative price action. MACD displayed red bars on its histogram. Awesome Oscillator also flashed red signal bars.

Bollinger Bands remained tight, which means that price volatility would remain low over upcoming trading sessions. On the reverse side, LINK could find resistance at its three-month high of $31.22 and the attempt to retest the $32.22 price level.

With regards to recent developments, Bored Ape Yacht Club initiated an adoption with Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to provide airdrops on the platform. This integration could lead to the increased interest of investors.

The next session is at least two months away.But crypto exchanges have used the interim period to launch a massive lobbying initiative with several governments and regulatory agencies, raising concerns. The exchanges have argued that a ban on digital currency transactions will result in job losses.While there are fears that a ban will lead to investors getting locked into the instrument, sources indicated that a three-six month window will be provided for investors to exit.Several officials have junked the argument that crypto currencies are an asset class. Besides, there are worries over the legal basis for the presence of some of the exchanges, which remain outside the jurisdiction of either Sebi or the RBI. “There has to be global coordination to combat the challenge posed by cryptocurrencies. They are not a currency as only the sovereign can issue currency. There is a grave danger in allowing these instruments,” said a source.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85964230,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-105112,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

A software developer Guido Vraken announced on August 18th that he had discovered the bug. Guido Vraken is a scientist who specializes in discovering open-source software code vulnerabilities.

He is also interested in scientific works, product development and validation, regulatory matters, and teaching. Guido Vraken is a graduate of the University of Ghent and a volunteer at Natuurpunt.

As stated earlier in the GitHub security advisory post, Geth’s vulnerability can make a node unable to execute Ethereum blocks.

The Ethereum experienced a temporary split on its chain during the last Geth code’s fix for a software bug. The split resulted from communication lapses from Geth developers regarding the bug, which was a deliberate act.

However, several computers known as ‘nodes’ don’t bother to customize their Geth users to the normal implementation. This led to a consensus failure in the blockchain, as recorded in November 2020.

Geth Developers Take On The Latest Version

In a blog post, the Geth developer team mentioned that not exposing the security vulnerability is backed by some reasons. First, the act delays all potential attacks on intending node operators that require more time to migrate to the newest version.

Now, Geth developers emphasize how urgent it is for all their software users to migrate to the latest version. However, their formal August 18th announcement didn’t explicitly describe the vulnerability nature and form.

One of the Geth developers, Péter Szilágyi, stated his opinion while tweeting about the code release on Tuesday. He said that “People were not happy with our hotfix last time; they noted that we didn’t make the announcement. So we have decided to do it differently this time; let’s know the one that works better,” – he added.

Infura and other major Etherum-based wallets and services have pledged their support for this latest Geth release. They publicly made this announcement on Twitter.

2021-09-06,Benzinga,5 Things You Might Not Know About Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/09/22811912/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-ethereum-creator-vitalik-buterin,"One of the most well-known figures in the world of cryptocurrency is Vitalik Buterin. Known as the founder and creator of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Buterin also has experience with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).

Early Days: Buterin was born in Russia in 1994. His family emigrated to Canada when he was six years old.

Buterin excelled in school and was placed in an accelerated program for gifted students while in the third grade. Buterin naturally excelled in math and programming. It’s reported that Buterin could add three-digit numbers in his head twice as fast as kids his age at the time.

Worked At Bitcoin Magazines: In 2011, Buterin took a side job working for Bitcoin Weekly. As a writer, Buterin was paid 5 Bitcoin for each article written. At the time that made each article payment less than $5 for Buterin.

Bitcoin Magazine was founded by Buterin later in 2011 where he was the lead writer.

Creation of Ethereum: Buterin launched a white paper for Ethereum in late 2013. The goal of Ethereum was to add scripting to make it easier for application development. Buterin wanted to make it possible to set up binding contracts.

Ethereum was officially launched on July 30, 2015. Buterin currently holds 333,500 ETH in his primary wallet.

Today, the 333,500 Ethereum are worth $1.3 billion, making Buterin a billionaire.

Donated To Charity: As the founder of a popular cryptocurrency, Buterin has built a large following of people from the community.

As a result, Buterin is often the subject of donations from new cryptocurrencies that hope Buterin will support them or others will see the coins in his public wallet.

Buterin was donated 50 trillion Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB), worth around $1.2 billion at the time. Buterin donated the Shiba Inu to the India Covid Relief Fund along with $2 million worth of Ethereum. The announcement that Buterin was donating the Shiba Inu instead of keeping it led to a crash in the price of the cryptocurrency.

Fake Death Rumor: In 2017, it was reported that Buterin died in a car crash. The rumor came from 4Chan, a popular board to share stories and often the subject of internet trolls.

Ethereum lost around $4 billion in value on the internet rumor. Ethereum’s price recovered, but the impact on the price from news of his death offered up a look at how important Buterin could be to Etehreum’s success.

The drop in Ethereum’s price also led to a comparison of Bitcoin’s founder being anonymous and Ethereum having a public founder.","('https://cdn2.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/ethereum2.jpg?width=720',)",none

At the time of writing, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (defi) is around $176 billion across various blockchains like Ethereum, Binance, Terra, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche. While Ethereum commands $130 billion of the aggregate total locked, a myriad of other defi-fueled blockchains continue to see TVLs steadily rise.

Total Value Locked Across All Defi Compatible Blockchains

The total value locked (TVL) in defi today has risen to $176.9 billion with a change of 1.07% during the last 24 hours, according to defillama.com statistics. The TVL has been steadily nearing the $200 billion zone and today Uniswap commands 3% dominance among the variety of defi applications. The defi application Aave commands $16.04 billion and Curve captures $13.92 billion today as most of the TVL is locked into application bolstered by the Ethereum chain.

A number of other chains, however, have been contributing billions to the overall defi TVL. While Ethereum (ETH) has around $130.07 billion on Sunday, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has around $19.05 billion TVL. This is followed by Terra ($7.84B), Polygon ($5.34B), Solana ($4.3B), Avalanche ($2.36B) and Klaytn ($1.29B). The latest launch of the Arbitrum mainnet scaling solution for Ethereum has approximately $2,343,531 TVL on Sunday.

As far as decentralized exchange (dex) platforms are concerned, Curve has the most TVL today with $13.92 billion followed by the BSC-powered Pancakeswap with $5.94 billion and Uniswap has $5.3 billion TVL. For just the Ethereum chain alone, among 16 different dex platforms, Dune Analytics dex stats show there’s been $19 billion in global swaps during the last seven days. $2.24 billion in 24 hours and Uniswap commands 69.2% of all the dex volume across 16 dex platforms.

Uniswap Remains Ethereum’s Top Dex, Unique Defi Addresses Rise to 3.3 Million

Seven-day stats show Uniswap exchanged approximately $12,952,621,793 in global trades. 88% of the volume stems directly from dex applications but the rest of the volume (11.7%) are funneled through dex aggregators like 1inch, 0x API, Matcha, and Paraswap. The number of defi users or unique addresses across Ethereum-based defi apps is 3.3 million. The biggest lending apps today include platforms like Aave, Compound, Anchor, Venus, and Cream Finance respectively.

As far as yield-based TVL rankings on defillama.com are concerned, Convex Finance holds the top position on Sunday. This is followed by Yearn Finance, Alpaca Finance, Tranches, and Autofarm. The largest defi asset in terms of TVL is wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) with $10.05 billion locked. The second-largest defi asset is hbtc (HBTC) with $1.74 billion and mirror (MIR) with $1.01 billion.

2021-09-06,Cointelegraph,"Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, LTC, FIL, FTT, MIOTA",https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-ltc-fil-ftt-miota,"Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to sustain above $50,500 but that has not stopped the altcoins from following in Ether's (ETH) footsteps after the top-ranked altcoin hit $4,000 on Sept. 3. This has pushed Ether’s market dominance above 20% while Bitcoin’s dominance has shrunk to 41.1%.

However, Bitcoin’s hesitation in the past few days has not altered the outlook of Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone who has retained a $100,000 target on Bitcoin and $5,000 on Ether.

Apart from the top two cryptocurrencies, the nonfungible token (NFT) sector had been attracting investor’s attention since July. Cointelegraph contributor Jordan Finneseth recently suggested that the recent drop in transaction volumes and a few other reasons could be signaling a rotation of capital from NFTs to the decentralized finance sector.

Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the short term.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin broke above the $50,500 resistance on Sep. 3 to hit $51,000 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests a lack of buying at higher levels. That was followed by a Doji candlestick pattern on Sep. 4, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening but the upsloping moving averages indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If buyers drive the price above $51,000, the BTC/USDT pair could resume its uptrend. The first stop could be $55,000 but if this resistance is crossed, the up-move could reach $60,000.

Conversely, if the price turns down from the $50,500 to $51,000 resistance zone, the pair may drop to the 20-day exponential moving average ($47,998).

This is an important support for the bulls because if it cracks, the pair may remain range-bound between $46,200 and $50,500 for a few days. A break and close below $46,200 could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($43,291).

The price has been trading between the 20-EMA and the overhead zone. This tightening of the range is likely to result in a strong breakout soon. If buyers push the price above $51,000, the bullish momentum could pick, signaling the resumption of the uptrend.

Alternatively, if the price slides below the moving averages, it will suggest that bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance zone. That could pull the price down to $46,200. A bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound for some more time but a break below it will indicate that bulls may be losing their grip.

LTC/USDT

The bulls are attempting to push and sustain Litecoin (LTC) above the overhead resistance at $225.30. If they succeed, it will complete a rounding bottom pattern that may start a new uptrend.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The long wick on the Sep. 4 candlestick showed selling near the overhead resistance but the positive sign is that bulls did not cede much ground. They are again attempting to overcome the overhead hurdle.

If they can sustain the price above $225.30, the LTC/USDT pair could start an up-move to $300 and later to the pattern target at $347.30. The rising 20-day EMA ($184) and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.

This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

The 4-hour chart shows the bears tried to stall the up-move at the overhead resistance at $225.30 but the bulls did not give up much ground. This suggests that buyers continue to accumulate on any minor dip.

Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, indicating that bulls are in command. A break and close above $225.30 could open the doors for a rally to $250.40. Conversely, a break and close below the 20-EMA will be the first sign of weakness.

FIL/USDT

Filecoin’s FIL token has broken above the overhead resistance at $98 today. This completes a rounding bottom pattern, suggesting the start of a new uptrend. The bottoming formation has a pattern target at $156.

FIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($79) has turned up and the RSI has soared above 81, indicating a possible trend change. Usually, the breakout from a major pattern retests the breakout level. In this case, the price may drop to $98.

If bulls flip the $98 level into support, the FIL/USDT pair could resume its uptrend. On the contrary, if bears pull and sustain the price below $98, it will suggest that the recent breakout was a bull trap. The pair may then drop to the 20-day EMA.

If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls may once again try to propel the price above the overhead resistance and resume the uptrend. The bears will have to sink the price below the 20-day EMA to gain the upper hand.

The 4-hour chart shows a strong momentum in favor of buyers. That has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory, indicating the possibility of a minor correction or consolidation in the short term.

If bulls do not give up much ground, it will suggest that traders are not booking profits as they anticipate another leg higher. That will increase the likelihood of the resumption of the uptrend.

However, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below $98 and trap the aggressive bulls.

FTT/USDT

FTX Token (FTT) broke above the previous all-time high at $63.13 on Sep. 1 and followed it up with a new all-time high at $70.72 on Sep. 2. A new all-time high is a sign of strength but the bulls have not been able to sustain the price above the breakout level at $63.13.

FTT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

This suggests that bears have not yet given up and are attempting to stall the up-move. The negative divergence on the RSI suggests that the bullish momentum may be slowing down.

If bears pull the price below $57.93, the FTT/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($53). A strong bounce off this level will suggest that bulls are accumulating on dips. The buyers will then again attempt to push the price above the $63.13 to $70.72 resistance zone. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $84.

This positive view will invalidate if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the recent breakout above $63.13 was a bull trap.

The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close below $59. This bearish setup has a pattern target at $47.50. The flat 20-EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

If buyers drive and sustain the price above the downtrend line, it will invalidate the bearish pattern. The price may then rally to $65 and later to $70.72. A breakout and close above this level could start the next leg of the uptrend.

IOTA/USD

IOTA (MIOTA) rallied sharply from $0.96 on Sep. 1 to $2.08 on Sep. 4. This up-move pushed the RSI above 82, suggesting that the rally was overextended in the short term.

MIOTA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The MIOTA/USDT pair is currently witnessing profit-booking and it may drop to the first support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.64. A strong rebound off this level will suggest that traders are buying on minor dips.

The bulls will then make one more attempt to push the price above $2.08. If they succeed, the pair could pick up momentum and rally toward $2.40 and then $2.67.

Alternatively, if bears pull and sustain the price below $1.64, the next stop could be in the zone between the 50% retracement level at $1.51 and the 61.8% retracement level at $1.38. A deeper correction could delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.

The long wick on the 4-hour chart above the psychological barrier at $2 shows that bears are attempting to defend this level. Profit-booking may pull the price down to the 20-EMA, which is likely to act as a strong support.

If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA with strength, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and bulls are accumulating on dips. The buyers will then try to resume the uptrend by thrusting the price above $2.08.

A break and close below the 20-EMA will be the first sign of weakness. That may open the doors for a further decline to $1.50.

By Jason Pan / Staff reporter





Fourteen people have been arrested over a cryptocurrency investment scam that allegedly defrauded more than 100 people out of about NT$150 million (US$5.41 million) over the past year, police said on Friday.

The 14 suspects face charges of fraud, money laundering and breaches of the Organized Crime Prevention Act (組織犯罪防制條例), the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said.

A businessman surnamed Chen (陳) allegedly led the scheme, said CIB investigator Kuo Yu-chih (郭有志), who is in charge of the case.

Chen promoted cryptocurrency investment on social media and led the Taipei-based Azure Crypto Co, which offered cryptocurrency transactions, as well as other investment services, Kuo said.

Chen’s investment schemes focused on the cryptocurrencies ethereum, tronix and tether, Kuo said, adding that Chen promised high investment earnings through the blockchain technology.

“Chen and his staff set up Web sites, and allegedly used photographs of pretty women to attract mainly male victims, many of whom were in retirement with substantial savings,” he said.

The victims were drawn to the Web sites by the attractive images and persuaded to invest through interactions they believed to be with the women, while Chen and his staff presented themselves as financial advisers specializing in cryptomining, Kuo said.

Investigators confiscated ledgers listing more than 100 people caught up in the scam, the bureau said.

The person who lost the most had invested NT$29 million over two months, it said.

Investigators quoted the man as saying that after an initial investment, Azure Crypto promised him earnings that prompted him to invest more.

After complaints, the bureau monitored the firm’s activities and its online transactions over several months before conducting raids late last month at the company’s office, and the residences of Chen and his staff.","('https://www.taipeitimes.com/assets/images/TaipeiTimesLogo-1200X1200px_new.jpg',)",none
2021-09-05,GreekReporter.com,The Disastrous Environmental Impact of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency,https://greekreporter.com/2021/09/05/the-disastrous-environmental-impact-of-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency/,"While the benefits and disadvantages of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have long been debated, their impact on the environment has only just begun to be discussed.

Some argue that they are shady and untraceable, and others dismiss them as a bubble ready to burst, but despite criticisms, cryptocurrencies make up a significant portion of economic life today.

The widespread use of these digital currencies has urged researchers to look into the potential environmental impact of cryptocurrency.

Although it may seem that a digital coin, stored in a virtual wallet, could not cause significant damage to the environment, the act of “mining” bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can use more electricity each year than some countries.

What is “mining?”

“Mining” refers to the act of creating new bitcoins, and the process involves extremely high-tech computers that solve complex mathematical problems.

When bitcoin started, in 2009, it was essentially worthless. Miners could create new coins using any household computer, without expending much energy.

Now, when one bitcoin is worth about $50,000, mining requires special computer systems, and uses up tons of energy, nearly as much as is expended by the average household in 10 years.

While mining bitcoin is an expensive, energy and time consuming process, those who can create new coins can make a fortune. This has led some people and companies to purchase entire warehouses filled with computers with the only purpose of mining bitcoin all day, everyday.

Environmental impact of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will only grow

This same process of mining is used in many cryptocurrencies, but is most damaging when used for bitcoin and ethereum.

Bitcoin’s carbon footprint has become massive in the wake of this cryptocurrency mining boom.

Each year, mining bitcoin uses up 91 terra-watt hours of electricity, which is more than the nations of Argentina, with a population of 45 million, and Finland, home to 5.5 million, use in a year.

In fact, Elon Musk, one of the biggest proponents of bitcoin, has decried its environmental damage. Musk once accepted bitcoin as currency for Tesla, his forward-thinking clean energy and electric vehicle company, but reversed the decision when he learned of the massive amount of energy that is required for bitcoin.

As bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole become more popular, the damage to the environment will only grow.

In an attempt to reduce its carbon footprint, China has banned bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining, but experts warn that the ban will not stop the activity, and that miners will just move to another country to continue their work.

Many environmentally conscious proponents of cryptocurrencies have argued that mining could be powered by renewable energy, like solar or wind power.

Some argue that many miners are already using renewable energy. A study by Cambridge University shows that about 39% of bitcoin mining is conducted using alternative energy sources.

Yet the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, which are unregulated and exist outside of the realms of banks and nations, means that anonymous users can mine using any power they want.

Activists also claim that the renewable energy used to mine bitcoin could be used for more pressing matters, like in homes or vehicles.

This disastrous environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, along with their criminal potential and volatile value, has caused many to wonder if they are worth the potential benefits.

Billionaire criticizes cryptocurrencies

John Paulson, a billionaire who made his money investing in hedge funds and who predicted the huge housing crash in 2008, says all cryptocurrency, like bitcoin, is inherently “worthless” and “will go to zero.”

The investor, who was one of the few who foresaw the mortgage collapse in what has been referred to as “the greatest trade ever,” stated in a recent interview with Bloomberg Wealth that all cryptocurrency will “eventually prove to be useless.”

Bloomberg Wealth asked in their Sunday interview with Paulson if he was a believer in cryptocurrencies.

“No, I’m not,” Paulson relied, adding “And I would say that cryptocurrencies are a bubble. I would describe them as a limited supply of nothing.

“So to the extent there’s more demand than the limited supply, the price would go up. But to the extent the demand falls, then the price would go down. There’s no intrinsic value to any of the cryptocurrencies except that there’s a limited amount.”","('https://greekreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Bitcoin-credit-onov3065-cc4-wikimedia-commons.jpg',)",none

2021-09-05,The Indian Express,Explained: Crypto banking and decentralized finance,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-crypto-banking-and-decentralized-finance-7489689/,"Written by Ephrat Livni and Eric Lipton

The development of Bitcoin and thousands of other cryptocurrencies in a little over a decade has changed the definition of money — and spawned a parallel universe of alternative financial services, allowing crypto businesses to move into traditional banking territory.

Here’s what is happening in the fast-growing crypto finance industry, a sector that has officials in Washington sounding alarm bells.

What alternative banking services do crypto businesses offer?

Most notably, lending and borrowing. Investors can earn interest on their holdings of digital currencies — often a lot more than they could on cash deposits in a bank — or borrow with crypto as collateral to back a loan. Crypto loans generally involve no credit checks as transactions are backed by digital assets.

Who’s in this sector?

The market is quickly being flooded with businesses from the vaguely familiar to science fiction-like entities. They run the gamut from BlockFi, which offers interest-bearing accounts like a bank and has state lender licenses, and Kraken Bank, which was granted a Wyoming bank charter and hopes to soon take retail deposits, to markets controlled by computer code and devised to be governed by users through a token distribution structure. Compound, a decentralized, automated lending and borrowing system began in 2018 and now has more than $18 billion in assets earning interest.

How do crypto offerings differ from bank services?

Superficially, some look similar. Take the BlockFi interest account, where consumers deposit cash or crypto and earn monthly interest, as if at a bank. But one big difference is the interest rate — depositors can earn a yield more than 100 times higher on BlockFi than on average bank accounts.

Those rewards come with risks. Deposits are not guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. “Cyberattacks, extreme market conditions, or other operational or technical difficulties” could lead to a temporary or permanent halt on withdrawals or transfers, the company cautions in the fine print. Some regulators and lawmakers worry that those warnings are not prominent enough and that consumers need stronger protections.

Why such high yields?

Traditional banks lend out their customers’ deposits and pay clients a slice of the earnings as interest. Crypto outfits take a similar approach: They pool deposits to offer loans and give interest to depositors. But by law, banks are required to have reserves to ensure that even if some loans go bad, customers can still withdraw funds, whereas crypto banks do not have the same reserve requirements and the institutions they lend to can take risky bets.

BlockFi, for example, lends to hedge funds and other institutional investors who exploit flaws in crypto markets to make fast money without actually holding risky assets, betting on discrepancies between actual crypto values and crypto futures. When successful, their speculation generates returns that help fuel the higher, riskier consumer yields.

What is a stablecoin?

Crypto is very volatile, making it less practical for transactions like payments or loans. That’s where stablecoins come in. They are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets, commonly the dollar. They are meant to provide the steady value of government-issued money in digital form for blockchain transactions, but they are issued by private entities. Popular dollar-tied tokens include Tether and USD Coin. The number of stablecoins in circulation globally has jumped from $29 billion in January to $117 billion as of early September, according to The Block, a publication dedicated to cryptocurrency.

To keep the value of government-issued money stable, central bankers manage supply and demand and ensure that there are ample reserves. Stablecoin issuers are supposed to similarly hold and monitor reserves. But there is no guarantee they actually hold the one-to-one dollar backing they claim. Some authorities fear a sudden surge in withdrawals could lead to a collapse in one of those assets, putting consumers, financial companies and possibly the broader economy at risk. Others suggest a central bank digital currency would render stablecoins irrelevant.

What is a central bank digital currency?

Central bankers are examining the potential for issuance of a government-issued cryptocurrency. That would theoretically offer the convenience of crypto with the reliability of money controlled by a central bank. Many countries, including the United States, are considering developing a central bank digital currency. Because a stablecoin aims to do in digital form what government money does — provide a stable value — a US digital dollar could undermine the private money minters of the cryptosphere.

“You wouldn’t need stablecoins, you wouldn’t need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital U.S. currency — I think that’s one of the stronger arguments in its favour,” the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, said in July.

Stablecoin issuers say the government will not catch up to the innovations in the market for years — if at all. Meanwhile, the system will become more dependent on stablecoins, and it is unclear whether markets awash in those assets will abandon them altogether for a potential FedCoin.

What is DeFi?

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, loosely describes an alternative finance ecosystem where consumers transfer, trade, borrow and lend cryptocurrency, theoretically independently of traditional financial institutions and the regulatory structures that have been built around Wall Street and banking. The DeFi movement aims to “disintermediate” finance, using computer code to eliminate the need for trust and middlemen from transactions.

Practically speaking, users are not engaging with a financial services company — at least not one that collects identifying information or claims custody of their assets. It’s a computer-controlled market that automatically executes transactions, like issuing loans backed by crypto or paying interest on holdings.

DeFi platforms are structured to become independent from their developers and backers over time and to ultimately be governed by a community of users whose power comes from holding the protocol’s tokens.

By comparison, centralized finance, or CeFi, businesses more closely resemble traditional finance, or TradFi, where consumers enter into an agreement with a company like BlockFi that collects information about them, requires them to turn over their crypto and also serves as a central point for regulators.

What’s good about crypto finance?

Innovators argue that crypto fosters financial inclusion. Consumers can earn unusually high return on their holdings, unlike at banks. One in 10 American adults say they do not have a checking account and about a quarter are “underbanked” and unable to qualify for loans. Crypto businesses say they serve their needs and, outside the United States, provide financial stability for customers in countries with volatile government-issued currencies.

Crypto finance gives people long excluded by traditional institutions the opportunity to engage in transactions quickly, cheaply and without judgment, industry advocates say. Because crypto backs their loans, the services generally require no credit checks, although some take customer identity information for tax reporting and anti-fraud purposes. On a DeFi protocol, users’ personal identities are generally not shared, since they are judged solely by the value of their crypto.

What is a possible way forward?

Some regulators and innovators argue that new technology demands a new approach, saying novel risks can be addressed without necessarily crimping innovation.

For example, instead of mandating that DeFi protocols maintain the reserves of a bank and collect customer information, officials might create new kinds of requirements devised for the technology and products, like code audits and risk parameters.

Questions of identity, which are crucial to fighting financial fraud, could be addressed by flipping the old script. Instead of starting with specifics — collecting the identity of individuals — law enforcers could take the broad view, said J.

2021-09-05,Moneycontrol,"Crypto banking and decentralised finance, explained",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/crypto-banking-and-decentralised-finance-explained-7432351.html,"The development of Bitcoin and thousands of other cryptocurrencies in a little over a decade has changed the definition of money — and spawned a parallel universe of alternative financial services, allowing crypto businesses to move into traditional banking territory.

Here’s what is happening in the fast-growing crypto finance industry, a sector that has officials in Washington sounding alarm bells.

Q: What alternative banking services do crypto businesses offer?

A: Most notably, lending and borrowing. Investors can earn interest on their holdings of digital currencies — often a lot more than they could on cash deposits in a bank — or borrow with crypto as collateral to back a loan. Crypto loans generally involve no credit checks as transactions are backed by digital assets.

Q: Who’s in this sector?

A: The market is quickly being flooded with businesses from the vaguely familiar to science fiction-like entities. They run the gamut from BlockFi, which offers interest-bearing accounts like a bank and has state lender licenses, and Kraken Bank, which was granted a Wyoming bank charter and hopes to soon take retail deposits, to markets controlled by computer code and devised to be governed by users through a token distribution structure. Compound, a decentralized, automated lending and borrowing system began in 2018 and now has more than $18 billion in assets earning interest.

Q: How do crypto offerings differ from bank services?

A: Superficially, some look similar. Take the BlockFi interest account, where consumers deposit cash or crypto and earn monthly interest, as if at a bank. But one big difference is the interest rate — depositors can earn a yield more than 100 times higher on BlockFi than on average bank accounts.

Those rewards come with risks. Deposits are not guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. “Cyberattacks, extreme market conditions, or other operational or technical difficulties” could lead to a temporary or permanent halt on withdrawals or transfers, the company cautions in fine print. Some regulators and lawmakers worry that those warnings are not prominent enough and that consumers need stronger protections.

Q: Why such high yields?

A: Traditional banks lend out their customers’ deposits and pay clients a slice of the earnings as interest. Crypto outfits take a similar approach: They pool deposits to offer loans and give interest to depositors. But by law, banks are required to have reserves to ensure that even if some loans go bad, customers can still withdraw funds, whereas cryptobanks do not have the same reserve requirements and the institutions they lend to can take risky bets.

BlockFi, for example, lends to hedge funds and other institutional investors who exploit flaws in crypto markets to make fast money without actually holding risky assets, betting on discrepancies between actual crypto values and crypto futures. When successful, their speculation generates returns that help fuel the higher, riskier consumer yields.

Q: What is a stablecoin?

A: Crypto is very volatile, making it less practical for transactions like payments or loans. That’s where stablecoins come in. They are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets, commonly the dollar. They are meant to provide the steady value of government-issued money in digital form for blockchain transactions, but they are issued by private entities. Popular dollar-tied tokens include Tether and USD Coin. The number of stablecoins in circulation globally has jumped from $29 billion in January to $117 billion as of early September, according to The Block, a publication dedicated to cryptocurrency.

To keep the value of government-issued money stable, central bankers manage supply and demand and ensure that there are ample reserves. Stablecoin issuers are supposed to similarly hold and monitor reserves. But there is no guarantee they actually hold the one-to-one dollar backing they claim. Some authorities fear a sudden surge in withdrawals could lead to a collapse in one of those assets, putting consumers, financial companies and possibly the broader economy at risk. Others suggest a central bank digital currency would render stablecoins irrelevant.

Q: What is a central bank digital currency?

A: Central bankers are examining the potential for issuance of a government-issued cryptocurrency. That would theoretically offer the convenience of crypto with the reliability of money controlled by a central bank. Many countries, including the United States, are considering developing a central bank digital currency. Because a stablecoin aims to do in digital form what government money does — provide a stable value — a U.S. digital dollar could undermine the private money minters of the cryptosphere.

“You wouldn’t need stablecoins, you wouldn’t need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital U.S. currency — I think that’s one of the stronger arguments in its favor,” the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, said in July.

Stablecoin issuers say the government will not catch up to the innovations in the market for years — if at all. Meanwhile, the system will become more dependent on stablecoins, and it is unclear whether markets awash in those assets will abandon them altogether for a potential FedCoin.

2021-09-05,The Financial Express,JPMorgan says cryptocurrency markets are ‘looking frothy’ with spike in retail demand at record pace,https://www.financialexpress.com/market/jpmorgan-says-cryptocurrency-markets-are-looking-frothy-with-spike-in-retail-demand-at-record-pace/2324406/,"JPMorgan in April this year had said it is using the blockchain technology to improve funds transfers between banking institutions globally.

Global investment bank JPMorgan, which had reportedly started offering its wealth management clients access to cryptocurrency funds recently, has said cryptocurrency markets are “looking frothy” as the stock-buying frenzy among retail investors spilled over into altcoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in August. In a note published earlier this week on the stock market and cryptocurrencies, JPMorgan noted that retail investors had purchased stocks at a record pace during the summer – almost $16 billion of record high net flow in July and around $13 billion in August into the US stock market, estimated by the investment bank, according to bitcoin.com. The crypto market value had gained around 83 per cent over the last three months, led by altcoins.

“Cryptocurrency markets [are] looking frothy again,” the note read. Bitcoin’s share in the overall crypto market cap had declined from 47 per cent on August 1 to 41.32 per cent on Sunday while Ethereum’s (ETH) grew slightly from 18 per cent to 20 per cent, followed by Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin, and Tether with respective share of 4.01 per cent, 3.62 per cent, and 2.91 per cent in total crypto market cap, as per Coinmarketcap. According to bitcoin.com, Solana has become among the top-performing coins this year. The crypto at the price of $141.04 per coin is now the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The coin had market cap of $40.78 billion, at the time of filing this report. It had gained 310.8 per cent during the last month and 3,277.6 per cent year-to-date.

According to the JPMorgan analysts, altcoin trading represented around 33 per cent of the crypto market currently, stressing about the growth from the 22 per cent in early August. “The share of altcoins looks rather elevated by historical standards and in our opinion it is more likely to be a reflection of froth and retail investor ‘mania’ rather than a reflection of a structural uptrend.”

JPMorgan in April this year had said it is using the blockchain technology to improve funds transfers between banking institutions globally. The bank had launched ‘Confirm’ to help bring down the number of “rejected or returned transactions caused by mismatched payment details,” according to the investment banking company. As a result, the solution will lead to lowering costs for both the sending and receiving banks. Confirm is a global account information validation application on JPMorgan’s blockchain network through which partner banking institutions, according to the company, will be able to request confirmation of the beneficiary account information and receive responses directly from other participating banks receiving the requests in near-real-time.","('https://images.financialexpress.com/2021/04/jpmorgan.jpg',)",none

The latest gains have been mirrored by other leading cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ether) and Cardano (ada), which are both trading close to record highs.

The overall crypto market is now worth more than $2.35 trillion, marking the highest point since May, and just $150 billion away from the record highs it experienced earlier this year.

Some analysts have forecast a second leg of the bull run that took BTC to an all-time high in mid April of $64,000.

One price prediction from pseudonymous Dutch analyst PlanB puts bitcoin on a trajectory towards $100k+ before the end of 2021, however less positive forecasts claim that the cryptocurrency is in the middle of a so-called “dead cat bounce” that will result in new yearly lows below $20k.

Twitter, a microblogging network, maybe working on ways for users to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum payments. Alessandro Paluzzi, an Italian mobile developer, tweeted pictures indicating that users will soon be able to add their Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses to their Twitter profiles.

According to Paluzzi, the goal is to allow users to receive cryptocurrency tips via the Tip Jar function. Users can utilise the service to send money to other people's accounts.

Back in July, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey hinted that Bitcoin might be integrated with the Tip Jar. Paluzzi posted photographs yesterday revealing that Twitter is testing the option to tip in bitcoin through the Bitcoin Lightning app Strike.

Paluzzi posted a screenshot on Twitter demonstrating how users would be aware that they will be able to receive cryptocurrency tips via the social media platform. While sources suggest that Twitter is leveraging Strike's services to issue Bitcoin invoices over the Lightning Network, Paluzzi claims that adding Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to your profile does not require linking a Strike account.

It's unclear when Twitter plans to make this feature available to users. Given the current trend, Twitter may initially just make this functionality available to users in the United States, since cryptocurrency use has yet to reach or become mainstream in many places.

Twitter recently launched the long-awaited Super Follow function, which allows creators and influencers to charge their followers for access to exclusive content. This feature has also begun to go out to users in the United States and Canada.

2021-09-05,Cointelegraph,Cryptocurrency can actually make a difference by helping people,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-can-actually-make-a-difference-by-helping-people,"Between Bitcoin (BTC) breaking the $50,000 hurdle and the upswell in the altcoin markets, crypto has never been more appealing to speculators. But, stacking profits through trading is worthless unless that money is spent. Luckily, charitable organizations are waking up to the possibility of crypto donations as the world embraces crypto. For blockchain entrepreneur Wendy O, when a local gym was in jeopardy, she knew to tap into crypto Twitter for help. Using social media, her YouTube channel and Tik-Tok, the influencer sent out the call to save a business dear to her heart.

The Self Care Lab is a boxing gym located in Pomona, CA which caters to underprivileged and at-risk youth. Owner Nita Watson recently discovered that the ownership of the gym’s building had changed hands and she had a mere 30 days to vacate and find a new home for a community she had spent years building up.

Thankfully, Wendy O is a long-time client of the gym and a strong proponent of using physical fitness to uplift the youth. Wendy tapped into her network of blockchain enthusiasts, traders, entrepreneurs, and self-declared “degens” to raise the funds to not only move locations but upgrade various, worn-down pieces of equipment. While the gym’s Go Fund Me page has not reached its final goal, she and other members are optimistic they will raise enough donations in fiat and crypto to secure a new location. Wendy O told Cointelegraph:

“This gym has been such a massive part of my life and I can’t imagine where I’d be without it. It’s more than boxing, it’s about self-care and therapy. And a lot of these kids need a positive place like this to keep them focused and out of other less-productive activities. As someone who’s made a living in crypto, I knew I could count on my friends to step in and make a difference.”

However, the innovation didn’t stop at allowing crypto donations. To capture the attention of the nascent blockchain art community, Wendy O successfully launched a series of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on the Theta blockchain, with thousands sold so far. Two of these NFTs are redeemable for consulting sessions with Wendy O, injecting some utility into the donations. Bridging the gap between speculators and charity is a relatively new phenomenon in the decentralized asset ecosystem, though it will likely be more popular as more well-known names in the space begin leveraging crypto for charitable causes. By avoiding payment operators, middle-men and third-party processors, more of each crypto donation is able to be received.

Other projects have long accepted donations in Bitcoin including the Kessler Foundation and the Dementia Society of America. Most recently, the PAWS Animal Rescue in Chicago began accepting donations in Dogecoin (DOGE). Even though there are no NFTs involved in the case of PAWS, the appeal of helping dogs with such a popular canine-themed token seems undeniable.

Most recently, the blockchain sector has been supporting charities focused on assisting humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan. As thousands of refugees seek new homes all over the world, nonprofits are stepping up to take action. Consulting firm Visualize Value recently joined forces with CARE to sell NFTs that cover a family’s emergency needs.

As impactful as these donations are, it may be the convenience of crypto that ultimately drives more users to send funds. Generally speaking, the traditional route to donate online includes filling out a lengthy form, manually inputting credit card info and other steps to complete a donation. In contrast, for crypto investors comfortable making blockchain transactions, sending BTC or Ether (ETH) is second nature. Instead of bidding on penguin NFTs, in this case, they are helping a just cause.

A casual glance at some of the posts on Crypto Twitter may seem a bit strange. Timelines are filled with random shills, various scams, traders celebrating their wins and stories of people losing untold sums due to bad trading practices. While it may seem like a rough crowd to an outsider, however, those who can navigate the space are able to find charitable diamonds in the rough.

Players include Compound, a company in San Francisco that operates completely outside the regulatory system. DeFi eliminates human intermediaries like brokers, bank clerks and traders, and instead uses algorithms to execute financial transactions, such as lending and borrowing.

“Crypto is the new shadow bank,” Ms. Warren said in an interview. “It provides many of the same services, but without the consumer protections or financial stability that back up the traditional system.”

“It’s like spinning straw into gold,” she added.

Lawmakers and regulators are worried that consumers are not always fully aware of the potential dangers of the new banklike crypto services and decentralized finance platforms. Crypto deposit accounts are not federally insured and holdings may not be guaranteed if markets go haywire.

People who borrow against their crypto could face liquidation of their holdings, sometimes in entirely automated markets that are unregulated.

From Pawnbroker to Bank

BlockFi’s extraordinary growth — and the recent crackdown by state regulators — illustrates the fraught path of cryptocurrency financial services companies amid confusion about what they do.

BlockFi’s business is not dissimilar to that of a regular bank. It takes deposits of cryptocurrencies and pays interest on them. It makes loans in dollars to people who put up cryptocurrency as collateral. And it lends crypto to institutions that need it.

For consumers, the main allure of BlockFi is the chance to take loans in dollars up to half of the value of their crypto collateral, allowing customers to get cash without the tax hit of selling their digital assets, or to leverage the value of holdings to buy more cryptocurrency. The company also offers interest of up to 8 percent per year on crypto deposits, compared with a national average of 0.06 percent for savings deposits at banks in August.","('https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/09/05/us/politics/00DC-CryptoBank-Illo/00DC-CryptoBank-Illo-facebookJumbo.jpg',)",none

The primary goal of the bill is to define the cryptocurrency according to the technology used in it.



It is expected to shed light on the tax treatment of these digital assets and will also define how they are classified .



It is proposed that in India, crypto tokens should be recognized as digital assets as opposed to currency.



The policies on exchange ownership parameters, KYC , accounting and reporting standards and so on should be clarified.



, accounting and reporting standards and so on should be clarified. The cryptocurrency assets that were defined and classified by the government would only be allowed to trade in India. The crypto coins would then be taxed accordingly.



It has been suggested to apply a similar tax to the Security Transaction Tax (STT) in the coming times. It has also been said that these digital assets could also be entitled to income tax if they are indeed classified as commodities.



The income from the crypto trading could be taxed as business income in the hands of investors at normal rates of income tax.



With swift penetration and investment of over $6.6 billion in May 2021 in India’s crypto economy, it becomes all the more imperative now to have a well regulated mechanism. In light of this, the Economic Times reports that India’s upcoming cryptocurrency bill broadly aims to define and classify cryptocurrency assets in India. As per the report, currently the government is focussed on the end-use of the assets for regulatory purposes.In the report submitted by inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency, few of the provisions and suggestions laid down in the bill are:This would be the first time however that cryptocurrency would be defined and segmented on the basis of technology used. However, the working of the regulatory framework of cryptocurrency would become clearer and unambiguous to understand once the bill is approved and enacted. For instance, the manner in which assets will be taxed or regulated, or whether cryptocurrencies will be considered as commodities or currencies are yet not clear.Some big players in the crypto exchange have voiced optimism and hope for the new bill.

2021-09-05,California News Times,Cryptocurrencies: developing countries provide fertile ground,https://californianewstimes.com/cryptocurrencies-developing-countries-provide-fertile-ground/512089/,"In Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, a software coder bills her client in London and is paid in bitcoin, sidestepping a costly banking system and the naira currency’s miserly official exchange rate. In São Paulo, Brazil, a dentist puts his monthly savings into an exchange traded fund investing in a basket of cryptocurrencies that is the second most popular ETF on the local bourse. Individuals and businesses in Vietnam invest, trade and transact so much in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that the south-east Asian nation has the world’s highest rate of crypto adoption.

In advanced economies, cryptocurrencies are viewed by many in the financial world with suspicion — the domain of zealous “crypto bros” and a speculative and highly volatile fad that can only end badly. Regulators in Europe and the US have issued stark warnings about the dangers of trading crypto.

But in the developing world, there are signs that crypto is quietly building deeper roots. Especially in countries which have a history of financial instability or where the barriers to accessing traditional financial products such as bank accounts are high, cryptocurrency use is fast becoming a fact of daily life.

“While everyone was paying attention to [Tesla chief executive] Elon Musk’s tweets, and which institutional investor or CEO was saying what they thought about bitcoin, there was this entire story unravelling in emerging markets around the world that’s really powerful,” says Kim Grauer, director of research at Chainalysis, a leading data company in the sector.

“There’s a massive crypto footprint in many of these countries . . . [and] a massive amount of entrepreneurial opportunity.”

Chainalysis ranks Vietnam first for crypto adoption worldwide — one of 19 emerging and frontier markets in its top 20, with only the US among advanced economies making an appearance at number eight in 2021. “It’s very striking this year, [adoption] is a story of emerging and frontier markets,” adds Grauer.

Separate data from UsefulTulips.org, tracking bitcoin transactions on the world’s two biggest peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms, show that in the past few weeks, sub-Saharan Africa has overtaken North America to become the geographical region with the highest volume of this kind of crypto activity.

On Tuesday, the small central American nation of El Salvador — population 6.4m — will become the first in the world to make bitcoin legal tender, meaning merchants from car dealers to coffee shops will be obliged to accept it as payment. The project faces the scepticism of the IMF, among others. But some view it as groundbreaking.

“We should take it very seriously,” says Paul Domjan, co-author of the 2021 book Chain Reaction: How Blockchain Will Transform the Developing World. “It changes the position of bitcoin in the [global financial] system and it accelerates the whole debate about digital currencies.”

An alternative to weak currencies

Emerging markets are fertile ground for cryptocurrencies, often because their own are failing to do their job. As a store of value, as a means of exchange and as a unit of account, national currencies in some developing countries too often fall short. Unpredictable inflation and fast-moving exchange rates, clunky and expensive banking systems, financial restrictions and regulatory uncertainty, especially the existence or threat of capital controls, all undermine their appeal.

Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, is a case in point. Its impatient, youthful population has to contend daily with high unemployment, the vagaries of black market currency exchanges and capital controls. As the price of oil, the country’s main export, dropped during the pandemic and further squeezed dollar supply, many businesses were unable to pay foreign suppliers and lenders, almost leading to the default of a World Bank-backed power plant that provides a tenth of Nigeria’s electricity. For individuals sending or receiving remittances or billing customers, the lack of dollars is a constant headache.

“When you touch boots to the ground in Africa, specifically Nigeria, and talk to people about their everyday challenges with money, you see that it is almost unfathomable to us in the west to imagine,” says Ray Youssef, chief executive of Paxful, a peer-to-peer crypto exchange that allows users to trade directly with one another. In these transactions, bitcoin are held in escrow accounts by the platform until the payment clears — whether by bank transfer, mobile money or gift card.

A third of the company’s users are in Africa, and Nigeria is its biggest market, the company says, with 1.5m users — an 83 per cent increase in the year to June. Peer-to-peer rival LocalBitcoins also has most of its customers in developing markets in Latin America and Africa, as well as Russia.

Transactions vary in size, from retail investors buying small amounts of crypto for under $100, to merchants settling invoices, to financial services businesses that have been built on these platforms and employ rosters of people. “There’s a lot of commerce happening between China and Nigeria, importing of goods using cryptocurrency, because the foreign exchange policy has locked out the everyday entrepreneur who doesn’t have a massive amount of money to get into international trade,” says Grauer.

In countries such as Venezuela and Brazil, the cost and bureaucracy of legacy financial systems means many people are more comfortable experimenting with and switching between different cryptocurrencies.

“We thought that people would adopt one cryptocurrency and that would be their primary one, and what we have found instead is they use different ones for different purposes,” says Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core Group, a cryptocurrency network that first entered Venezuela in 2016. Coins such as Dash get used more for smaller purchases, bitcoin for larger ones because of higher fees, and litecoin for things like paying satellite bills, he says.

The big exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase still dominate crypto services throughout the developing world. In Latin America, central and south Asia and Africa, more than 80 per cent of cryptocurrencies by value sent to these regions moves through exchanges. Binance sent over $14bn worth of crypto to eastern Europe in the year to June 2020, accounting for 20 per cent of all funds sent through the exchange globally. It was also the exchange of choice in Latin America, sending more than $3bn in crypto to the region over the same period.

It also offers an alternative to traditional remittances, a crucial lifeline for many developing economies. Transferring money back and forth across borders through traditional channels such as Western Union can be prohibitively expensive.

“If you want to send money to the African country next door, it’s a veritable nightmare, and sending money outside of Africa — to America, Europe, China, whatever it may be — is almost impossible unless you are rich,” says Youssef.

According to the World Bank, the cost of sending $200 to countries in sub-Saharan Africa averaged 9 per cent of the transaction value in the first quarter of 2020, the highest of any world region, and can go into double digits in some places.

On peer-to-peer crypto networks, however, these fees are typically about 2-5 per cent, according to LocalBitcoins. Average transaction fees for bitcoin were below $3 in August 2021, according to data provider BitInfoCharts, while for ethereum they ranged between $8 and $44 over the same period.

But some observers believe there are considerable dangers in cryptocurrencies being used for remittances or other payments.

Paola Subacchi, professor of international economics at the University of London’s Queen Mary Global Policy Institute, says a better solution for migrant workers would be to reduce the cost of remittances. “This is a bad remedy for a problem that should be solved using technology we already have.”

She adds: “Cryptocurrencies and crypto companies present themselves as instruments for financial inclusion, but those excluded from traditional financial facilities are precisely those who can least afford to take any risks with their money.”

More mainstream investment

As with peers in advanced economies, there is plenty of speculative fervour in parts of the developing world about bitcoin – especially in middle-income countries.

Yet crypto investment has already made greater inroads into the investment mainstream in some emerging markets than it has in advanced ones.

In the US and the UK, for example, regulators have yet to approve the creation of cryptocurrency ETFs, which allow investors to gain exposure to the potential gains and losses of bitcoin and others without directly owning any themselves. Brazil this year became one of only a handful of countries where cryptocurrency ETFs are available.

Hashdex Asset Management has launched three regulated crypto ETFs on the São Paulo stock exchange this year, which together have over 160,000 investors.

Its flagship fund, HASH11, tracks an index co-developed with Nasdaq based on a basket of crypto assets. Charging a 1.3 per cent management fee, it currently has net assets of R$2.17bn ($421m), and is the second-most owned ETF on the bourse.

Marcelo Sampaio, Hashdex chief executive, describes its customer base as “the mainstream financial market”.

“It’s the whole range from the largest institutional investors in the country to the smallest average Joe investors in the stock exchange,” he says.

Hashdex continued to attract new investors during downturns in the crypto market, such as recent dips provoked by Tesla’s decision to no longer accept bitcoin payments and China’s crackdown on crypto mining. “What that shows is that even with a severe correction in the market they were investing long-term,” Sampaio says.

Brazil is the leading country in Latin America for cryptocurrency users, with 10.4m people, according to analysis by TripleA, a Singapore-based provider of crypto payment solutions.

Crypto’s growing popularity in Brazil is demonstrated by local exchange Mercado Bitcoin, whose total transaction volumes were up sevenfold by the end of August compared with 2020. The company recently secured a $200m investment from the Japanese technology group SoftBank and its customers have doubled to 2.8m in the past year.

“In Brazil, almost all activity is related to investments and trading,” says Daniel Cunha, a Mercado Bitcoin executive. “[But] in Argentina, stable coins have a very important presence as a strategy to defend [against the changing] value of the currency. In Mexico, the use of crypto for remittances represents a very large part of the market.”

Leapfrog to blockchain

The speed with which many developing countries have taken to crypto is not the first example of such early-adopter behaviour.

Perhaps the best-known modern example is M-Pesa, a mobile payment system first developed in Kenya that allowed millions of people without bank accounts to make cash withdrawals and deposits, transfers and payments through their mobile phones, delivering financial inclusion through technological innovation.

To some enthusiasts of the new currencies, the spread of crypto is the first stage in the next great leap, as users get used to trusting the so-called distributed ledger technology (DLT) of which blockchain — the backbone of crypto — is one application.

In Chain Reaction, Domjan and his co-authors note that institutions of trust, including the holders of public records such as land registries and licensing agencies, tend to be weaker in the developing world. And, they argue, where you see such weaknesses, it is easier for DLT or blockchain-based systems to be “good enough” to offer an attractive alternative.

“It seems rational to expect such innovation . . . to have the biggest impact in developing countries,” they write.

Domjan says such applications could unlock a host of “dead capital” to feed investment and growth.

Warnings of instability

While crypto acolytes are excited about El Salvador’s bitcoin currency experiment, most regulators have greeted it more frostily.

After El Salvador’s announcement, the IMF warned in late July of the dangers inherent in countries adopting cryptocurrencies as legal tender. The US-based multilateral lender said that widespread use of the volatile tokens could undermine “macroeconomic stability” and potentially expose financial systems to widespread illicit activity.

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has warned that “if consumers invest in these types of products, they should be prepared to lose all their money”. The Basel committee of global banking regulators said in June that “the growth of crypto assets and related services has the potential to raise financial stability concerns and increase risks faced by banks” — including fraud, hacking and terrorist financing.

Consumer protection, particularly from scams large and small, is a huge concern in crypto markets. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable in poorer countries often pay the price. “There’s a lot of hype around [crypto], so I think people may be more willing to invest where they’re more desperate,” says Grauer.

Many national regulators have found themselves ill-equipped to deal with digital asset companies that claim not to be domiciled anywhere.

In countries such as Zimbabwe, regulators have come down hard on crypto ventures, only to reverse their positions. Zimbabwe’s central bank has said it is drafting a policy framework for regulating cryptocurrencies, after banning local banks from transacting with them in 2018. In Nigeria, the central bank banned commercial banks from dealing with companies involved in cryptocurrency transactions — which quickly found a workaround using third-party accounts.

Some observers, including the Central Bank of Nigeria, have expressed concerns that inexperienced investors could lose their meagre savings gambling on a highly speculative asset. “Small retail and unsophisticated investors also face high probability of loss due to the high volatility of the investments in recent times,” the bank said, as it sought to clamp down on the trade

But while most crypto services say they are keen to comply with regulators, they believe excessive bureaucracy will drive people to seek out their services. “If a central bank decides to impose some direct form of restrictions on their people, you will see a flood of those people coming to [crypto platforms] looking for help,” says Youssef. “They all move with the flux of the geopolitical world, and we have to be ready for that.”

In El Salvador, the government has decided that rather than clamping down on crypto, it should embrace it. For Domjan, whether the project succeeds or fails, it has changed the game.

“El Salvador is a genuine country,” he says. “It’s not under sanctions, it’s a member of the IMF, it is inserted in the international financial system. The point is, it confers an element of legitimacy. We will learn lessons about how a country could implement an internationally tradable digital currency as a means of settlement.”

2021-09-05,The Economic Times,Exodus of cryptocurrency machines from China,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/exodus-of-crypto-currency-machines-from-china/articleshow/85941332.cms,"The Communist Party of China's unrelenting crackdown on cryptocurrencies has caused massive issues for Bit Digital and other cryptocurrency mining companies, which are now scrambling to migrate their machines out of China.Bit Digital Inc., a Nasdaq-listed firm based in New York, has upped its efforts to move over 20,000 machines from China, it has been learnt. These high-powered computers are at the core of the New York-based firm, which makes its money by tapping them into cheap electricity sources so they can crack mathematical problems and unlock new bitcoin. Despite being the world's largest bitcoin mining hub, China has intensified its stranglehold on cryptocurrency mining and trade. China mined two-thirds of the world's bitcoins in 2020; in other words, until last year, Chinese bitcoin mining accounted for around 65 percent of global mining.To power mining activities in China, electricity is generated from massive dams, experts on the subject pointed out. It has been learnt that the majority of bitcoin is mined in Xinjiang , where Beijing has waged a brutal onslaught against Uyghur Muslim minorities.Furthermore, the Chinese have subsidised hydropower, making bitcoin mining even more affordable in China when compared to other regions of the world. However, Bitcoin mining uses a lot of energy, at 112.57 terawatt-hours each year. In other words, cryptocurrencies come at a high environmental cost. China alone would have emitted 113 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide if the crackdown on cryptocurrencies had not been undertaken. It's worth noting that China has always prioritised economic growth over pollution prevention, has repeatedly declined to invest in green alternatives, and runs the majority of its industrial infrastructure on coal or hydropower. The ""environmental"" justification for the recent crackdown on cryptocurrency is a charade, according to experts on Chinese economy.The Chinese Communist regime has a tight grasp on every area of its citizens' life, and thus bitcoin's decentralised and undetectable aspect does not sit well with Beijing. The Communist Party's model of governance, which is essentially autocratic and tyrannical, is alien to the ostensibly freewheeling world of cryptocurrencies.In 2017, the country proscribed all crypto currency trading platforms from converting cryptocurrencies into legal tender and vice versa, along with shutting down all Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Inner Mongolia, one of China's leading mining hotspots, accounts for 8% of global bitcoin mining. The region has proposed punishments for companies & individuals engaged in bitcoin minings; companies could have their business license annulled if they are found to be involved in the mining of cryptocurrencies.The Chinese government's abrupt onslaught on Bitcoin is therefore driven by the fact that cryptocurrency represents a fundamental threat to state monetary sovereignty, according to one of the above mentioned experts. The greater the popularity of cryptocurrencies among Chinese citizens, the less authority Beijing has over monetary policy. If a government's political legitimacy isn't acquired via elections, it must be obtained through other means, such as economic achievements. The Communist Party's political acceptability in China is predicated on the country's economic growth. Any threat to economic stability and development, or the financial system that sustains it, is a threat to China's political structure as well.Instead, China has come up with its own version of state-backed digital currency, the ""digital yuan,"" which would eventually give the Communist regime absolute control over every penny spent by Chinese citizens. In other words, the CCP has adopted blockchain technology without decentralisation, and hence according to Beijing the state-backed digital currency overcomes one of bitcoin's primary downsides- the user's obscurity.The cornerstone to the Communist Party's incontrovertible hegemony is complete control over the flow of ideas, money, and information. The unregulated world of cryptocurrencies represents a threat to the tyrannical communist regime's dominance, experts feel.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85941325,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81020,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg',)",none

Most of the complaints were made in August, according to a news release from the Delta Police Department.

""Unfortunately their losses have been significant, ranging from just under $5,000 to over $100,000 in one file,"" police said in their release.

Police said there are ""a number of common factors"" in the six files that have been reported to them.

In most of the cases, the scammers contacted the victims through online platforms - such as dating sites and chat apps - and established a relationship with them.

""Investors were typically encouraged to e-transfer funds from their bank accounts to mobile wallets, and from there to unknown accounts,"" Delta police said. ""When victims tried to withdraw their 'profits' or investment, the money was either gone, or the victim was informed they needed to pay considerable additional fees to access their money.""

Police said would-be investors should research the name of the investment company or website they're considering to see if anyone else has been scammed. Investors should also avoid taking advice from people online who they've never met, police said.

For reputable information for investors, Delta police recommend visiting the websites of the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Canadian Securities Administrators.","('https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1717992.1394149852!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg',)",none

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has some suggestions of what he personally would like to see happening with Dogecoin and the meme cryptocurrency’s cooperation with Ethereum.

Vitalik Buterin on Dogecoin’s Development and Its Ethereum Collaboration

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his thoughts on the potential cooperation between Dogecoin and Ethereum Wednesday as part of a Twitter experiment he is conducting where only the 268 people he followed can ask him questions.

Three Arrows Capital CEO Zhu Su asked: “What are some promising ideas for Ethereum / Doge cooperation? What was it about Doge that got you interested in the project?” Su recently said that he is “very bullish” on dogecoin and that the meme cryptocurrency has “no risk of it having any regulatory issues ever.”

Referencing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW), Buterin replied to Su:

Personally, I hope that doge can switch to PoS soon, perhaps using Ethereum code. I also hope they don’t cancel the 5b/year annual PoW issuance, instead they put it in some kind of DAO that funds global public goods. Would fit well with dogecoin’s non-greedy wholesome ethos.

In June, Buterin also talked about potential cooperation between Ethereum and Dogecoin. “If Doge wants to somehow bridge to Ethereum, and then people can trade DOGE thousands of times a second inside of loopring, then that would be amazing,” the Ethereum co-founder opined. “I think if we can have a secure Doge-to-Ethereum bridge. That would be amazing, and then when Ethereum gets any scalability that works for Ethereum assets, you would be able to trade wrapped DOGE with very low transaction fees and very high speed as well,” he further said.

In August, the Dogecoin Foundation relaunched with Buterin as one of its board advisors, along with Jared Birchall, a close associate of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, another prominent dogecoin supporter.

Among numerous questions Buterin received as part of his Twitter experiment was whether he was likely to create another cryptocurrency. The Ethereum co-founder simply responded with “No.”

According to a recent report, the National Football League (NFL) advised teams that they could not, at least for now, sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and sponsorships to digital currency companies. Advertisements for specific crypto assets were mentioned alongside initial coin offerings (ICOs), according to various club sources who remained anonymous.

Anonymous Club Sources Disclose the NFL’s New Policy

On Friday, The Athletic reported that sources familiar with the matter detail that the NFL is barring teams from participating in certain crypto ventures. The NFL’s alleged ban follows a great number of blockchain, NFT, and cryptocurrency endorsements from a number of star athletes and teams.

For instance, Tom Brady has shown his support for bitcoin with laser eyes, but he’s also started his own NFT company called Autograph. Brady and his Brazilian supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen also signed a long-term partnership with FTX.

But the seven-time Super Bowl champion is not the only one dipping into the crypto economy. The world’s largest cryptocurrency asset manager, Grayscale Investments, has partnered with the New York Giants. Trevor Lawrence, the NFL’s No. 1 Draft Pick, put his signing bonus into crypto in May. NFL player and offensive lineman Russell Okung gets half of his salary in bitcoin (BTC).

Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes released a collection of NFTs on Makersplace on March 17th. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers player, Rob “Gronk” Gronkowski, sold an NFT collection as well. Moreover, MLB and the National Basketball Association (NBA) have both gotten involved in the crypto asset and non-fungible token space.

“Multiple club sources” from the NFL told The Athletic contributor Daniel Kaplan teams cannot contribute to this space at the moment. An anonymous NFL team official read the following:

Clubs are prohibited from selling, or otherwise allowing within club controlled media, advertisements for specific cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings, other cryptocurrency sales or any other media category as it relates to blockchain, digital asset or as blockchain company, except as outlined in this policy.

NFL’s New Policy Does Allow Specific Crypto Partnerships

The report does not disclose if any negative repercussions have been felt by those who have already participated with crypto firms or if they have been granted immunity for now. If the report holds weight, the NFL’s action may just stop players and teams from following the lead of other clubs and players.

The NFL’s purported new policy does allow sponsorships with firms “whose primary business is providing investment advisory and or fund management services in connection with cryptocurrency, provided that such advertising sponsorship rights are limited to promoting the company’s corporate brands,” the anonymous source concluded.

It’s that time of the year again where we remember and reminisce our teachers who unlocked a completely new world for us every time we saw them-the words of Shakespeare, the law of demand and supply, preparing cash flow statements, deriving square, cube roots, or simply, and most importantly, supporting and teaching us how to overcome rejections, failures and uncertainties, learnings that probably stay with us for a lifetime!

And another great teacher that most of us encountered and lived with as we grew up was perhaps the many gems of the Indian film industry. Bollywood has, over the years, given us many, many iconic stories and teachers who have made us crush hard, cry harder, but most surely, learn and imbibe the hardest. Let's face it, every time we venture into uncharted, unknown waters, or even in the face of extreme adversity, we always wish for someone to guide, counsel, and direct us.

But who do you turn to when it comes to seeking advice about jumping aboard on your journey into something as nascent, evolving, and new as the crypto-verse? There’s so much to detangle, learn and decipher here that a good teacher can certainly come in handy! And what better than to revisit the advice of some of the legendary Bollywood teachers and students to give you the perfect, right push you need? Read on:





Remember when

Munnabhai

endearingly tells

Circuit

about the number of bones the human body has? “206

type ka sirf haddi hai, todne ke time apun log sochte they kya?”

There are currently 11,602 cryptocurrencies in circulation! How do you decide which one to invest in?





According to Sharan Nair, CBO, Coin Switch Kuber, “The nascent cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving with different, newer coins, concepts and players regularly coming to the fore. The adoption of cryptocurrency in India is on the rise, making literacy about the same crucial since it is a new asset class that has many misconceptions floating around. Thus, in order to get the best returns and investment security, investors should proactively educate themselves on the different types of coins available.”





The answer, therefore, is simple! For a

Mazza ni crypto-investing/trading life,

research is paramount. The whitepaper of the concerned currency is a good place to start off your research, because it provides a deep dive into its practical use cases, scalability potential, roadmap, community engagement, growth prospects, and underlying applications, among others.









Turns out, when

Ram Shankar Nikumbh

from Taare Zameen Par said that,

“

Har bachche ki apni khoobi hoti hai, apni kabiliyat hoti hai, apni chahat hoti hai”

, he didn't just refer to Ishaan. Every cryptocurrency comes with a different value offering.

For instance, Bitcoin is widely considered to be a great store of value and an upcoming inflationary hedge, while Ethereum aims to usher in Web 3.0, while Cardano aims to negate the real-world massive environmental and energy issues that plague crypto-mining. Hence, it is important that you take a closer look into the underlying technology, fundamentals, and future potential of the coin you wish to invest in, along with assessing their vision, purpose, and the management quality backing it.

Ramalingam Subramanian, the head of Brand & Communication at CoinDCX, which launched DCX Learn in 2020 and aims to onboard 50 million investors in the times to come, sees huge, untapped potential in the crypto-education market. “We had identified the need to create awareness about cryptocurrency and blockchain among the public. We strongly believe that having a better understanding of crypto can help make informed decisions and also reap the benefits of investing in digital assets. Having this thought process in mind, we developed the platform to guide people through numerous informative digital content such as articles, online courses, interactive lectures, and much more,” he elaborates.

Finding the right ‘Gunda’

We swooned with SRK in Chak De India! as he broodingly, yet clearly announced how

“Har team mein bas ek hi gunda ho sakta hai, Aur is team ka gunda mein hun!









Turns out, your cryptocurrency portfolio also needs a few reliable, stable

gundas

-namely market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which command over 60 percent of the whole cryptoverse between them.









Sure, exponential yet short-term rises on a 7-day basis in relatively lesser-known currencies like XRP (10 percent), Solana (52 percent), Litecoin (25 percent), and Polkadot (28 percent) can be extremely tempting, but it's also a dangerous move in this highly

frenzied, speculative and volatile market. So, make sure you do not risk it all in unregulated, vague currencies the lure of making quick gains. Stick predominantly to the mains and the big-shots!









Prateek Singh, Founder, LearnApp, which recently launched an extensive, comprehensive course for crypto-trading and backtesting strategies for beginners, concurs. “B

asically, as a first-time investor, there are only two investments you can make right now, which are Bitcoin and Etherium. Everything else is very difficult for a first-time investor to decide whether the fundamentals are strong or not. While there are many transformative, positive developments in this space as well, understanding them might not be as easy for everyone. If you are a long-term investor and believe in cryptocurrency as a digital asset, investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum are the simplest ways to start,” he explains.









“9th mein Pokemon, 10th mein PUBG, 11th mein Kota. Kyun? Sharma ji puchenge toh batayenge, Kota mein IIT NEET ki taiyari kar rahe hain. Cool lagta hai, fashion hai! Yeh jo akhbaron mein ishtihaar, hoardings 100% selection guaranteed dekh ke tum chale aate ho na...

!”









If Jeetu Bhaiya from Kota Factory was your mentor in navigating the world of cryptocurrency, he would say the same thing-the idea of earning 1000 percent profits traps you in, but there’s no guarantee of this, at all. The market is very erratic, uncertain, you can win big one day, or you can lose it all.









As Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex puts it, “The use cases of blockchain make it a compelling catalyst for the upliftment of mainstream finance. Different estimates suggest that more than 15 million Indians invest in these speculative markets. However, the bulk of these investors have little to no knowledge of the basics of cryptocurrencies and invest simply hoping to multiply returns overnight. This approach is quite short-sighted.”









Crypto markets are not always kind to those looking to make immediate profits. Therefore, invest wisely, and invest only your surplus amount, or the amount you can afford to lose, without significantly denting or eroding your other financial investments.

2021-09-04,Markets Insider,A father and son who help clients find forgotten crypto passwords estimate billions of dollars worth of lost bitcoin is recoverable,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/locked-crypto-wallet-password-recovery-cryptocurrency-chris-charlie-brooks-btc-2021-9,"Charlie and Chris Brooks run Crypto Asset Recovery, a small business in New Hampshire. Crypto Asset Recovery

A father and son team of computer programmers help people find lost passwords to their crypto wallets.

Chris and Charlie Brooks conducted an analysis that led them to estimate between 68,110 and 92,855 seemingly lost bitcoins are recoverable.

At current prices, the high end of the recoverable bitcoin estimate amounts to $4.7 billion.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

For Chris and Charlie Brooks, finding lost passwords to cryptocurrency wallets requires figuring out how their clients' minds work - and that effort can help their customers retrieve a slice of what the pair estimates is about $4.7 billion worth of recoverable bitcoin stranded in locked wallets.

""We get a really broad spectrum of clients. We have a client who is an early-stage miner in bitcoin who lost all of his information and he knows he's got some bitcoins somewhere … We get clients who were told in 2017 to buy into the hype-bubble and they bought $1,000 [worth] and they are looking for something to cover the rent,"" Charlie, a 20-year-old computer programmer who joined his father in running Crypto Asset Recovery based in New Hampshire, told Insider in a video interview.

""One of our most recent cracks had about $250,000,"" in a blockchain wallet, said Charlie, who majored in computer science in college. He's put school aside for now to work at the business. ""This is something I've always liked. I would follow along with my dad ... Online treasure hunting, it seemed really cool.""

Nearly 40% of 1,000 US crypto owners in a recent survey from Cryptovantage said they had lost wallet passwords and, on average, those unable to find their passwords lost $2,134.

The jumping-off point of the duo's estimate of what can be recovered was a Chainalysis estimate that up to 20% of 18.5 million existing bitcoin appear to be lost or stranded in locked wallets. The figures were cited in January by The New York Times in a story about a San Francisco-based programmer who couldn't find the password to the hard drive that stored his 7,002 bitcoin. After eight wrong guesses, he had two left to figure out the password before the virtual currency was likely lost forever.

The Chainalysis figure sparked a question for the Brookses.

""Yes, that bitcoin is lost but if the owner of that bitcoin were motivated, what percentage of those do we think is reasonable to assume could be recovered?,"" said Chris, a 50-year-old computer programmer who started his business in 2017 and, after some time retooling, ramped up operations late last year when his son came on board.

Nakamoto's forum

To find a sample of lost bitcoin for their analysis, Chris said they turned to a thread on BitcoinTalk, a forum whose creation is credited to bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. A thread started in 2011 called ""Let's add up the KNOWN lost bitcoins"" is filled with posts by people with the amount of bitcoin they lost and how it happened. The Brookses filtered and set parameters on the information, such as excluding losses of less than half of a bitcoin, to make an estimate on the sample population of the bitcoin reported lost.

The Brookses narrowed it all down to 72 posts that described the loss of at least half of a bitcoin. They determined that 14% are potentially recoverable cases and that from their own work in recovering wallets for clients, they can decrypt about 35% of passwords. That led to their conclusion that about 2.45% of lost bitcoin is retrievable. With a range between 68,110 and 92,855 bitcoins, that would make up to $4.7 billion in bitcoin recoverable based on the asset's price of about $50,372 on Friday.

Good guesses

""We get as good a list of passwords as we can from a client and then we put our heads together and spend some time extrapolating the way that they make their passwords and try to get in their mind when they are actually creating a password,"" said Charlie. ""That's the most helpful thing, just seeing their practice,"" he said. ""That's the cornerstone of our business, essentially.""

The duo will run ""hundreds of millions or billions of variations"" of password patterns and test those against the encrypted version of the wallet, said Chris.

""If you don't have a very good [password] guess, there are more possible passwords than there are atoms in the universe, and I'm not being facetious when I say that,"" Chris said.

The Brookses said decrypting times vary but occasionally can take as little as five seconds. That happened with a client whose list of nine potential passwords contained the correct one. Charlie said they worked for roughly a month and a half with the client who turned out to have about $250,000 in his wallet.

Security measures they take include having clients sign a contract stating they are the owner of the blockchain wallet being worked on. The two get paid on a sliding scale. Starting with wallets containing between zero and 10 bitcoins, or an equivalent value, the team will earn a 20% commission. There's no charge to clients if they can't recover any funds.

Chris said a number of their clients live in countries where people are largely unbanked.

""They may have a wallet with a couple of hundreds of dollars in it and that is their life savings. If they lose the password to it, they have no access to it anymore,"" said Chris. ""In some sense, it can be a heartbreaking piece of the business … we do crack some of [the wallets]. It's a balancing act to be helpful without going too far down a rabbit hole.""","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/6131ff9dee41b9001972273f?format=jpeg',)",none

The Cardano blockchain's ada token, the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko, hit an all-time high Thursday of $3.09, after breaking past $3 on Wednesday.

The surge in demand for the altcoin comes amid renewed interest in NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and continued enthusiasm for DeFi, or decentralized finance.

Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon said recently that she has bought her first Ethereum coin. This was followed by yet another celebrity, the socialite-entrepreneur Paris Hilton, who shared her love for Bitcoin on Twitter. Ethereum and Bitcoin are the two top cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalisation.

Witherspoon, however, did not disclose the amount she invested in Ethereum. As of September 4 (3:50pm IST), Ether price in India stood at Rs. 2.99 lakhs.

Just bought my first ETH! Let's do this #cryptotwitter — Reese Witherspoon (@ReeseW) September 2, 2021

Announcing her “love” for Bitcoin, Hilton shared a tweet by Michael Saylor, the largest corporate backer of the cryptocurrency. Saylor's post read, “Diamonds may be your best friend, but Bitcoin is forever.” As of September 4 (3:50pm IST), Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 38.23 lakhs.

The tweets have arrived as cryptocurrency prices leave behind the market crash it suffered in May, when most digital coins lost a huge chunk of their value, and appeared poised to rally again. Some coins are already showing signs of their determination. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin was trading above $50,000 (roughly Rs. 37 lakhs) on September 4, a gain of nearly $12,000 (roughly Rs. 9 lakhs) from a month ago. Similarly, Ethereum has gained more than $1,400 (roughly Rs. 1 lakh) since August 5.

Many people welcomed the two celebrities into the crypto world. Among them was YouTuber Logan Paul, who offered Witherspoon an NFT from the World of Women collection.

welcome to the club Reese ???????? DM me your Eth address, I'd love to gift you this @WorldOfWomenNFT because y'all could be related. And it'd be badass for your first NFT project pic.twitter.com/epA0EZQdXG — Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) September 3, 2021

Hilton has for some time highlighted her support for Bitcoin. She had previously welcomed NFL legend Tom Brady “to the team” after he changed his profile picture to include laser eyes. The laser eyes mean that the person donning the look is 'laser-focussed' on seeing Bitcoin price reach the $100,000 (roughly Rs. 73 lakhs) mark.

References to the feature were found by a developer named Alessandro Paluzzi, who said that “Twitter is working to allow you to add your Bitcoin and Ethereum address to your profile to receive tips via Tip Jar feature."" This, if and when rolled out, will be an update to the Tip Jar feature that was announced earlier this year.

Paluzzi shared on his Twitter a screenshot showing how users will be notified about being able to receive tips in cryptocurrency via the social media platform. While reports suggest that Twitter is using Strike’s services to generate Bitcoin invoices through the Lightning Network, Paluzzi says that it is not necessary to link a Strike account to add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to your profile. Following Paluzzi’s finding, Twitter’s product lead Kayvon Beykpour confirmed that the company is, indeed working on such a feature. Beykpour retweeted Paluzzi’s initial tweet, with a “soon"" emoji, hinting that the feature may come soon on the platform.

It is not clear as to how soon Twitter plans to roll out this feature for users. Given the trend, Twitter may initially roll out this feature for users in the United States only, as the adoption of cryptocurrencies is yet to reach or become mainstream in many regions.

Twitter recently rolled out the much-awaited Super Follow feature that allows creators and influencers on Twitter to charge their followers for exclusive content. This feature too, has started rolling out to users in US and Canada initially.

The new addition could be aimed to upgrade the Tip Jar feature that the microblogging network introduced earlier this year. Twitter is working on the ability to let users receive tips in Bitcoin through the Tip Jar feature. CEO Jack Dorsey in July suggested the implementation by calling Bitcoin a “big part” of the company's future in conversation with analysts and investors.

Mobile app developer Alessandro Paluzzi has found references about Twitter bringing the ability to let users add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their profiles. The developer posted a tweet that carried three screenshots to indicate the new options.

The first screenshot suggests that users would be able to copy Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to send tips in any of the two cryptocurrencies using the Tip Jar feature. In the second and third ones, Twitter appears to allow users to add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their profiles.

Alongside the screenshots suggesting the addition of Bitcoin and Ethereum address options, Paluzzi on Wednesday tweeted a screenshot to suggest the arrival of Bitcoin support to the Tip Jar feature. That tweet received a comment from Twitter's product lead Kayvon Beykpour that includes a lightning bolt emoji along with another saying “soon” to confirm its development and its imminent release.

Beykpour did not provide any further details about when exactly the ability to receive tips in Bitcoin through Tip Jar will be available to users. However, the screenshot posted by Paluzzi does suggest that Twitter would consider payment transfer technology The Lightning Network to allow tipping in Bitcoin on its platform.

The screenshot also suggested that Twitter would use Strike to generate Bitcoin Lightning invoices for the cryptocurrency tips users will get through the platform. Paluzzi on his newer tweet, though, says that users will not be required to link a Strike account for adding their Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses.

A report by MacRumor says that the work for Bitcoin tips has been suggested through Twitter for iOS beta code. It isn't available to beta testers at this moment, though.

In May, Twitter introduced its Tip Jar feature to let creators, journalists, and nonprofits monetise their tweets in the form of tips. The company initially enabled users to share links to their Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, Paypal, and Venmo accounts for receiving tips from their followers. That was, however, just the beginning as the platform appears to be adding cryptocurrencies as the new payment options.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has advocated cryptocurrencies for some time. In August, he said that Bitcoin would “unite a deeply divided country.” Dorsey during Twitter's earnings call in July also called the “big part” of Twitter's future.

“I think there's a lot of innovation above just currency to be had, especially as we think about decentralising social media more and providing more economic incentive,” he said while answering a question on how he sees Bitcoin becoming an integral part of Twitter.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/twitter_logo_main_pixabay_1620814744949.jpg',)",none
2021-09-04,Republic World,"Ethereum Competitor Solana Beats Dogecoin On Market Cap, Grows To $43 Billion",https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/other-tech-news/ethereum-competitor-solana-beats-dogecoin-on-market-cap-grows-to-43-dollars-billion.html,"Riding on the Ethereum surge, Solana (SOL) has now overtaken Dogecoin to become the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market valuation. SOL’s recent price rally saw it flip the crypto market’s valuation charts and put itself on to its new position with a market cap of around $43 billion. Solana recently ‘exploded’ and has been on the rise ever since. SOL has once again jumped over 25% in the last 24 hours to hit a new all-time high.

Solana surpasses Dogecoin on market cap

SOL, which was termed the ‘Ethereum killer’ by investors along with Cardano (ADA), has been the latest on the cryptocurrency bandwagon to mark a significant rise within days. The platform deals with blockchain-based smart contracts and the demand for the same has been on the rise lately. Ever since Ethereum’s recent update last month, Solana stacked explosive gains and climbed up the crypto market ranks.

Solana is now trading at around $150 and its market cap has grown by around $2 billion since Friday to reach $43 billion. Its closest competitor Dogecoin currently holds a market cap of $38.624 billion. SOL touched its all-time high in the last 24 hours and fell just off the mark as many investors began booking profit. However, the token seems to be on the rise back now.

Why is the Solana price surging?

It is a fact that all cryptocurrencies have been performing well in the market lately, but Solana has been the best of them. The “so-called” Ethereum Killer is indeed out-performing its competitors and is probably on the way to live up to its nickname. SOL is currently trading at $150, having rallied from $70 two weeks ago. It is no secret that Solana is currently the fastest cryptocurrency in the market, and its features keep getting improved by the makers.

Solana was founded in 2017 and deals on the Ethereum platform. Soon, Cardano (ADA) joined the race. Like the Ethereum and ADA, SOL supports smart contracts and is gaining popularity with developers building DeFi apps and creating NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

Among the three, Solana is the fastest by supporting nearly 70,000 transactions per second and that too at a meagre price. SOL, on its current trajectory, could even cross $175 in the coming months. Ethereum’s recent surge to cross the $4000 mark, since its big crash early this year, has played a major role in Solana’s rise.

The second-biggest cryptocurrency rose as high as $4,027 (roughly Rs. 2,93,900) on Friday before paring gains. It was at $3,914 (roughly Rs. 2,85,700) as of 12:06pm on Saturday in Hong Kong, trading at levels only reached previously in May. Ether has gained more than 50 percent since the end of July, with the Ethereum network's London upgrade early last month reducing supply increases.

As of September 4 (12:12pm IST), Ether price in India stood at Rs. 3.502 lakhs.

“Since the EIP-1559 upgrade one month ago, over 180,000 $ETH (equal to over $700 million or roughly Rs. 5,109 crores at current market prices) have been burned, resulting in continued disinflationary pressure on the Ethereum supply,” the Fundstrat crypto team wrote in a note Friday.

Ether has also done well amid continued interest in decentralised finance or DeFi, and NFTs – much of which use the Ethereum network. NFTs in particular have surged, with sales on major marketplace OpenSea rising more than 10-fold in August from the prior month.

Numerous cryptocurrencies have been performing well. Solana – now the seventh-biggest cryptocurrency – is up 68 percent in the past seven days and Polkadot has risen 27 percent, according to Coingecko.com. The overall crypto market cap is $2.36 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,72,26,737 crores), after bottoming at $1.24 trillion (roughly Rs. 90,51,336 crores) on July 20, CoinGecko data show.

“The breakout in Ethereum continued overnight, to levels last seen in May of this year, and cascaded into Cardano, Ripple and Polkadot,” said Martha Reyes-Hulme, head of research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange Bequant, in a note Friday.

Bitcoin hasn't seen the gains of its smaller peers, though it counted a success of its own recently by breaking through $50,000 (roughly Rs. 36,49,700 crores) again on Thursday. It's been holding near the level since, after spending more than a week sitting just under the key round-number level.

“Hold $50,000 and I expect Bitcoin to have another leg up to $60,000 (roughly Rs. 43,79,700) and test the April highs,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo. But Bitcoin “needs to start closing above $50,000 (roughly Rs. 36,49,700) and settle in the early 50s to temper concerns that this is a double top and we're heading down to $30,000 (roughly Rs. 21,89,800) again,” he said.

2021-09-04,Bitcoin News,Law Project Establishes Period to Decide Cryptocurrency Regulations in Brazil – Regulation Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/law-project-establishes-period-to-decide-cryptocurrency-regulations-in-brazil/,"Law Project Establishes Period to Decide Cryptocurrency Regulations in Brazil

A law project introduced in June in the National Congress of Brazil has jumped into the spotlight recently because it establishes a fixed period for the executive to start regulating cryptocurrency transactions. If approved, the proposal will establish the payment of taxes for cryptocurrency-based transactions. The project is being reviewed by the Chamber of Deputies and will have to be analyzed conclusively by the Finance and Taxation Committee.

Cryptocurrency Transactions to Be Regulated in Brazil

A law project proposal, Bill 2140/21, that was introduced to the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil in June, is now in the spotlight because it establishes a fixed period for the regulation of cryptocurrency transactions for the executive branch of the government. If approved, it would give a time limit of 180 days to devise all the necessary structures to regulate cryptocurrency transactions in an effective way. The project was presented by the deputy Alexandre Frota, part of the Partido de la Social Democracia Brasileña (PSDB).

Frota states that the absence of clear regulation for cryptocurrencies puts investors and the traditional financial system at risk, as crypto can aid in getting funds out of the country with no supervision. Frota declared:

With private and public banks, it is necessary to have rigorous regulation and inspection so that the population will not be deceived with promises of high individual profits, which has already happened to a great extent.

Brazil has been a country known for its crime associated with crypto-related scams in the last few years. The state has been fast to act when it comes to stopping these schemes, organizing several operations to shut down and arrest those responsible for illegal cryptocurrency-related activity over the last few months.

Taxes Could Be Coming

Another important part of the project states that operations carried out abroad must be scrutinized according to the same rules applied to banks, including taxation norms. However, it is still unclear how this might be carried out, due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions. This issue is currently being tackled by a special committee of the Chamber of Deputies.

However, Brazil is very much open to the issuance of a central bank digital currency. The Central Bank of Brazil is researching the creation of a Digital Real and debating if there is really a demand for such an instrument from the Brazilian population.

The tax department and investors are in a quandary over how to calculate gains on cryptocurrency. The draft bill tries to answer that. It will define cryptocurrency and will spell out what is allowed and what is not. Sachin Dave with exclusive details. Watch.

The Indian government and Indians have always been into savings. Unlike the westerners, India has high family values. The blood relations and family members are always there to support each other - also financially.The bread earner of the family saves for the future of the child(ren). In India, it is never like working for 40 hours a week, being paid as per the hours and chilling on the weekend and being broke by Monday morning. India's tradition of investment is a long term game that considers generations ahead.The Indian government realised this soon after independence and hence created a lot of schemes that come as retirement plans. The banks that come under the Reserve bank of India also come up with policies and plans to facilitate their customers into long term planning that involves minimum risk and a decent investment.Indians have been diverse in terms of their culture. But, the one thing that binds every Indian is the love for gold and silver . And again, traditionally speaking, gold is the symbol of Laxmi, the goddess of wealth. Gold is gifted to the bride and groom during the marriage. Gold is also worn as a piece of jewellery. Financially speaking, it is holding an asset that can be used in thick and thin for generations ahead.Another very popular financial instrument that Indians invest in is the FD or the fixed deposit. But with the new advancement of digital currency, will an average Indian adopt crypto? Let us see the differences and similarities.When you invest in FD, there are different sections under which you can invest your money in. For this investment that you declare, the government is notified of your strategy and you might get some consideration under tax benefit. On the other hand, the Indian government is not a too crypto pro, and hence, there is no tax exemption on the profits you make from investing in crypto.Government-supported: For creating an FD account with your bank, the steps are quite easy. A loaded bank account is good to go to create an FD account. While on the other hand, crypto investment requires you to create an account with a trading platform, that, in a normal case, is not encouraged by any government.As per the policy chosen by you, your bank and your tenure of FD, you are bound to get a fixed return. This usually does not change. Even if it does, it does not change too frequently. Also, the change in the percentage of return is not too much to give a shock to the investor. On the other hand, crypto rides a roller coaster. One moment the returns are doubled and the next moment you lose half of the money you invested. The frequency of change and the magnitude of change is humongous.FDs are long term plans and the entry and exit points are generally continuous till maturity. People generally do not exit their FD plan before it matures. No transaction happens and hence there is no transaction cost. On the contrary, since the crypto market is volatile, people make quick decisions. They enter, stay for some time, exit and then come back when the prices hit deep low. The number of entry and exit points is way too many and this incurs a lot of transactional costs.No need for any trading or exchange platform: For starting an FD account, you just need a bank account. And, having a bank account has been encouraged by the PM Jan Dhan Yojna. For investing in crypto, the user needs to have a verified account with a trading platform, link the bank account and then start to invest.FDs are an investment that people do not touch. People either start an FD for their retirement or they let it mature. The investment of crypto is not untouched. The amount ascertained for the investment in the crypto is every easily moved and circulated for investing in other cryptos or to encash into the local currency.FDs are long term plans. So is the crypto investment. But only pro-crypto investors understand this and are unshakable. Hence, even though both FD and cryptos are long term investment vehicles, many use the latter for short term gain.FDs are not rare. Do you want to open an account? Great! Go ahead. Do you want to mine bitcoin after 2140? Sorry, you cannot. Crypto comes with a finite supply and hence are rare. FDs are run on traditional money and we can have any number of traditional money notes as we want.This supports the above point. There is no mining or extra effort to convert your traditional money to be invested in FD. For cryptos, you need to mine new tokens to maintain their circulation or someone mines and sells them so that others can invest in them.FDs are the most secure, least risk involving financial planning method. Once you deposit money, you can forget it till it matures. Cryptos occupy the investors' time and attention. You lose your focus, you might lose a lot!As the inflation rate is higher, traditional instruments like FDs and RDs don't provide great relief. Even though crypto gets your heart beat faster, a person with good research on crypto can enter the market, stay for the time, make amazing money and exit intelligently. He/she doesn't wait for the 5-year tenure to get over.Indians love to invest money in the first place, love to invest for the long term and want their money to grow. While some people are risk-takers, some are more traditional. Investment strategies are like food choices. It depends from individual to individual. One that works for you might not work for your friend. Hence, it is always advisable to understand one's needs and wants and decide what best fits their goal.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85920307,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58030,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-09-04,NDTV.com,What Is A Cryptocurrency Exchange? How To Start Trading In It?,https://www.ndtv.com/business/cryptocurrency-exchange-how-do-cryptocurrency-exchanges-work-2527631,"For new investors, cryptocurrency is the buzzword. As much as it is promising in terms of giving returns over a short time, it is also volatile and risky. The whole idea of cryptocurrency is based on a distributed ledger that stores information on every transaction or trade. Also, the trade is protected by high-grade cryptography. The simplest way of investing in cryptocurrency is by trading (buying and selling) of any crypto coin like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Cadence, etc. These are done through online exchanges where investors open an account and start the trade.

What Is A Cryptocurrency Exchange?

These platforms facilitate cryptocurrency trading in exchange for digital and fiat currencies. They act as an intermediary between a buyer and a seller and charge a commission or transaction fee. CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber, and UnoCoin are some examples of online exchanges operating in India. An investor can also use an online exchange to convert their crypto coins back into fiat currency (Indian Rupee or US Dollar) for withdrawing the amount from their bank account later.

How Does It Work?

A cryptocurrency exchange acts like an intermediary – a brokerage firm – between a buyer and a seller of cryptocurrency. It allows a buyer to deposit money using several methods like direct bank transfer, UPI, using debit or credit cards, etc. It charges a set commission or fee for every transaction done using its services.

The first thing a buyer (or investor) will need to do is to find the right online exchange. This step will require a fair bit of research about the platform's history, credibility, and what benefits it will offer you for trading. The next step is opening a trading account, which is fairly simple.

Download an app of the exchange you have selected and create an account. It will ask you for some information like your email address. It will then send a verification email to that address and may also ask for KYC details. Verify the address on your email id and complete the KYC process. Then set a password on the app and you are set to launch yourself in the world of cryptocurrency.

Do not lose any passwords related to the app, wallet, or exchange. They may not be recovered.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/ogfsfjs8_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-09-04,,"Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to Buy this Weekend, September 2021",https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-cryptocurrencies-to-buy-this-weekend-september-2021/,"Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to Buy this Weekend, September 2021

Here are the best cryptocurrencies to buy and invest in.

At this point, there isn’t anyone who has not heard of cryptocurrencies. From this year’s biggest cryptocurrency crash due to China’s ban to Elon Musk’s controversial tweets and companies accepting Bitcoin as payments, as each day passes, we are seeing the hype around cryptocurrencies grow in real-time.

While Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto sector, other promising altcoins are also making headlines as they are becoming investor favorites. So obviously, Bitcoin is not the only crypto option to invest in. So if you are planning on buying cryptocurrencies this weekend, to start off your crypto journey, here are the 10 best stocks you should consider.

1. Bitcoin

In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin is equivalent to gold. From retail investors to prominent businessmen, everyone is putting their trust in Bitcoins. After the massive market crash in April 2021 that led to Bitcoin trading at US$30,000, the digital coin has bounced back to trade at US$50,000. The main reason behind the value is scarcity. Only 21 million Bitcoins exist and out of that, about 19 million have already been mined.

2. Ethereum

Second to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the silver of the cryptocurrency market. Thanks to Ethereum’s network that supports DeFi, a lot of cryptocurrencies have innovated the “smart contract” concept. This utility feature has made Etherum the second-highest valued cryptocurrency in the market according to its market cap US$441.13 billion.

3. Cardano

There’s something about Cardano that attracts several experienced investors. Cardano was created as a “third-generation cryptocurrency” that can solve common crypto problems like scalability and security. While other cryptos borrowed codes from existing projects, Cardano was built from code by code. Its network can handle smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and anything else that exists in the crypto world.

4. Polkadot

Polkadot is a recently-launched cryptocurrency that got famous quickly. Polkadot was created with an intention to use the “proof of stake” network verification system which is touted as a better system than the “proof of work” that Bitcoin and Etherum uses. Polkadot can process multiple transactions which makes it scalable. The versatility of this network allows it to be used for smart contracts, file storage chains, and IoT chains to allow device-to-device communication.

5. XRP

XRP, made by Ripple Labs, aims to create a fast and secure payment system that works globally. One of the most reliable cryptocurrencies, it has a huge loyal investor base. According to the company, many financial institutions prefer this cryptos RippleNet service which uses the XRP crypto coins. XRP’s payment system has the capability to compete with legacy systems like SWIFT and convert crypto to any fiat currency.

6. Uniswap

Uniswap is a platform that has its own reward token called the UNI that works on the Ethereum network. The USP of these tokens is the fact that they can be exchanged among crypto users without trading them on centralized crypto exchanges like Binance. The USP is a hit as traders have been using the tokens, making it the best DeFi token by market cap.

7. Chainlink

Chainlink has a loft ambition for itself in the cryptocurrency market. Its purpose is to make a decentralized oracle network that can serve as a middleman between smart contracts and data sources. Basically, it makes smart contracts trustworthy by providing a secure, reliable link. It’s also a core part of the DeFi system. Due to its utility, The World Economic Forum named Chainlink one of the 100 most promising tech pioneers of 2020.

8. Stellar

The idea of cryptocurrencies is to simplify payments and Stellar’s mission aligns with that, to simplify cross-currency transfers. For that, this crypto network has partnered with International Business Machine Inc to create IBM World Wire. This collaboration enables fast currency transfer services to financial institutions across the world.

9. Dogecoin

Elon Musk’s tweets revived this meme coin that was supposed to be forgotten by the world. Dogecoin didn’t have any purpose until billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of Dallas Mavericks, decided that the NBA team would accept Dogecoin as payment. Such celebrity incidents now made Dogecoin one of the most anticipated cryptos.

10. Aave

Aave’s purpose is to complete the lack of borrowing and lending applications on Ether’s network. For this utility, Aave has now become a DeFi pioneer. This crypto has nearly US$5 billion worth of locked assets, which amounts to a third of the total market.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Top-10-Cryptocurrencies-to-Buy-this-Weekend-September-2021.jpg',)",none

2021-09-04,Bitcoin News,Japan's Financial Giant SBI to Launch Cryptocurrency Fund – Finance Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/japans-financial-giant-sbi-cryptocurrency-fund/,"Japan's Financial Giant SBI to Launch Cryptocurrency Fund

Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings is reportedly launching a crypto fund that will invest in several cryptocurrencies. “I want people to hold it together with other assets and experience firsthand how useful it can be for diversifying portfolios,” said an executive of the company.

SBI Holdings Launching Crypto Fund

SBI Holdings Inc. has revealed its plan to launch a cryptocurrency fund by the end of November, Bloomberg reported Thursday, calling it the country’s first crypto fund.

Tomoya Asakura, director of SBI Asset Management and president of SBI affiliate Morningstar Japan, explained that the fund will invest in a number of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, and litecoin.

He added that the fund is aimed at customers who understand the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including their high volatility. In addition, there may be a minimum investment of about one million yen ($9,122) to three million yen.

Asakura noted in a recent interview that if the first fund “goes very well,” then the firm would like to “move quickly” to launch a second fund. He opined:

I want people to hold it together with other assets and experience firsthand how useful it can be for diversifying portfolios.

SBI is also considering launching another fund specifically tailored to institutional investors if there is enough demand for the product, the executive noted.

Due to strict crypto regulations following hacking incidents at exchanges in Japan, it has taken SBI four years to get its crypto fund off the ground, the publication conveyed. It added that the company had to change its plan of how the fund is offered to investors to comply with regulations.

SBI initially planned to launch its crypto fund as an investment trust, a popular investing method in Japan. However, the country’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), banned companies from selling crypto investments using this method. The company then changed its plan and will offer its crypto fund to investors using a vehicle known as an “anonymous partnership.”

Asakura noted that “There is an overwhelming perception that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and speculative.” He plans to build a track record to show the public and regulators that cryptocurrencies can help investors diversify their portfolios.

2021-09-04,US News Money,How Blockchain Can Transform the Financial Services Industry,https://money.usnews.com/investing/cryptocurrency/articles/how-blockchain-can-transform-the-financial-services-industry,"Blockchain has the potential to make the financial services industry more transparent, less susceptible to fraud and cheaper for consumers. (Getty Images)

Blockchain technology is one of the leading innovations in the finance industry, holding promise to reduce fraud, ensure quick and secure transactions and trades, and ultimately help manage risk within the interconnected global financial system.

Blockchain accomplishes this through advanced cryptography that is designed to be resistant to hacking, adding trust to the transaction ecosystem.

There are many financial uses provided by blockchain, not limited to keeping track of transactions and trades. As our global financial system becomes more connected in our age of digital transformation, investors would be well advised to learn about how blockchain is changing the system and how to gain and regulate exposure to this development.

Here's what investors should know about blockchain's growing role in financial services and the earning potential and risk factors it poses, from tech-oriented startups to traditional banks:

What is blockchain?

Benefits of blockchain in financial services

Risks that blockchain and financial institutions face

Blockchain investments to buy

What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a digital collection of transactions that are tracked and recorded in a decentralized network. It is a distributed ledger, which means there is no central authority of the network, or no one person or entity in control with the ability to corrupt the network. The blockchain comprises individual blocks of data, each containing a record of information, that are linked together in chronological order. These links cannot be changed, which is what instills confidence in the network.

This revolutionary technology manages transactions of information by securing them as they occur. The purpose of blockchain is to lower the cost of transactions and make them more efficient and faster.

The technology has many applications that can be integrated into different industries, providing investors with many opportunities. For starters, it's one of the technological underpinnings of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

One industry with clear applications for the blockchain is financial services, where companies are in a perpetual race to reduce the costs and friction of transactions.

Benefits of Blockchain in Financial Services

Blockchain has the potential to make the financial services industry more transparent, less susceptible to fraud and cheaper for consumers.

Improving transparency. Blockchain can make the financial industry more transparent since users are performing activities on a public ledger. This transparency can expose inefficiencies like fraud, leading to problem-solving that could reduce risk for financial institutions.

Adding security. As consumers become increasingly active online, the digital universe is a breeding ground for scammers. With blockchain technology, this concern could be reduced. Payments and money transfers made on the blockchain are faster and more traceable than in traditional banking.

When information flows through different financial intermediaries, there is a risk of interception of that information, raising the possibility of fraud. This hole in oversight can be filled with blockchain's cryptographic algorithms that bring security in the exchange of information between parties.

""In traditional finance, clean audit trails can be difficult to procure at times, which have led to severe economic losses in the past due to negligent behavior or malicious actors,"" says Ben Samaroo, co-founder and CEO at WonderFi, a decentralized finance platform. ""This risk can be significantly reduced with a combination of blockchain technology and machine learning to monitor and manage risks with a high degree of precision.""

Financial technology companies other businesses that use large amounts of data need blockchain to build data integrity.

""Since the blockchain network is distributed, it doesn't have a single source of failure,"" says Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer at Gate Technology, a cryptocurrency exchange based in China.

This characteristic, Tatibouet says, increases the network's resilience, protecting it from compromise.

Lowering costs. As investors move away from financial advisors to avoid higher fees, blockchain provides an opportunity for consumers to benefit from lower costs associated with traditional financial services.

Financial technology companies have become a huge part of the financial services industry, allowing investors to open accounts with digital advisors and make independent financial decisions. As fintech plays a stronger role in global finance, its relationship with blockchain will inevitably become stronger.

This innovation can be good for consumers because investors are getting more for their money and they're getting a balance between automation of financial services and a lower cost.

""The institutions that adopt this new technology first will be able to streamline internal processes and provide their customers with lower-cost financial services, effectively beating their competitors on cost to capture a larger portion of the market,"" Samaroo says.

This ultimately benefits the everyday investor who's looking to cut expenses while accessing this new financial services environment.

Risks that Blockchain and Financial Institutions Face

Weighing against the promise blockchain holds for financial institutions is one major risk affecting the bottom line: Traditional financial institutions make money on transaction fees that could be lowered or eliminated with blockchain technology.

When it comes to transferring money, consumers have to rely on banks or third parties to process transactions.

But adoption of blockchain could bypass third parties such as banks, which would eliminate fees and other costs associated with these services. As a result, banks may face challenges in volume and transaction-based revenue.

Blockchain makes the infrastructure that's proprietary to financial institutions less important because it serves as a verification mechanism that's ""not concentrated in the power of one institution,"" says Thomas Shohfi, assistant professor in the Lally School of Management at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.

In addition, blockchain innovation is moving so fast that regulation hasn't caught up yet. So the potential policies impacting blockchain can be seen as another obstacle in incorporating blockchain in financial services.

""Existing regulation does present a significant obstacle for blockchain adoption since regulators will prioritize existing incumbents over disruptors,"" Tatibouet says.

Regulators are working through determining the pros and cons of blockchain technology to see if it's suitable for financial institutions and what the consequences are for companies and consumers.

""This rigidity has stifled innovation so far,"" Tatibouet says. ""However, this view is changing as governments and other public organizations are seeing the benefits of this technology.""

Blockchain Investments to Buy

For investors who want exposure to blockchain as it changes the financial services industry, there are a few ways to approach this investment. One way is to buy into companies whose businesses are tapped into blockchain technology.

""Financial companies or technology companies that see blockchain as a disruptive technology and want to be experts in it can sell their services to customers,"" Shohfi says.

A company that falls in this category is International Business Machines Corp. (ticker: IBM), which is focused on the development of blockchain technologies. IBM also provides services for businesses to integrate blockchain for efficiency, scalability and growth.

Another approach investors can take is investing in cryptocurrency-oriented stocks that serve as a pure play for blockchain investments. MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) fits the bill here. The software solutions company holds more than 105,000 bitcoins, a portfolio valued at more than $5 billion.

Square Inc. (SQ) is another company that's heavily invested in Bitcoin and strongly believes in the blockchain network. The payment services company recently announced that it will launch a decentralized finance platform with a focus on Bitcoin applications.

Investors are taking notice of these stocks and their potential. MicroStrategy is up about 80% year to date, and Square has seen a year-to-date rise of 23%. That's compared with the S&P 500's year-to-date return of about 20%. Investing in these publicly traded companies allows you to broadly invest in the blockchain without having direct exposure to the volatility and speculation associated with some cryptocurrencies.","('https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/89cc057/2147483647/crop/2096x1398%2B0%2B0/resize/970x647/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fa0%2F4c%2F5d53326d407b99b8a971d0a33326%2F210903-stock.jpg',)",none
2021-09-04,The Motley Fool,"Why Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum -- and Coinbase, Too -- Are Moving Today",https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/03/why-bitcoin-dogecoin-ethereum-coinbase-moved/,"What happened

As the week draws to a close, cryptocurrency prices are looking decidedly mixed in Friday morning trading. Here's how prices for several of the biggest names in cryptocurrency stand as of 10:10 a.m. EDT:

Crypto industry bellwether Bitcoin CRYPTO:BTC)

Trader darling Dogecoin CRYPTO:DOGE)

Ethereum CRYPTO:ETH)

And for that matter, crypto marketplace Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is up as well -- 2.2%.

So what

Meanwhile, the headlines on cryptocurrencies look just as mixed.

As Coindesk reports this morning, China -- whose crackdown on cryptocurrencies sparked a panic and crashed crypto prices early in the summer -- appears to be done wielding the hammer. China ""has completed rectification"" of the crypto market, reports Coinbase, and now that most crypto mining hubs in the country have been shut down, and the government has told financial institutions to refrain from ""conducting or enabling virtual currency transactions and trading,"" no further regulations on cryptocurrencies are anticipated.

Granted, the regulations already passed appear to have basically removed the world's most populous nation from the cryptocurrency market, which won't be good for growth trends. But at the very least, China doesn't seem to be planning to wreak any further havoc on the market -- and so crypto investors can heave a sigh of relief on that score.

And there's further news today from the world's second most populous nation. As India's The Economic Times reports, Indian legislators are hard at work on a new bill that will break cryptocurrencies into one of three categories: those used for investment, for payments, or serving as a form of ""utility."" The bill will also, if it becomes law, classify all cryptocurrencies as a form of commodity asset.

Now what

Is this good news or bad news? Well, when you consider that barely a week ago, The Economic Times was wondering aloud whether the Indian government might ban cryptocurrencies entirely, the fact that now the government just wants to regulate and even institutionalize crypto has to be seen as a positive.

I'd even go so far as to say that, even with India's bill not yet passed into law, the change in sentiment here is a good one for cryptocurrency investors. In India as in the U.S., while crypto traders might buck at the idea of government interfering with their fun, well-thought-out regulations have the potential to cut down on fraud and abuse that might scare serious investors away from investing in cryptocurrency. Regulation has the potential, too, to calm price swings and volatility in this market, transforming crypto into more of an investment and less of a speculation.

If you ask me, that's a good thing -- and a reason for crypto prices to rise.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/641943/red-arrow-going-down-crosses-a-green-arrow-going-up.jpg',)",none

In so doing, Ether broke out of its three-month trading zone, with $4,025 just $350 away from all-time highs.

In terms of weekly performance, Ether took third place out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, behind Solana's SOL and Polkadot's DOT tokens.

Bitcoin (BTC) also capitalized on fresh strength of its own, rallying to a critical resistance at $51,000.

How long can the good times last?

Ether's successes have given bulls reason to rejoice, but the move has also produced some murmurs from critics.

With gas fees still causing frustration for traders, there was a sense of disparity as even actress Reese Witherspoon announced that she had invested in Ether.

Broadly, however, opinions converged that the final months of 2021 may mimick the rush to the finish of 2013 and 2017.

""Regardless of when exactly it comes the next few months will probably be insane beyond what most of you can imagine, but also one day during all that mania the music will stop,"" popular Twitter account Lark Davis summarized in a dedicated thread on the current crypto bull market.

The move is likely to benefit Indian cryptocurrency investors who have been waiting for a concrete law to regulate virtual coin trading.

Cryptocurrencies could be defined as commodities or assets in the new draft bill, reported The Economic Times after speaking to people aware of the development. The draft bill may also propose taxation for cryptocurrencies including laws for payments, investments and other utilities, added the report.

While the government had earlier said it would not go for an outright ban on cryptocurrencies, it has not yet provided any clarity on how it plans to deal with virtual coin trade in India.

However, cryptocurrencies may be categorised as per the technology they use in the new draft bill. But the primary focus of the government will be based on end-usage of the assets for regulatory purposes, according to the ET report.

TAX TREATMENT, OTHER RULES

The new draft bill is also expected to determine how taxes will be levied on cryptocurrency investments.

A person quoted in the ET report said the government’s draft crypto bill aims to define cryptocurrency and its treatment in various use cases. This will help authorities register cryptocurrency trade in the books of accounts and tax accordingly. However, the government may not be looking to allow payments and settlements through virtual currencies through its bill.

More clarity is needed on whether cryptocurrencies will be treated as commodities, services or similar to equities; only then can virtual coins be taxed or regulated. This is why the government’s primary goal is to define cryptocurrencies in its draft bill. Simply put, a clear definition of cryptocurrency is required to figure out how it will be regulated and taxed in future.

However, sources quoted in the ET report indicated that the government could apply something similar to security transaction tax (STT) on cryptocurrency trade. If they are categorised as commodities, the returns or gains made by investors could also be taxed as business income at normal income tax rates.

WHY CRYPTOCURRENCY BILL IS IMPORTANT

The development comes at a time when cryptocurrency trade is growing rapidly in the country. Domestic cryptocurrency exchanges have reported a sharp jump in trading volumes, and they have also requested the government to regulate virtual coin trade rather than imposing a ban.

Cryptocurrency exchanges in India have said numerous times that the country needs to recognise cryptocurrency tokens as digital assets rather than currencies, and subsequently, clarify policies related to crypto trade.

As of now, cryptocurrency does not have any legal status in India and are unregulated. The proposed crypto bill is likely to define the future of virtual coin trade in the country.

People in the know said only the cryptocurrencies that are covered under the government’s definition will be allowed to be traded in India.

This past weekend at the Market America Worldwide Shop.com 2021 International Convention (MAIC2021), the president of the e-commerce firm, Steve Ashley, announced Shop.com sites from around the world will be accepting cryptocurrencies via Bitpay. This means that bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, and several other digital assets can be used to purchase products via Shop.com’s websites.

Shop.com Now Accepts Digital Currencies via Bitpay

Shop.com is accepting cryptocurrencies via Bitpay, the largest crypto payment service provider in the world. Steve Ashley the president and COO of Shop.com announced “the use of cryptocurrency as the next chapter in purchasing products on all Shop.com sites.” Ashley revealed the crypto support at the Market America Worldwide Shop.com 2021 International Convention (MAIC2021).

“Today I’m announcing that Shop.com is going to be offering bitcoin, ethereum, and several other cryptocurrencies through Bitpay,” said Ashley. “We’re going to be offering this at Shop.com sites worldwide in all of our Market Countries,” Ashley added.

Shop.com is a fairly popular e-commerce web portal that’s ranked 26,133 worldwide and 191 against “E-commerce and shopping” websites, according to similarweb.com statistics. Shop.com is owned by Market America, a multi-level marketing (MLM) firm that was created in 1992. Market America purchased Shop.com for an undisclosed sum at the end of 2010. Market America also specializes in manufacturing a line of Isotonix it introduced to the public the year after the company started.

“Shop.com and Market America are such great brands,” Sonny Singh, Bitpay’s chief commercial officer said in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News. “What I really like about them as such a great fit is because of your international presence. The fact that you’re only doing 40% of your volume in America means it’s a really global brand,” Singh added. The Bitpay chief commercial officer continued:

In countries like Taiwan, Thailand, Argentina, Brazil, and Indonesia, it’s very hard to make payments. Credit cards are not everywhere and in those countries, Bitpay and crypto is the cheapest, quickest payment option to accept Bitcoin and to receive crypto payment options as well.

JR Ridinger, the founder and CEO of Market America, said that Shop.com, thanks to Steve Ashley’s leadership, continues to be a trendsetter. “As different online retailers scramble to create a plan of action to implement things like accepting cryptocurrency as a method of online payment, thanks to Steve Ashley – we’ve already done that,” Ridinger said.

When visiting the Shop.com website, the web portal displays a newly added message about the crypto acceptance. The message leads to a page that describes how Shop.com customers can leverage the Bitpay crypto payment system to pay for items. The website also details that Shop.com customers can “earn cashback on thousands of products with Bitpay.”

NEW DELHI: Will cryptocurrencies wreck the global warming targets and trigger an environmental disaster? This question has become the topic of heated debates between cryptocurrency advocates and those who want them banned.The first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 consume ginormous amounts of electricity when they are mined. Mining is the process by which new Bitcoins enter circulation and the ledger of transactions is maintained and validated.It requires sophisticated and powerful computers to solve cryptographic puzzles and has been built around the “proof of work” principle.Mining has been getting progressively more difficult and expensive over time because of the way the first crypto currency, Bitcoin, and the others that followed initially, were created.But how much energy does cryptocurrency mining actually consume? Estimates vary. The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF) had estimated that currently Bitcoin mining consumes around 110 Terawatt Hours per year.Others have put it even higher – at around 155 TWh or so. To put that in perspective, it is around 0.55 percent of global electricity production, or equal to what a country like Malaysia consumes annually.And that is just for Bitcoin mining. Add the others and you are looking at an even higher energy footprint.Critics point out that the CO2 and heat generated by crypto currency mining is far more than any gains that one gets from emission reductions of electric vehicles (EV) being used around the world.Bitcoin mining and that of other similar cryptocurrencies were particularly bad for the environment until even a couple of years ago because the miners primarily used power from plants using coal.Many of the crypto currency mining hubs were in China, and while some of them used the cleaner hydro power, a number of miners depended on thermal power plants too. At one point, over 60 percent of Bitcoin mining was taking place in China.But over the past year, China has cracked down on miners and most miners have started moving out. Also, increasingly miners have been relying on green and renewable energy rather than thermal power.Most miners are working in areas where energy is generated using solar, wind, hydro and even flared natural gas of oil wells. While these do not cut out emissions altogether, there has been a concerted effort by the crypto currency champions to utilise energy that is both cheap and has a lower carbon footprint.Meanwhile, newer crypto currencies are ensuring that they either use less power for mining or use a different method of validation called “proof of stake”, which does not require using the kind of power that proof of work crypto currencies require.Even Ethereum, the second oldest and second most popular crypto currency is coming out with version 2.0, which will drastically cut down its carbon footprint.The worry for cryptocurrency miners is that increasingly, countries will regulate mining or ban it altogether in order to meet the emission goals agreed upon. This is why the search of solutions is going on frenetically.Multiple suggestions ranging from introducing a new cryptocurrency that will be given to anyone who can submit proof of removing each ton of CO2 or other greenhouse gases to the development of new eco-friendly crypto currencies to a blockchain-based platform to track carbon emissions and reduction of crypto currency usage.One solution – the Crypto Climate Accord -- envisages a pact that will see the shifting of all crypto currency activities to clean fuels and become net zero carbon emission by 2040. The problem is that while it has supporters, many of the older and more popular cryptocurrencies have yet to sign up for it.The issue is that using green energy for cryptocurrency mining alone doesn’t solve the entire problem. Even when clean energy or renewable energy like solar is used, the sheer power needed by the computers generates enormous heat.Crypto mining also adds to the pile of electronic waste that needs to be disposed of. And the fact that cryptocurrency mining becomes more difficult and requires more computing power every year creates its own set of environmental hazards.Crypto advocates suggest that eventually a solution acceptable to all will be found. Apart from transiting to green energy, crypto miners will also play a role in grid balancing and flexible demand-response services.Over the next few years, we will know whether that works out as well as they expect. Meanwhile, environmental scientists plan to keep a close watch on the crypto mining industry.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85864245,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50952,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

In the past, China’s regulatory crackdown pushed the Bitcoin to touch an all -time low and also made the cryptocurrency market volatile, so much so that Bitcoin oscillated between highs and lows. Bitcoin touched a low of $28,000 in June and high of $75,000 in April. Also, the largest currency Bitcoin’s dominance witnessed an increase of 0.08 per cent and currently stands at 42.16 per cent. On the other hand, Ethereum, the viral currency of Bitcoin, was also trading in the green at $3,742.55, up 6.48 per cent. Amongst the basket of cryptocurrency, barring Tether, USD Coin, Binance USD were trading in the red on Thursday.

“BTC remained muted over the past few days, yet most of the Altcoins made significant bullish movements. However, it was a totally different story over the past 24 hours. We witnessed massive volatility where BTC moved significantly higher. It made the already pumped-up Altcoins move even higher. The largest Altcoin, Ether, made a huge jump from the day’s low of $3384 and moved closer to the $3800 mark. Most of the other top Altcoins replicated a similar move. The crypto fear and greed index is at 71 for the past couple of weeks, indicating a massive bullish momentum prevailing in the markets. The entire crypto market capitalization moved a massive 4 per cent higher over the previous day and stood close to $2.18 trillion. Traded volumes were significantly high, indicating the buying pressure across the spectrum,” Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder, Mudrex- A Global Crypto Trading Platform, said.

In the last two weeks, favourable developments in the world of cryptocurrency led to a sharp rally in the prices of cryptocurrency. After Raghuram Rajan, former RBI governor of India’s comment regarding cryptocurrency, on Wednesday, well known tennis player Naomi Osaka showed her interest in cryptocurrency. Yesterday, she took to Twitter and said, “I was actually just talking with my agent about cryptocurrencies,” Osaka said in an interview to Bloomberg. “I know that online, everything is getting bigger. I remember reading about Dogecoin … there’s going to be something new and interesting that’s going to pop up.” On Thursday, the global crypto market cap is $2.24 trillion, which is a 5.89 per cent increase over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $129.10 billion, which makes a 0.99 per cent decrease. The total volume in DeFi is currently $15.84 billion, 12.27 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins is now $97.60 billion, which is 75.61 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.

“Bitcoin is officially on track to become a legal tender in El Salvador in the coming days. (by September 7th). Customarily, any such major update is often met with resistance. Consequently, certain volatility is expected in the coming week. For the third time in a couple of weeks, Ethereum tried to break out of a bull flag pattern on the daily charts and met with rejection at the flag’s resistance. The bulls appear to be collectively ready to breach that resistance and would only be a matter of time unless Bitcoin drags the market downhill,” Siddharth Menon, COO WazirX said.

2021-09-02,News.com.au,"Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin soar in Australia",https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/experts-predict-cryptocurrency-will-dominate-financial-industry-by-2029/news-story/68340bb221ed9cbbb6e76507e3d6d521,"A report has revealed why cryptocurrency purchases are soaring among a particular generation of Australians, fuelling a bold prediction.

Cryptocurrency experts believe it will surpass traditional finance in Australia as early as 2029 after a new report revealed the country had accumulated $7bn worth of digital coins.

Comparison site Finder has released its annual Cryptocurrency Report with some significant revelations, including that 31 per cent of Gen Z Australians (born after 1997) own some form of crypto.

Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital forms of money that take on the form of tokens or “coins” using cryptography, making it difficult to be counterfeited.

Australians have amassed $7bn worth of cryptocurrency, with the average investor owning $2078 in assets.

Overall, 17 per cent of Australians own cryptocurrency, while a further 13 per cent said they intended to buy it within the next year.

A nationally representative Finder survey also found 56 per cent of Australians believed tech billionaire Elon Musk invented Bitcoin.

Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, owned by 9 per cent of Australian crypto investors, followed by Ethereum (8 per cent), Dogecoin (5 per cent) and Bitcoin Cash (4 per cent).

The biggest revelation out of Finder’s report is that almost 31 per cent of Gen Z Australians (aged 24 and under) own cryptocurrency, and that figure has more than doubled since January.

But ownership of digital coins has dropped in other generations.

Finder’s cryptocurrency expert James Edwards said Gen Z’s behaviour was a sign traditional finance was being phased out in a bold prediction for its future.

“Many Aussies are now much more clear on the benefits cryptocurrencies offer, such as Bitcoin being a hedge against fiat currency and inflation, plus the ability to earn interest on assets through things like stablecoins and decentralised finance on Ethereum,” he said.

Fred Schebesta says the growth in cryptocurrency will explode.

“If the pace of education continues to grow, combined with easier access to cryptocurrencies, we should expect to see it as a dominant financial industry by the end of the decade, especially among younger generations who have never had meaningful access to traditional finance.”

Finder founder Fred Schebesta also predicted digital coins were about to explode.

“As the technology develops and there are easier ways to access it – like in the Finder app where you can buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in a few clicks – I believe the growth in cryptocurrency will explode,” he said.

The report emphasised social media will underpin the growth of cryptocurrencies.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/80971fc577bc8a4140540022df38d45e',)",none

Cardano has doubled this month, becoming the third-largest digital asset. Binance Coin is also up. A token named Avalanche has tripled in August. Meanwhile, prices for digital photos of rocks with laser eyes and cartoon depictions of cute animals are going gangbusters, sometimes quadrupling in a matter of days.

Among analysts and investors, there’s little consensus as to what’s driving parts of the frenzy. Some posit that speculators are moving from the mainstays to newer, more exciting offshoots, as they often do after big runs. Others see a world awash in cash and ultra-low rates, which ultimately pushes investors toward ever-wonkier assets. A few tokens are backed by strong narratives, such as technological advances at the Cardano and Solana networks.

“There’s no doubt that there’s a lot of excitement in crypto,” said Yoni Assia, founder and chief executive of online exchange eToro. “You can definitely see it within the numbers in the industry, whether it’s looking at total volumes or looking at growth of companies,” he said, adding that “we’ve seen a lot of exuberance in the market.”





Assia calls it a “generational buying moment” and cites a confluence of events, including rock-bottom interest rates worldwide, as well as massive fiscal stimulus efforts that delivered checks to many people during the pandemic.

Some of that money has gone toward and related assets, such as stocks of digital miners. About 15% of Americans who received the first two stimulus checks invested part or all of the money, and about half of this group invested specifically in cryptocurrencies, according to a survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults conducted by The Harris Poll for Yahoo Finance.

At the same time, inflation has materialized as economies reopen, playing into the warnings from some crypto faithful of pending hyperinflation. Put all that together and it’s “leading a lot of people to look for various types of investments,” Assia said.

A recent survey by eToro found that roughly a quarter of the 6,000 investors queried own crypto, a number that increases to nearly 50% for the younger cohort. The company also found that the average investor was set to increase their crypto allocation in the coming months and that interest in alternatives to and Ether, or altcoins, is “significant.”

Meanwhile, downloads for crypto trading apps are rising -- Coinbase Global Inc. ranked 11th among finance apps in Apple’s iPhone downloads, according to App Annie, a mobile data and analytics provider. It averaged 23rd within its category last August. Digital exchanges Kraken, Voyager and Crypto.com have also advanced in the ranks.





“With all of this money floating around, we should not be surprised that there are people paying exorbitant amounts of money for digital pet rocks and an endless amount of other digital assets that can be easily created,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.

The space is dominated by younger generations, he said, and all they know is a Federal Reserve that’s been almost-perpetually accommodative. Take that, alongside a gridlocked government, and it’s no surprise many have gravitated toward the crypto space, he said.

Since July, assets under management for digital-asset investment products rose more than 57% to roughly $55 billion. Average daily aggregate trading volumes increased more than 46% to $544 million, the biggest month-over-month rise since May, according to data-tracker CryptoCompare.

A lot of the attention’s been placed on altcoins such as Cardano, Avalanche and the meme mainstay Dogecoin. Meantime, an index tracking some of the largest decentralized finance protocols and apps -- the Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index -- is up about 50% since the start of July.

“There’s generally been pretty positive crypto sentiment recently: NFTs have helped lead the revival, and the crash from May is further in the rearview mirror,” said Sam Bankman-Fried, chief executive officer of crypto exchange FTX.

And then there are the blockchains looking to compete with Ethereum. Avi Felman, co-portfolio manager at BlockTower Capital, said now that Ethereum’s recent network upgrade is done, speculators are turning their attention toward rival blockchains and their tokens.

Meanwhile, the U.S. equity markets seem to post records daily. Meme stocks are going bonkers too. Jason Urban, co-head of Galaxy Digital Trading, said when the market’s in a such a risk-on mood, crypto can only benefit.

In the four years ending in 2019, correlations between and daily returns for the S&P 500 were generally small, according to Wei Liang at DBS in Singapore. But starting last year, that changed. Amid the pandemic, Bitcoin and U.S. stocks have fallen and rebounded jointly, he said.

“Lately, you see people are concerned about inflation, people are concerned about money supply -- because of that, historically, people always said buy stocks as a hedge against inflation,” Urban said. Now, he added, it’s crypto as well.","('https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2021-08/31/full/1630353924-4152.jpg',)",none

In response to the speech, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell, the S&P 500 index rose to a new all-time high, and Bitcoin (BTC) surged about $1,500 in under an hour. This showed that market participants viewed the speech as “dovish.”

Bitcoin’s uncertainty near the $50,000 mark has analysts divided about its short-term directional move. Analyst Ryan Clark believes the current consolidation in Bitcoin is similar to the one seen below $24,000 before the breakout in December 2020, but TraderXO believes that BTC may correct to the $39,000 to $42,000 zone in September.

Will Bitcoin’s consolidation below $50,000 attract buying in altcoins? Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the next few days.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin bounced off the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), calculated at $46,823, on Aug. 27, but the bulls have not been able to push the price above the overhead resistance zone at $50,000 to $50,500. This suggests that bears have not thrown in the towel yet.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price turns down from the current level and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the short-term traders are booking profits. That may pull the price down to $43,927 and then to $42,451.

If the price rebounds off this support, the BTC/USDT pair may remain range-bound between $42,451 and $50,500 for a few more days.

Alternatively, if the price turns up from the current level or bounces off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the overhead zone. If they manage to do that, the pair may start its journey toward $60,000.

The moving averages on the four-hour chart have flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is close to the midpoint, indicating a range-bound action in the near term. The price may remain stuck between $46,200 and $49,500 for some time.

If bulls drive the price above $49,500, the pair may challenge the $50,500 resistance. A breakout and close above this level could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. On the contrary, if bears sink the price below $46,200, the pair may drop to $44,000.

ADA/USDT

Cardano (ADA) is currently consolidating between $2.97 and $2.47. The price had dropped to the breakout level at $2.47 on Aug. 26, but the sharp rebound off it on Aug. 27 shows that bulls have flipped the level into support.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

A consolidation near the all-time high is a positive sign as it shows that traders continue to buy on dips. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If buyers drive and sustain the price above the psychological barrier at $3, the ADA/USDT pair could resume its uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $3.50.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the $2.97-to-$3 resistance zone, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. A break and close below $2.47 will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened.

The RSI on the four-hour chart has formed a negative divergence, indicating that the upward momentum may be slowing down. If bears pull and sustain the price below the 50-day simple moving average, the pair may drop to $2.47.

A strong bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $2.47 and $2.97 for some time. The bears will have to sink the price below the $2.47-to-$2.31 support zone to gain the upper hand. Alternatively, the uptrend may resume if bulls drive and sustain the price above $2.97.

LUNA/USDT

Terra protocol’s LUNA token is in a strong uptrend. After a few days of consolidation, the price rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($26.42) on Aug. 27, indicating that the sentiment remains positive.

LUNA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that bulls have the upper hand. The first target objective on the upside is a move to $43 and, if that level is crossed, the LUNA/USDT pair may rally to $50.

However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests that bears are defending the overhead resistance aggressively. If bears pull the price below $32, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA.

This is an important level for the bulls to defend. A strong bounce off it will suggest that the uptrend remains intact, but a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate that the bullish momentum has weakened.

The four-hour chart shows a broadening triangle formation, which indicates an increase in volatility. The buyers had pushed the price above the triangle but they could not sustain the breakout, suggesting aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels.

If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again make one more attempt to clear the overhead hurdle. If bulls sustain the price above the triangle, it may signal the resumption of the up-move. The pattern target of this setup is $46.95.

Alternatively, if the price breaks below the moving averages, the pair could drop to the support line of the triangle. A break and close below this support will signal that bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair may then drop to the $22.40-to-$20.81 support zone.

VET/USDT

After the sharp recovery from its recent lows at $0.05 on July 21, VeChain (VET) has formed a pennant. This setup will complete after the price breaks above or below the formation.

VET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.11) has flattened out and the RSI has dropped close to the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. A breakout and close above the resistance line of the pennant will suggest the resumption of the up-move.

The first target objective on the upside is a move to $0.16 and, if this level is crossed, the VET/USDT pair may rally to $0.19.

Conversely, if the price breaks below the support line of the pennant, the bullish view will be negated. The pair could then decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.09).

The four-hour chart shows the price is getting squeezed inside the triangle. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

The rebound off the support line is facing stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA. If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to sink the pair below the support line. If they succeed, the pair may drop to $0.082.

On the other hand, if bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair could challenge the resistance line. A breakout and close above this resistance could signal the resumption of the up-move.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) completed a rounding-bottom pattern when the price broke and closed above the overhead resistance at $4.47. This suggests the start of a new uptrend that has a pattern target at $6.85.

XTZ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Usually, after the price breaks out of a setup, it retests the breakout level. In this case, the XTZ/USDT pair could drop to $4.47. If bulls flip this level into support, it will suggest the start of a new uptrend. The rising 20-day EMA ($4.25) and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate advantage to buyers.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could trap several aggressive bulls and result in a decline to the 50-day SMA ($3.31).

The four-hour chart shows that the pair picked up momentum after it rose above the $4.47 resistance. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand.

The pair could rally to the overhead resistance zone at $6.31 to $6.50, where bears may mount a stiff resistance. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. That could open the doors for a decline to the breakout level at $4.47.

2021-08-30,NDTV Gadgets 360,Cryptocurrency Trading: What Are Some of the Red Flags and How to Spot Them,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/how-to-spot-red-flags-in-the-cryptocurrency-world-2521719,"Cryptocurrency world has several red flags. In fact, with a rise in the popularity of digital currencies, scams and unreliable projects have increased. Amateur investors can often fall for these traps. So, how do we spot these red flags? D-core, a firm of blockchain analysts and researchers, has some answers. It recommends investing in a coin only after a rigorous check of factual information. And if you sniff danger in a project, better avoid it. Leaving it on a trial-and-error method isn't going to help much in the long term.

Fundamental analysis is required to make the right choices. Every aspect, from the world's economy and crypto market trends to a project's team, needs to be kept in mind to spot red flags.

In a blogpost, D-core has highlighted a few “resources for success”. The post also added that “predictions in cryptocurrency seldom work”, and asked investors to, therefore, “look for red flags”.

The company even highlighted 3 main statistics:

Only 16 percent of traders achieve profits. The average loss of a trader is 48.5 percent. More trades than not are completed at a profit, but losses are often big enough to offset this.

This apart, the blog post mentions a few “areas to evaluate” and “their respective red flags”. The pointers mentioned include:

Tokenomics: Tokenomics has everything to do with the creation, management, and distribution of a coin. Beware of projects that issue a very high supply of tokens with an extremely low value per coin. These may be meme coin red flags. After several people invest in them, the project team starts to burn tokens, making them more scarce and more valued. Also, beware whenever teams are trying to change a coin's behaviour.

Scam projects: Two scam projects have scathed the crypto world — OneCoin and BitConnect. To avoid scam projects, always analyse the real value and use case of the coins. If the project is not used for any real purpose other than making money through profits, it is likely to fail. That's what happened with OneCoin and BitConnect.

For example, Chainlink's Oracle technology takes external data and feeds it into blockchains. That's more than just making money and has several applications, from economics to healthcare, telecommunications, governance, and more.

Decentralisation: You shouldn't choose any and every crypto project that has a use in the real world. Weigh and see if the project is useful in the world of digital assets. If not, the project may just be a way to attract capital. Check if the coin is achieving a desirable degree of decentralisation. Learn to check the code of a project to ensure that it's solid. Or familiarise yourself with auditors to know if a third party has checked them.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/cryptocurrency_mix_stock_pexels_1627728358830.jpg',)",none
2021-08-30,Gadgets 360,Bitcoin Fever Reaches Honduras With First Cryptocurrency ATM,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-atm-honduras-first-el-salvador-ethereum-price-2521450,"The first cryptocurrency ATM in Honduras opened this week as Bitcoin backers sought to spur demand for virtual assets after neighbouring El Salvador became the first country to establish bitcoin as legal tender.

The machine, locally dubbed ""la bitcoinera,"" allows users to acquire Bitcoin and Ethereum using the local lempira currency and was installed in an office tower in the capital of Tegucigalpa by Honduran firm TGU Consulting Group.

Juan Mayen, 28, chief executive of TGU, led the effort to bring the ATM to Honduras in hopes of educating people about virtual assets through first-hand experience.

Until now, there was no automated way to buy crypto-currencies, he said.

""You had to do it peer-to-peer, look for someone who ... was willing to do it, meet in person and carry X amount of cash, which is very inconvenient and dangerous given the environment in Honduras,"" he said.

On Friday, one Ethereum was trading at $3,237 (roughly Rs. 2.37 lakhs), and Bitcoin; $48,140 (roughly Rs. 35.38 lakhs). If the service is popular, Mayen said he hoped to install more units.

To make a purchase, users have to scan official identification and input personal data such as a phone number.

Many software developers in Honduras are already paid in cryptocurrencies, Mayen said, adding that it will also be a cheaper option to send remittances.

In 2020, Hondurans living abroad - mainly the United States - sent $5.7 billion (roughly Rs. 41,893 crores), about 20 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), in remittances.

The Congress of El Salvador approved in June a proposal by President Nayib Bukele to make the country the first in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.

Elsewhere in the region, lawmakers presented draft bills in Panama that regulate the use of Bitcoin and its status as a legal tender.

Bitcoin price in India was around Rs. 37.74 lakhs and price of Ethereum was around Rs. 2.5 lakhs on August 28.

2021-08-30,CNBC,Cuba's central bank now recognizes cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/cubas-central-bank-now-recognizes-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin.html,"Thousands of Cubans take part in rare protests against the communist government, marching through a town chanting ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""We want liberty"" in Havana, on July 11, 2021.

Cuba will now recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, citing ""reasons of socioeconomic interest.""

Resolution 215, which was published Thursday in the state-run Official Gazette, says the central bank will set new rules for how to deal with digital currencies. Commercial providers of related services will now need a license from the central bank to continue operations.

The American embargo on the communist state has turned Cuba into a pariah in the global economy. Cuba's decision to join El Salvador in embracing decentralized virtual cash could help the country to circumvent the U.S. sanctions regime, which was dialed up under former President Donald Trump and has been extended under President Joe Biden.

""It's historic that they are embracing it,"" said Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst, who spent four years working in crypto in Cuba.

""This is a conservative government still set in traditional Marxist ways. In fact, the communist Cuban central bank was founded by Che Guevara. The fact that they are cautiously regulating shows they are interested in what it can bring them,"" Boaz said.

Sending and receiving money between the U.S. and Cuba became extremely difficult under the Trump administration, according to Dr. Mrinalini Tankha, a professor of anthropology at Portland State University, who has been doing research on Cuba for 10 years.

In 2020, Western Union, a particularly significant channel for remittances that had been operating in Cuba for more than 20 years, shuttered all of its 400-plus locations, amid increasingly aggressive Trump-era sanctions.

The process of getting money into and out of the country was made even more complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Before the Covid outbreak, Tankha said, some Cubans would turn to underground and somewhat semi-formalized courier services called mulas, where agencies would carry cash to Cuba and distribute it to people on the island. But as the pandemic grounded flights around the world, even this path to cash became much more difficult, she said.

It was this desperate need of cash — against a backdrop of a global pandemic and blocked access to the world economy — that helped foment a rise in crypto adoption in Cuba, experts say.

""There is a kind of niche sector of people who have turned to cryptocurrency,"" said Tankha.

She credits the burgeoning crypto community for the rise of the internet in Cuba, as well as the fact that there are so many more people who have smartphones and 3G connectivity. A weak local currency is also a factor likely contributing to the appeal of bitcoin.

The use case for crypto in Cuba transcends the cross-border transfer of money. It's also about Cubans looking to open up their income-generating potential.

""If you're a software developer, or if you're an NFT artist, you could actually get paid through cryptocurrency for your labor, and I think that's where the potential actually is,"" said Tankha. ""It opens up a whole new economy for Cubans to participate in.""

Photographer Gabriel Guerra Bianchini is doing just that. Havana-based Bianchini was one of the first artists in Cuba to break into the world of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.

""My first work sold in six days for 1.6 ethereum,"" said Bianchini. ""This is bigger than just making money. This is really freedom.""

However, receiving funds, even via crypto channels, requires some creativity, because many of the exchanges require know-your-customer compliance.

""The minute that Cubans participate in this ecosystem, they face a lot of risks, even if they're operating with a VPN where they're able to hide their location,"" said Tankha.

Tankha told CNBC that many exchanges, including those not based in the U.S., continue to geo-block Cubans.

Experts told CNBC that it is still a long road ahead for mass adoption of crypto in Cuba.

The resolution itself — while a promising sign for Cubans keen to participate in the world economy via bitcoin rails — is hardly a warm embrace of all things crypto. The text includes a healthy dose of skepticism, such as a disclaimer warning citizens about the risks of virtual assets and the ancillary service providers, which the government says operate at the ""margins of the banking and financial system.""

But Sobrado is optimistic that any sort of regulatory attention with respect to crypto is a good thing.

""Regulators around the world, from communist Cuba's central bank to the SEC, are trying to come to grips with the cryptocurrency industry. This implies that crypto is a global phenomenon and regulators have decided that it's here to stay and worth engaging with,"" said Sobrado.

""Strangely enough it's bringing some sort of legitimacy to the space. It's gotten too big to ignore,"" he said.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106910035-1626177480909-gettyimages-1233929408-AFP_9ER3N8.jpeg?v=1627050044',)",none
2021-08-30,Al Jazeera,"Cuba to recognise, regulate cryptocurrency",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/27/cuba-to-recognise-regulate-cryptocurrency-govt-resolution,"Popularity of the digital currency has grown in Cuba, in part because of restrictions on remittances from the US.

Cuba has said it will recognise – and regulate – cryptocurrencies for payments on the island in a move that could help to circumvent American sanctions.

A resolution published in the Official Gazette on Thursday said the central bank will set rules on cryptocurrencies and determine how to license providers of related services within the communist state.

The announcement comes as the popularity of cryptocurrency has grown in Cuba among some technologically savvy groups, as it has become increasingly difficult to send and use US dollars on the island, in part because of toughened embargo rules imposed under former United States President Donald Trump.

While some expected President Joe Biden to seek to normalise relations, as former President Barack Obama did, he has instead taken a harder line, imposing further sanctions against Cuban officials following crackdowns on rare protests in the country.





Cuba’s move comes after El Salvador recently announced it would recognise the use of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as a way to encourage remittances from its citizens living abroad.

The currencies, which can shift wildly in value, are usually independent of any central bank and use widely distributed blockchain computer codes to keep track of transfers.

Because they can be used for long-distance transactions that are supposedly anonymous, they are often popular with people attempting to evade government regulations, which could include circumventing US restrictions on sending money to Cuba.





The resolution said the central bank can authorise use of cryptocurrencies “for reasons of socioeconomic interest” but with the state assuring operations are controlled.

It also explicitly noted that operations could not involve illegal activities.

A local cryptocurrency expert, programmer Erich García, told The Associated Press some Cubans are already using such devices, often via gift cards, for online purchases.","('https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AP21089552118817.jpg?resize=1200%2C630',)",none

Though some recovery has been observed in Bitcoin, all most other popular cryptocurrencies fell.

The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure due to heavy sell-off since Tuesday. Bitcoin was trading at $47,121.64, up 51 per cent at 11:30 am. Bitcoin’s value has fallen over $240 in the past 24 hours and its market capitalisation has increased marginally to $885 billion.

Ether’s valuation has also fallen over the past 24 hours. It was trading at $3,105.63, down 0.48 per cent. It’s market capitalisation has fallen to $363.87 billion. Other altcoins such as XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Stellar, Chainlink, Polygon and Litecoin fell.

Analysts, however, believe that the current weakness in the cryptocurrency market will fade in the near term due as digital coins witness higher adoption across the world.

Commenting on the weakness, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The past 24 hours were highly volatile for the crypto markets. Both Bitcoin and Ether made struggled to find support.”

“The entire market felt the shivers of this volatility. Altcoins went under the hammer,” he added.

“However, towards the end of the day, there was some recovery as Bitcoin seemed to settle around the $47,000 mark.”

Here are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:

The resolution says the Central Bank can authorise use of cryptocurrencies “for reasons of socioeconomic interest” but with the state assuring that their operations are controlled. It also explicitly noted that operations could not involve illegal activities.

A local cryptocurrency expert, programmer Erich García, said some Cubans are already using such devices, often via gift cards, for online purchases.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_disco_reuters_1622203490843.jpg',)",none

Crypto platform Poly Network says hacked funds returned



Cryptocurrency platform Poly Network said on Monday that almost all of the $610 million stolen this month in one of the biggest crypto heists had now been returned by the unknown person or persons behind the attack. In a Twitter post, Poly Network said it had regained control of all the assets except for $33 million in stablecoin tether that had been frozen by the company that manages it. The network said it was in talks with tether about unfreezing those funds. Read details here.

""Rather than trying to ignore or suppress cryptocurrency and related technologies, regulators and legislators alike need to recognize that open, public networks are here to stay,"" Mr. Toomey said in the news release. ""Our laws and regulations must adapt to these developments.""

2021-08-30,Mint,"Cryptocurrencies have a future, may become effective means of payment: Rajan",https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrencies-have-a-future-may-become-effective-means-of-payment-rajan-11629984774998.html,"Cryptocurrencies have a potential future and even though they have fluctuating values, these digital assets might find a way to become an effective means of payment, Raghuram Rajan , former Reserve Bank of India governor, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

The former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was more positive on well-regulated stablecoins. At the same time, he called for quick appropriate regulations for stablecoins.

A stablecoin is a digital currency that is linked to an underlying asset, such as a national currency like the US dollar or a precious metal like gold.

According to the Reuters report, Rajan was, however, not clear on the fundamentals that were driving the valuations of cryptocurrencies.

“Right now, in this heady environment with asset prices really picking up, many cryptos are also being valued — not so much as a means of payments — but as assets in their own right,"" Rajan, who is professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told Reuters.

Even in India, crypto currency exchanges are urging the government to define cryptocurrencies as digital assets and not as currency. As per industry experts, this would help the government address all its legitimate concerns with regards to financial risks associated with crypto.

Meanwhile, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the legislation on cryptocurrencies is awaiting Cabinet approval.

Rajan in his interaction with Reuters opined that some cryptocurrencies might find a way to become an effective means of payment despite their fluctuating values.

“Cross border payments are one area which is wide open, because of the huge transaction costs of making cross border payments,"" he said.

In India, growth-wise, the crypto industry has grown from four-five million people in 2018 to 15-20 million investors now with more than $1.5 billion invested. This has in part been driven by the superlative returns given by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether and dogecoin over the past three years.

Rajan believes that for cryptocurrency prices to keep on rising, these digital assets will need to find a proper use case.

“I think the value of cryptos has to be seen more in terms of are they going to be useful in the system going forward. Yes, some of them have value because they have value, and maybe that will persist. I'm not going to say that bitcoin is going to implode tomorrow. But I will say that I would be much more confident about the value of these cryptos once they find proper use cases, and the technology is evolving to make that happen,"" he said.

2021-08-30,The Motley Fool,3 Top Altcoins to Buy in September,https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/26/3-top-altcoins-to-buy-in-september/,"Every major single currency today, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin, all have one thing in common -- they were trading for pennies on the dollar during their inception. Now that they've become mainstream, their large market caps prevent their prices from going up too fast in a short time. But the same can't be said for altcoins, which are alternative cryptocurrencies launched after Bitcoin's success.

A large portion of the more than 11,000 altcoins are struggling to gain traction. But that can't be said for a few diamonds in the rough that offer high risk and high reward. So let's look at how these top altcoins can deepen investors' digital wallets. They've already realized four-digit percentage returns over the past few years.

1. Avalanche

Like Ethereum, Avalanche (CRYPTO:AVAX) is a smart contract, programmable money token. But it can settle transactions in less than a second, whereas those on the Ethereum network could take as long as four hours.

The advancement here has major implications. With the help of an oracle coin such as ChainLink, Avalanche can connect the execution of smart contracts with real-world API. This would allow parties to execute instantaneous transactions based on anything from future prices, stock market data, weather forecasts, breaking news, etc.

It shouldn't be surprising that crypto investors have already caught on to the innovation. The token has returned a staggering 2,440.38% since its inception during September 2020. What's more, the token is not inflationary, like Ethereum. I would assume capital inflows in the future will only drive the price of the token upwards. The token has a maximum supply of 720 million. In addition, the Avalanche network burns a portion of its fees with every transaction. Over 180,000 tokens have been burned since the network went live.

2. Pirate Chain

Pirate Chain (CRYPTO:ARRR) is a privacy coin that originated from a server on the popular social-platform Discord. Since then, the coin has taken off with a return of 3,212.44% in a little over two years. The coin plays a pivotal role in solving Bitcoin's non-fungibility problem.

During Bitcoin's origin, many users flocked to the cryptocurrency to transact illegal activities. However, advanced blockchain research firms like Chainalysis can now identify them by matching criminals' wallet addresses with records on the public ledger. Taking it one step further, companies can then coordinate with law enforcement to flag these Bitcoins as ""tainted."" New investors on the receiving end of laundered Bitcoins could then receive regulatory scrutiny, despite being oblivious to their coin's history.

Pirate Chain utilizes zero-knowledge cryptography (zk-SNARK) to shield outside observers, while simultaneously having a blockchain public ledger. As a result, parties to a transaction can send and receive money at will, but no one else can see the amount transacted, their wallet addresses, or wallet balances.

In addition, Pirate Chain secures itself from cyberattacks by using a delayed proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. ARRR transactions are not only notarized on the native Pirate Chain network but also on the Komodo and Bitcoin blockchains. (Miners, too, can't see the nature of transactions.)

Therefore, the only way a hacker can alter its ledger is if they launch a simultaneous 51% attack against the ARRR, Komodo, and Bitcoin blockchains, which would require an astronomical amount of hash rate. Overall, due to its high-privacy feature, virtual immunity against cyberattacks, and limited supply (185 million out of a total of 200 million tokens have been minted), Pirate Chain is an intriguing cryptocurrency investors should consider.

3. iExec RLC

iExec RLC (CRYPTO:RLC) is an innovative token that provides on-demand, decentralized cloud computing services. Users can connect their machines to the iExec network to provide computing capacity and receive rewards in RLC tokens for doing so. In addition, both application and data providers can monetize their services via the network.

It's more than an academic project. Right now, the company behind iExec RLC is collaborating with Alphabet's Google and IBM to enhance data security in cloud computing. Similar to the other tokens, iExec RLC isn't inflationary and has a maximum supply of 87 million. The token has returned 1,048.9% since its inception in 2017.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/636967/gettyimages-921032908.jpg',)",none

Arbitrage involves trading one cryptocurrency for another, or trading the same cryptocurrency on different exchanges. This method is preferred by people who are accustomed to day trading, and have an even higher appetite for risk than those who are simply day trading.

Being a hands-on trader reveals many imbalances in the market, and thus opportunities for profit each day.

For example, let’s assume XYZ coin is priced at ₹10 on one exchange and at ₹11 on the second. A person could then buy ten XYZ coins on the first exchange at ₹100, transfer the coin to the second exchange, and then sell the cryptocurrency for ₹110.

The absolute gain would seem to be ₹10. However, transaction costs could eat away as much as ₹8 and leave investors with a profit of only ₹2.

This is similar to how investors play fiat currencies against each other in traditional currency markets.

There could be more complex routes, such as transferring value between three currencies on the same exchange, to end up with a larger quantity of the first currency. This is usually done when the value of newer cryptocurrencies rises or falls considerably within minutes.

In other instances, ‘stablecoins’ whose value remains ‘tethered’ to specific national currencies – like Tether (USDT) which will remain at 1 USD – may be useful to benefit from imbalanced prices.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/85653413/Cryptocurrency-isnt-for-everyone-but-heres-how-some-are-using-digital-tokens-to-make-money.jpg',)",none
2021-08-30,India Today,"Cryptocurrency prices today: Bitcoin falls as weakness continues, other virtual coins follow",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/cryptocurrency-prices-on-august-26-update-bitcoin-dogecoin-ether-cardano-value-1845537-2021-08-26,"Prices of all popular cryptocureencies prices fell sharply on Thursday.

Cryptocurrency prices continue to fall as high volatility prevailed in the virtual coin market over the past 24 hours.

Crypto prices started falling after Monday’s trading session due to heavy profit-booking, and have remained weak since then. Experts believe volatility in crypto trade is also a result of monthly options expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, is trading slightly below $47,000, down 2.95 per cent at 12:07 pm. The virtual coin’s market capitalisation has fallen sharply to $882 billion.

It may be noted that Bitcoin had touched a high of $50,000 on Monday and its market capitalisation has inched closer to $950 billion.

Ether’s (ETH) value has also eroded sharply over the past 24 hours. It was trading at $3,109, down over 3 per cent compared to its value 24 hours ago. Ether’s market capitalisation has fallen to $363 billion.

All other altcoins also lost ground, trading 3-8 per cent lower due to the selloff observed over the past 24 hours.

Commenting on the cryptocurrency market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The crypto markets were highly volatile over the past 24 hours. Such volatility is often encountered before the monthly options expiry.”

“The spot trading volume for Bitcoin was low, indicating that the markets are not directional at the moment. Despite a minor selloff in Ether, the largest Altcoin still appears to have a strong support,” he added.

“Most other Altcoins would be replicating the movement in BTC and ETH.”

Here are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:

The world’s largest crypotcurrency was trading at $48,373, up 0.43 per cent at the time of this article. The cryptocurrency on Monday surged to $50,000, which happened for the first time after the crash that happened in May this year. In April, the world biggest currency Bitcoin surged and hit an all-time high at $65,000. Bitcoin has risen and recovered after hovering in the range of $30,000 to $40,000 for many weeks. Bitcoin steeply fell from $65,000 in April to $28,800 in June, after a massive sell-off in June and July, triggered by Chinese ban on the corporates, financial companies, payment companies, providing services related to cryptocurrency.

This week two announcements made by Paypal and Coinbase pulled up the Bitcoin around $50,000 mark.

According to Zebpay trade desk, Bitcoin has touched the $50,000 mark for the first time since May and has surged almost by 72 per cent from its recent low of $29,301. Technically on the weekly time frame, the asset is trading in an uptrend forming a ‘Higher Highs Higher Lows’ pattern. BTC may face some resistance around $51,109 levels (61.8 per cent Fibonacci Retracement Level) and if these levels are breached with good volumes then we can expect the asset to further rally up to $57,000.

On the other hand, Ether, the rival currency of Bitcoin was trading at $3166 or down 0.86 per cent at the time of this article. It was trading up 5.97 per cent over the last week. The market cap for Ether stood at $375.72 billion. The third spot was occupied by Cardano, which was trading at $2.66, down 3.53 per cent at the time of this article.

The volume of all stable coins is now $88.73B, which is 78.84 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per the Coinmarketcap.com.

“The cryptocurrency spectrum kept searching for a sturdy support. Bitcoin hovered above the $48,000 level, allowing bears to enter the markets. Despite a minor correction, there is no reason to fret. The bulk of the activity is in the derivatives market as over $1.7 billion worth of contracts will expire in the next two days.

2021-08-30,CNBC,"TikTok changed its policies, now cryptocurrency influencers consider moving to rival platforms",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/tiktok-policy-change-hurt-cryptocurrency-creators.html,"In this article BTC.CB=

A man holding a phone walks past a sign of Chinese company ByteDance's app TikTok, known locally as Douyin, at the International Artificial Products Expo in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China October 18, 2019. Reuters

If Lucas Dimos gets one more video removed from TikTok, he suspects he'll get kicked off the platform forever. In the last month, at least 10 of his videos have been taken down for promoting illegal activities and regulated goods. But Dimos, who posts content on a TikTok account called theblockchainboy, says he hasn't done anything wrong. ""It's left my account on such a razor's edge,"" said Dimos. ""We're dying out here. We're floundering. We've tried to build a community and guide this whole movement in the right direction."" TikTok cryptocurrency content creators like Dimos, who claim they are just trying to educate consumers about the emerging market, say they have been hard hit by rapid changes at the social media company. In July, TikTok implemented a system that can automatically block videos violating its policies, and the company recently updated its branded content policy, barring the promotion of financial services including cryptocurrencies, unless users disclose it through a branded content option in the app. CNBC spoke with 11 cryptocurrency creators for this story who say they have posted educational crypto videos, yet their content is getting flagged or taken down permanently with little explanation from TikTok. Some said their accounts are also getting temporarily banned more frequently. Most of the influencers CNBC spoke with said they haven't been paid to promote any crypto content on TikTok in the last few weeks, and that video views and new followers have dwindled since July.

TikTok declined to comment on the reports from creators. Instead, a spokesperson pointed CNBC to the company's community guidelines page. The spokesperson would not specify which guidelines crypto creators were violating. When videos are pulled from TikTok, the creators say they get a notification that they violated community guidelines. Sometimes it notes that they posted content related to 'illegal activities and regulated goods.' The guidelines haven't been updated since December, though TikTok rolled out its new detection feature a little over a month ago, when creators say the takedowns ramped up. Some of the creators CNBC spoke with are considering shifting to platforms like Google-owned YouTube, Twitter, Facebook's Instagram and the chatting app Discord, where they say they have more freedom to share content. ""The real issue isn't the advertisements,"" said a cryptocurrency influencer who goes by Wendy O. ""It's the fact that TikTok is shadow banning and censoring crypto content creators and a lot of us are posting great educational pieces.""

Navigating unknown terrain

The creators CNBC spoke with say the recent updates are warranted to crackdown on spam accounts or fraudulent money-making schemes like ""rug pulls,"" where individuals entice users to buy into a crypto, prop up the price and pull out. But they say the system is overcompensating and affecting those who are just trying to educate their audiences about crypto. ""It was almost like a knee-jerk reaction from TikTok against all of these scams that were going on,"" said Dimos, who has over 314,000 followers on the platform. ""While they may have blocked the scam posts, all of us creators are unable to post any of our content."" In recent weeks, creators say they can't use words like ""Binance,"" ""decentralized finance,"" or specific coins like bitcoin or ethereum in a video without it getting removed. The consensus among creators is that those words alert the algorithm, leading to an automatic takedown or review. Chart analysis and forecasting also flag the system, according to creators like Timothy, who goes by cryptoweatherman on TikTok. Under its community guidelines, TikTok says it will remove content ""including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, and text"" in violation, and that it uses a ""mix of technology and human moderation"" to enforce its guidelines before content is even reported. If a video is removed, the user is typically notified that the post violates a community guideline or relates to ""illegal activities and regulated goods."" But the message doesn't offer specifics, the creators said. The creators CNBC spoke with said if they get two videos taken down, they are banned from posting content for at least 24 hours. Bans can last anywhere from a day to a week, the creators who CNBC spoke with said. TikTok's guidelines say that users are notified when content is removed and that they can appeal the takedown if they ""believe no violation has occurred."" The company also says it will suspend or ban accounts that are repeatedly ""involved in severe or repeated violations"" and that they take into account ""information available on other platforms and offline in these decisions."" When the creators reach out to TikTok about an account ban or pulled video, most say they have been ignored or sent an automated response. There's no phone number to call, no representative to email, yet, some creators say when they appeal the takedown TikTok reinstates many videos. Joshua Thillens, who goes by Joshua Jake on TikTok, says he's had at least eight videos taken down. When CNBC spoke with Mason Versluis, a creator with nearly 430,000 followers on an account called cryptomasun, he was experiencing a 48-hour ban, which prevented him from posting. Prior to the guideline change, Versluis had one video taken down showing a car crash. In the last few weeks, he said between 30 and 35 of his videos have been taken down. Most were reinstated after he submitted an appeal. ""I'm not claiming to be a financial wizard or a financial advisor or even a trader,"" Versluis said. ""I'm simply someone who's been in crypto for four years. I've studied this in-depth and the information I bring and the opinions should speak for themselves.""

Views and followers reach a bottleneck

Many creators also say views and followers have slowed in recent weeks and followers say the creators aren't showing up on their ""For You"" pages. TikTok's community guidelines say the company may limit a post's visibility in search results and other feeds. Mack Lorden, who has over 102,000 followers on TikTok, says he quickly built his following when he launched his platform in January. But he ""reached a bottleneck"" last month, a change he attributes to both the guideline change and the price drop in the crypto market. Smaller creators like Miguel Morales, who has a little over 5,200 followers on his account called blockchaincrusader, are also feeling the pinch. Morales says views have dropped on good videos from almost 100,000 to 10,000. On a good day, he's lucky to get over 1,000 views. Nick Dye, who has over 14,400 followers on his account called the_cryptokeeper, says he was getting 300 to 400 followers a day consistently within the first few months of launching his account and after posting a viral video. He said new followers went from hundreds to maybe three or six per day after the policy change. His first 12,000 followers he says he got in just 25 days. The last couple thousand has taken double the time. ""No one knows what they can and can't say,"" Dye said. ""It discourages the newer creators like myself that have the knowledge and experience that they can offer. We're scared to share things for fear of getting banned.""

Getting creative with crypto content

In the weeks since the changes, creators say they are getting creative with the content they post. Wendy O. recently posted a series of videos referring to cryptocurrencies as ketos. Dye calls ethereum his ""girlfriend."" Carla Nasui and Walker Van Dixhorn, who are known as The Crypto Couple, have always used comedy to discuss crypto, a setup they say has kept them from getting banned. Morales has cut back from making three videos a day to just two. Some creators CNBC spoke with have done sponsored content in the past and say they can make anywhere from $300 to $20,000, depending on their following. That payment is occasionally made in cryptocurrencies. Versluis has partnered with DAO Maker, a crowdfunding platform that also serves as a launchpad for some cryptos, and IOI, one of the cryptocurrencies launched through it. Wendy O. created content for a platform involved in crypto-lending called Celsius. Some also make money through paid Discord subscriptions and one-on-one investing sessions. But all of the creators CNBC interviewed said they make most of their content for fun or to educate the masses and they never explicitly tell users to buy into a coin.

Cryptocurrency adoption has rapidly gained momentum in India despite uncertainty around the future of the unregulated digital asset. Investments in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, has registered a breathtaking rise in India since 2020.

Data from several domestic cryptocurrency exchanges suggest that millions of retail investors have signed up on their portals to invest in cryptocurrencies — an asset class known for notorious volatility and potential to deliver high returns.

At least 1.5 crore Indians have invested in cryptocurrencies, signalling strong cryptocurrency growth in a nation where households are known to invest more frequently in gold and other safer assets. The growing number of crypto adopters also suggests a shift in the investment paradigm, driven mostly by the country's younger population.

Explained: The good, bad and ugly of investing in cryptocurrencies

WHY MORE INDIANS ARE SHIFTING TO CRYPTOCURRENCIES?

More Indians started investing in cryptocurrencies from 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic led to a global economic crisis, resulting in higher volatility and depreciation in traditional assets like currencies, bonds and equities. As a result, more people around the globe started investing in cryptocurrencies.

This resulted in a sharp rise in crypto valuations throughout 2020, led by popular virtual coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

In India, cryptocurrency investments grew from approximately $923 million in April 2020 to a whopping $6.6 billion in May 2021. India ranks 11th out of 154 nations in terms of cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report prepared by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

While investments in gold are considered as an ideal hedge in times of economic downturn, more young Indians seem to have changed their appetite. As the situation stands, digital coin investments form a faction of bullion market holdings but younger Indians — between the age group of 18 and 35 years — find cryptocurrency a better option compared to gold.

The latest World Gold Council data also show that Indian adults, aged 34 or less, have a lower appetite for gold. A number of cryptocurrency experts said the tech-savvy younger population find it easier to invest in cryptocurrency than gold due to the processes involved.

WILL MORE INDIANS JOIN THE CRYPTO RACE?

Many Indians want to invest in cryptocurrencies but are worried about the asset’s uncertain future in the country. But data from domestic cryptocurrency exchanges indicate healthy growth in the number of investors.

Popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the country including WazirX, ZebPay, Unocoin and CoinDCX have seen massive growth in retail investors on their platform since 2020. They have recently seen a sharp rise in investors, days before Bitcoin’s value crossed $50,000 after a period of three months.

It may be noted that cryptocurrencies hit a rough patch earlier this year when China started a regulatory crackdown on virtual coins. The negative momentum dented the crypto market for months, following which virtual coins have recovered again.

Experts tracking the sector and founders of cryptocurrency exchanges believe that rapid fintech advancements and greater adoption will lead to a rise in the number of Indians investing in cryptocurrencies in the near future.

In fact, some of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges have invested in India due to growing virtual coin trade volumes and the rising number of retail participants. While there is uncertainty over the cryptocurrency ecosystem in India, global coin exchanges have found it hard to ignore the potential for growth in a country of 1.3 billion people.

Domestic exchanges are confident that more investors will join the cryptocurrency race in India after Bitcoin’s recent advance. After Bitcoin crossed $50,000 on Monday, cryptocurrency exchanges have seen a jump in their trading volumes and the value of investments.

The recent surge in the cryptocurrency market has not only led to a jump in new investors but also rekindled interest among old traders. Many analysts feel that the recent jump in virtual coin prices is linked to the rise in global cryptocurrency adoption.

LOOKING BEYOND BITCOIN

Experts tracking the cryptocurrencies have observed another positive trend: There is less panic among investors during sudden market dips and high volatility.

Many cryptocurrency exchange owners feel that investors have developed a greater understanding of the virtual coin market, leading to sustained trading rather than just plain buying.

Investors have realised that investing in smaller cryptocurrencies could reap as much profit as Bitcoin or Ether. As Indian investors dive deeper into the world of cryptocurrencies, they have started looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ether, which are expensive compared to altcoins — a term given other popular cryptocurrencies in the virtual coin ecosystem.

FACTBOX — CRYPTOCURRENCY ADOPTION IN INDIA At least 1.5 crore Indians hold cryptocurrencies assets Cryptocurrency investments have grown rapidly in India to $6.6 billion as of May 2021 Indians aged between 18-35 years are primarily driving cryptocurrency investments in the country India ranks 11th out of 154 nations in terms of cryptocurrency adoption Cryptocurrency exchanges feel more Indians want to invest in digital coins but are worried about the future Global cryptocurrency exchanges have invested heavily in India despite uncertainties

Instead of buying expensive cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ether, investors are also putting their money on lower-priced virtual coins such as XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Polkadot, Chainlink, Solana, UniSwap and more.

As mentioned earlier, calculated investments in altcoins could lead to massive gains as well. For instance, Cardano witnessed a sharp surge in valuation over the past few weeks. Therefore, any investment in Cardano over the past week could have led to healthy gains.

There is a notion, however, that Bitcoin’s value is still a driving factor behind the movements of altcoins. While this is true to some extent, there are days when altcoins outperform market leaders like Bitcoin and Ether. This is similar to when stock market madcaps and small caps outperform benchmarks like Sensex and Nifty.

ALL EYES ON THE GOVERNMENT'S CRYPTO BILL

Cryptocurrency trade has witnessed a boom in India over the past couple of years and there is scope for better growth, but there is one major hurdle. Regulatory uncertainty remains at large as the government is yet to come out with its cryptocurrency bill.

All eyes remain on the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which will determine the future of virtual coin trade in the country. The bill is currently awaiting approval from the Union Cabinet, following which it will be introduced in parliament.

While the government had earlier said it would enforce a ban on private cryptocurrencies, there has been a change in its stance, with officials hinting that trading activities could be regulated — a scenario favoured by all major cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country.

Many cryptocurrency exchanges believe that the early adoption of digital coin trade will help India gain an advantage in the rapidly growing global cryptocurrency ecosystem. They also believe that more people will start investing in cryptocurrencies once the government provides some clarity on the subject.","('https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202108/Cryptocurrency_demand_decoded-647x363.png?2E1Rmheloc6oUMCOpIL.mxJiA8dKXWPx',)",none
2021-08-23,News.com.au,Cardano tipped to replace Ethereum as second-largest cryptocurrency,https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/wealth/cardano-tipped-to-overtake-ethereum-as-secondlargest-cryptocurrency/news-story/a5734e7883b9e1781e8b9988cb575d17,"A mostly unknown cryptocurrency is on the right track to take out the number two position and potentially even kick bitcoin out of its prime spot.

A cryptocurrency which seemingly came out of nowhere is on the right track to take out the number two position and potentially even kick bitcoin out of its prime spot.

Confidence is building around cardano, a blockchain invented in 2015, after it overtook binance to come third on the crypto ladder, behind bitcoin and ethereum.

Experts think the coin has set its sights on surpassing ethereum next.

Last week, cardano (known as ADA in the crypto market) surged to a market capitalisation of $111.23 billion, officially overtaking binance which stood at $99.38 billion.

According to cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko, cardano has continued to skyrocket in the past week, rising by 35 per cent to $123.36 billion at time of writing.

Over the past 30 days, the coin has risen to nearly 187 per cent.

It’s believed cardano’s new-found popularity is from of the announcement of a major upgrade to the network called the Alonzo hard fork.

The coin’s more environmentally-friendly processing abilities, and its debut on the Japanese market, are also adding to the fervour.

Cardano is currently selling for $3.85.

Although that’s significantly less than its rival ethereum, which is sitting on $4429.23 per coin, experts have predicted that major gains are on the horizon.

Independent crypto analyst and YouTuber Lark Davis said that if cardano quadruples its value, which is possible given its current gains, it would hit the same market cap as ethereum.

And if it rose by 10 times, then it would have be neck and neck with the largest ever cryptocurrency, bitcoin.

An expert’s prediction on crypto.

What is Cardano?

Perhaps it’s not surprising that cardano is posing a very real threat to ethereum, considering that it was founded by someone who also created the ether token.

Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson created cardano in 2015 and launched it in 2017.

The coin is known as ADA on the crypto market, which is an homage to Augusta “Ada” King, or Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century British countess largely regarded as the first computer programmer.

She was also the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron.

Cardano has just hit the Japanese market.

What is the Alonzo hard fork update?

Last week, cardano announced the Alonzo hard fork which caused interest in the coin to hit an all-time high.

The upgrade allows for smart contracts to happen, which are pieces of computer code that can automatically execute when the right parameters are set.

That means once the Alonzo update is complete, anyone can make their own smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain, paving the way for native decentralised applications (dapps), according to CoinDesk.

Decentralised applications allows people to borrow, lend and trade with each other instantly, without any interference from a third party such as waiting on a bank to make the transaction.

The Alonzo hard fork is the third major update in cardano’s current stage.

The token has five main stages of development, also called “eras” which aim to expand the network and make it run as smoothly as possible.

They are named after famous writers from the Romantic movement of the 1800s: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, Voltaire.

Alonzo is the last major update for the Shelley era and moves the platform towards the Goguen era.

The Alonzo update is expected to begin sometime during the third quarter of this year.

Other reasons for the price spike

Another reason for cardano’s surge is that from Wednesday, the coin will be listed on Japan’s exchange.

Japan’s criteria to enter the market is considered one of the strictest in the world, which is another win for cardano.

Bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin are also on the Japanese market.

Cardano is also hugely popular because its proof of stake blockchain model is considered much more environmentally-friendly than any other mainstream cryptocurrency.

Proof of stake works means coins are randomly allocated to users, cutting down the energy needed for a transaction.

In contrast, bitcoin and ethereum use a proof of work mechanism which sees a global network of computers running simultaneously to facilitate a transaction.

Such a method requires an enormous amount of energy, with Bitcoinenergyconsumption.com estimating that bitcoin generated over 57 million tonnes of CO2 in a year – the same carbon footprint as a small European country.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a751d69b6c9ba78ad577b5b2334101e8',)",none

ET Spotlight Special

A little-known digital token tied to the Cardano blockchain has just surpassed other top alt-coins to become the third-largest virtual currency worldwide, as network developers aim to capitalise on the surge in decentralised finance that has swept the world.Currently, the popular alt-coin traded on cryptocurrency exchanges like CoinSwitch Kuber , Cardano's native coin, ADA, defied a major price crash warning to rise to an all-time high, surpassing the previous record. For the very first time on Friday, the ADA/USD rate of exchange surpassed $2.56, marking the culmination of a 154.54% price increase that began on July 20. This was achieved despite renowned trader Peter Brandt's warning of a price fall, which was predicated on a typical bearish pattern known as the head and shoulders pattern.With the price of the ADA coin soaring by about 50% in only the past week, there is growing confidence that new technological advancements will enable payment systems on Cardano earlier than the previously declared date of September 12. This will allow its network to provide profitable services like DeFi, where Ethereum presently holds a dominant position.In anticipation of the planned “Alonzo” upgrade, which is scheduled to be released on September 12, ADA investors are continuing to drive the value of Cardano higher. The Alonzo upgrade will bring smart-contract* functionality to the blockchain, allowing Cardano to establish itself as a legitimate player in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space.ADA is among the most highly sought-after cryptocurrencies for new traders due to its still-relatively low price and excellent marketing as one of the potential ""Ethereum killers."" There is little reason to suspect that Cardano is a favourite of the crypto world, and ADA is among the most highly sought-after cryptocurrencies for new traders due to its still-relatively low price and a promising future.With Cardano's ability to handle smart contracts—self-executing agreements among buyers and sellers—the token has gained consistently while Ethereum, Cardano’s core competitor, continues to dominate the growing $100 billion decentralised finance sector.Recently, the Solana blockchain ecosystem began to take shape with DeFi and NFTs, but despite the fact that Cardano has no actual use cases as of yet, the cryptocurrency's market capitalization is about 4x the size of Sol's market capitalization of $20 billion. Cardano has practically risen from the ashes on the backs of speculators and the promise of a fantastic and extremely transparent development team.Smart contracts, also known as blockchain contracts, are distinguished by the method in which they assure conformity between the two parties involved in the transaction. The immutability of a self-executing contract is one of the most notable characteristics of this type of contract. It implies that once codes, regulations, and even transactions have been written into the blockchain, it is hard to reverse, alter, change, or tamper with them.Smart contracts, similar to the traditional ones, are contracts between two or more parties that do not require the participation of a third party to monitor or enforce the agreement.As part of its operation, the blockchain network preserves a transaction record that is visible, secure, and unchangeable, ensuring that evidence of ownership is established and transferred. Contract discussion and application are made considerably more accessible, and the whole edit record of the deal is made publicly visible to all parties involved.When people use decentralised finance, also known as DeFi, they are transferring financial functions directly onto digital ledgers, allowing them to perform things such as, lend or borrow cash and collect interest in a savings-like account, all without the need for traditional middlemen such as banks. Its growing prevalence is part of a broader trend of rising blockchain usage, which is becoming more widespread.A series of recent rises in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, ADA, and other tokens pushed the cryptocurrency market to surpass $2 trillion in value this weekend, a first since the mid-May crash.With a gain of 1,300% in only one year, ADA is among the top-five best-performing cryptocurrencies, outpacing gains of 1,030% for Binance Coin, 330% for Ether, and 59% for Bitcoin, among other cryptocurrencies. The token, on the other hand, is extremely vulnerable to the enormous volatility of the larger cryptocurrency market.As a result of RBI’s crypto crackdown in 2018, the value of ADA plummeted by roughly 90%, ushering in a years-long bear market for the young sector. However, with the emergence of popular crypto exchanges in India, investments in crypto assets jumped from $200 million in 2019 to $40 billion in 2020. As of today, CoinSwitch Kuber , India’s leading crypto exchange has over 9 million registered users invested in crypto.All eyes will now be on the September 12 “Alonzo” upgrade and how it will tie back to ADA’s current positive run. If things go well, ADA could be seen as a primary competitor to Ethereum, ushering yet another era in the cryptocurrency sector.The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.

The entire cryptocurrency market capitalisation has dropped by 4 per cent in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin, which had crossed $50,000 for the first time since May on Monday, retreated yesterday due to profit-booking by investors, according to a Reuters news report quoting Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.

It may be noted that Bitcoin has gained 82 per cent since hitting a yearly low of $27,700 in January. As of 11:20 am, Bitcoin was trading at $48,372.89, down 2.39 per cent. The popular cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation has dipped to $912.19 billion, signalling weakness in the market.

Ether’s valuation fell to $3,212, down nearly 4 per cent. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation dipped to $376 billion. All other altcoins including XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Stellar, Polkadot, Uniswap, Chainlink and Litecoin saw a sharp fall in valuation.

Commenting on the weakness in the virtual coin market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “Bitcoin seems to be facing strong resistance at the current price. Since its drop below $50,000, the bears have been in a dominating position.”

“The nearest strong support is at $46,750. The selloff across most Altcoins was much higher. Over the past 24 hours, we witnessed the entire market cap drop by almost 4%, with traded volumes going up,” he added.

""It indicates the bearish momentum prevailing in the markets currently.”

2021-08-23,The Motley Fool,Why Cryptocurrencies Are Down Big Today,https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/24/why-cryptocurrencies-are-down-big-today/,"What happened

In another volatile day, cryptocurrencies dropped rapidly on Tuesday, more than reversing Monday's gains. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) has fallen 3%, Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) is down 5%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) has dropped 7.6%. Momentum also appears to be pushing these cryptocurrencies lower, so the fall may not be over yet.

As usual, regular volatility is likely the biggest driver with cryptocurrencies simply selling off as investors take profits. But there are some fundamental concerns that investors are likely worried about as well.

So what

I think the biggest concern is hackers stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks. The $600 million hack of the Poly Network hit the sector a couple of weeks ago, but those funds have now been returned. It's a lower-profile $97 million heist last week that investors may just be hearing about. Theives have reportedly already ""cleaned"" $20 million in cryptocurrencies that may not be recovered and it's possible most of the stolen cryptocurrency is gone. If hacking risk grows, it could be terrible for cryptocurrencies long-term.

The regulatory front is full of risks as well. SEC chair Gary Gensler has said he is in favor of rules that protect investors and consumers without completely killing cryptocurrencies. And for now that means treating them as securities, just like any stock or bond. That comes with a double-edged sword: On one hand, it signals legitimacy that could increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies; on the other hand, it could mean broad tax consequences for traders and investors. And with rules still up in the air, it's not surprising to see a pullback when cryptocurrencies rise like they did yesterday.

On the trading angle, it's not unusual for an asset to pull back after a quick increase in price. In the case of each of these cryptocurrencies, you can see that they jumped over 50% in value over the last month, before today's pullback. Sometimes a correction is just a normal part of investing.

Now what

The battle between cryptocurrency fans and the traditional financial infrastructure continues, and it will be a volatile ride. But I think it's clear that cryptocurrencies are carving out a niche for themselves, whether that's as a store of value or a way to pay for goods and services. But there are still unknowns when it comes to how governments around the world will treat cryptocurrencies.

What's most concerning long-term is the regular hacks that hit cryptocurrency wallets. If investors and consumers can't trust that their cryptocurrency will be safe they may not adopt it as widely as many hope. And that's ultimately what will keep cryptocurrency values from growing.

I would chalk today up as another example of volatility in cryptocurrencies, but watch the hacking and regulatory trends for cryptocurrencies because that's what will likely tell us if this pullback is temporary or the start of a downward trend.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640537/bitcoin-bubble-bursting.jpg',)",none

More than 10% of those surveyed said they're invested in cryptocurrency, ranking the digital coins fourth after real estate, stocks, mutual funds and bonds. Some 65% of those cryptocurrency investors jumped into the asset class in the last year, according to the survey. In the same timeframe, the prices of some of the top cryptocurrencies have displayed trademark volatility. Bitcoin, for example, surged to an all-time high of more than $63,000 in April, slumped afterwards and then recently rallied again to nearly $50,000. Among those who do trade cryptocurrencies, the top reasons cited are that it's easy to make trades, it's exciting to invest in and there's potential for high growth in a short period of time, according to the survey.

""There are a lot of things that make crypto very attractive; the biggest one is the opportunity to make a lot of money,"" said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York. Education is key Of course, there is still risk associated with investing in cryptocurrency, as there is with any other asset. The space may be exciting and cool, said Boneparth, ""but it doesn't change the fact that you're still putting risk on your money."" For people who are interested in jumping in, experts recommend that they first do their research on cryptocurrency to make sure they really understand what they're buying. More from Invest in You:

2021-08-23,Business - Insider,What is Ethereum? What to know before investing,https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-ethereum,"Ethereum is a general-purpose decentralized computing platform that uses blockchain technology.

is a general-purpose decentralized computing platform that uses blockchain technology. Ether (ETH) is Ethereum's native currency, and it is currently the second-largest cryptocurrency by volume.

by volume. Despite its popularity and wide applications, Ethereum remains a highly speculative investment.

Ethereum and Bitcoin have nearly become household names. However, while they're often mentioned in tandem, they're far from the same.

Bitcoin was created as an alternative, decentralized currency. Ethereum draws inspiration from Bitcoin, but has bigger aspirations: To create a software platform that not only supports cryptocurrencies, but any kind of decentralized application that can run without the need of a third party, thus giving people more control over their data.

What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized computing platform network. The Ethereum network works like the Bitcoin network in that it's built on blockchain technology, essentially a digital public ledger where financial agreements can be verified and stored entirely by software - without intervention of a third party.

The easiest way to think of the Ethereum network is as a secure database that's accessible to anyone. When new ""blocks"" of data get added, they're cryptographically ""chained"" to a parent block, effectively making an uneditable record of the previous changes.

Ethereum is considered one of the largest cryptocurrencies (next to Bitcoin), because ether is the second largest crypto next to bitcoin by market capitalization.

Note: The process of mining cryptocurrency is known as proof of work. However, Ethereum developers have plans to adopt an alternative method, called proof of stake, which requires less energy and makes mining more accessible.

But what makes Ethereum so exciting to users and enthusiasts is the network's potential to do more than just handle financial transactions. Ethereum takes the Bitcoin blockchain further by allowing developers to run programs (known as ""smart contracts"") that can host any kind of decentralized application (known as ""dApps"").

""Bitcoin was the pioneer of blockchain technology, used to create a peer-to-peer payment system,"" says Jacob Wade, a financial coach and president of iHeartBudgets. ""Ethereum uses similar blockchain technology, but added the ability to create decentralized applications on top of its platform.""

People have already created and launched a variety of dApps on Ethereum, including games, marketplaces for digital art, and decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.

How does Ethereum work?

Ethereum works by using computing power to power the network. In practice, this means people and organizations are using their computers to run specific software, or nodes. Anyone can set up their computer to run a node.

""Ethereum relies on node operators to process transactions on the Ethereum network,"" says Wade. ""These operators collect a fee for running the hardware and software necessary to facilitate these transactions.""

The fees are called gas fees because they keep the network running. And they're paid in ether (ETH).

Consider the many ways that you could use a large network of computers. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum uses it to power peer-to-peer transactions and track who owns the ether cryptocurrency. Additionally, developers can create and run dApps on the network.

The dApps connect to the Ethereum blockchain with ""smart contracts,"" which are more like computer programs than contracts in the traditional sense of the word.

""Smart contracts are small programs stored on the Ethereum blockchain that can self-execute when certain conditions are met,"" says Robert Farrington, founder of The College Investor. ""A good way to think about it is that the dapp is the front-end of the program, and the smart contract is the backend of the program.""

Also, dApps rely on the decentralized and open-source Ethereum network and can't be controlled by a single entity. In fact, once a dApp is added to the Ethereum platform, it can't be taken down - even if the original creator wants to remove it or disbands entirely.

The decentralized system can lead to more anonymity for users, who may be able to pseudonymously use dApps. And it can also result in less control and censorship from third parties, including corporations and governments.

Is ether the same as Ethereum?

Ethereum and ether work in tandem, but they're not the same. ""Ethereum is the technology, and ether is the actual cryptocurrency,"" explains Farrington. ""You can think of ether as the actual 'cash' or fuel that powers the Ethereum network.""

If you want to invest in Ethereum, you can buy ether on a cryptocurrency exchange. You may also be able to use ether to buy other products or services, similar to how you can use bitcoins and other currencies. Ether could also potentially act as a ""store of value,"" similar to how you may want to buy and hold gold.

A brief history of Ethereum

Ethereum was originally conceived of by Vitalik Buterin, who published an introductory white paper on the idea in 2013. The basic idea was to build on the blockchain technology that Bitcoin uses to create a decentralized and programmable platform.

Here are a few key moments in Ethereum's history beyond its original inception:

2014: Ether goes on sale for the first time and people could initially buy 2,000 ether for one bitcoin. The Ethereum blockchain publicly launched the next year.

Ether goes on sale for the first time and people could initially buy 2,000 ether for one bitcoin. The Ethereum blockchain publicly launched the next year. 2016: The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) hack leads to a disagreement about whether people should get back the money they lost. The resulting DAO fork leads to the creation of Ethereum Classic - a continuation of the original blockchain - and Ethereum.

Forks of Ethereum

Ethereum has also changed since it was first launched. ""When blockchain technology changes (or upgrades), a fork can occur - just like a fork in the road,"" says Farrington. ""When this happens, it can be a soft fork or hard fork.""

In general, there are what's known as soft forks and hard forks in ethereum:

Soft forks can be minor changes that are backward compatible. Node operators can stay connected to the blockchain, but they're incentives to upgrade to the latest version if they want to continue earning ether.

can be minor changes that are backward compatible. Node operators can stay connected to the blockchain, but they're incentives to upgrade to the latest version if they want to continue earning ether. Hard forks are major upgrades that can significantly change the system and aren't backward compatible. Node operators need to switch to the latest version to keep the blockchain going. Or, if there's a disagreement, a split could result in two competing blockchains.

Often, changes are proposed and discussed in an attempt to form consensus before making a change. For example, there's a multiple-step upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, which may be completed in late 2021 or early 2022. The update will make significant changes to how Ethereum works, and may help make it more scalable and ecologically sustainable.

Ethereum vs. Bitcoin

Ether and bitcoin are both popular cryptocurrencies that rely on blockchain technology, but they're far from identical.

""Ethereum is also a technology platform that enables smart contracts - which is very different from Bitcoin, which is essentially just a store of value,"" says Farrington. ""This aspect of smart contracts on Ethereum unlocks a lot of potential use cases that you can't do with Bitcoin.""

Ethereum Bitcoin It's an open-source platform built with blockchain technology that uses the ether cryptocurrency. Developers can create and run dApps on the Ethereum network. The total number of potential ether isn't predetermined. It's a cryptocurrency built using blockchain technology. It's primarily used to store value or purchase goods and services. There's a finite number of bitcoins that can be created.

Is Ethereum a good investment?

It depends. There's no one right answer for anyone looking to invest in Ethereum. The major thing to know that like any investment - it's risky and should be considered as such before adding it to any portfolio.

Advertisement

Ether is becoming more widely available and there's a lot of noise in the news about it's rising value - but it's always important not to get sucked into the speculation too much.

""It may serve some purpose in a portfolio, but it should be a very small amount and be viewed as highly speculative,"" says Farrington. ""It's also important to note that it's still very early - so while the technology is promising, it's unknown which technology may win in the long run.""

In the news: Ethereum network changes could make cryptocurrency staking a $40 billion industry within a few years.

The financial takeaway

Ethereum uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform. The ether cryptocurrency is the ""fuel"" that powers the network, and you can invest in the Ethereum network by buying ether. ""As with any cryptocurrency, buying Ether is a speculative investment,"" warns Wade. ""Always do your research before investing into any digital currency, and don't risk more than you are willing to lose.""

If you're interested in cryptocurrencies more broadly, you could also look for ways to invest in companies that participate in the space rather than buying a single cryptocurrency.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/85600401/what-is-ethereum-what-to-know-before-investing.jpg?imgsize=61766',)",none

Chesnot/Getty Images

Investment in cryptocurrency funds and products brought in $21 million last week, said CoinShares.

Solana drew in $7.1 million, the largest amount among all digital assets.

Solana's price has been on a tear, more than doubling in August.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Investment in crypto products and funds snapped six weeks of outflows by drawing $21 million last week, led by Solana, the token on the high-speed blockchain network that's seen its value double in August alone.

Solana was the standout cryptocurrency last week as inflows of $7.1 million outpaced that of other digital assets, said CoinShares, a digital asset management company in a weekly update published Monday.

Solana is widely regarded as a competitor to Ethereum, a blockchain platform on which so-called smart contracts are built. Solana's price jumped by 75% to $78.72 in a seven-day run ended August 20, and during Monday's session, it marked a 105% surge from the end of July.

The altcoin has been attracting attention following capital inflows into a number of projects based on Solana's blockchain. Solana is home to Serum, a decentralized exchange founded by crypto-billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.

Crypto funds are now carrying $57.3 billion in total assets under management, the highest amount since mid-May, a reflection of positive price action and an indication of improved investor sentiment, said CoinShares.

Ethereum, whose token is ether, logged ""minor"" inflows of $3.2 million last week, and Cardano brought in $6.4 million.

Bitcoin was the most traded cryptocurrency, and had outflows of $2.8 million, the seventh consecutive week of outflows that matched the longest run since January 2018. ""While this may suggest sentiment remains negative, it masks very mixed flows across providers,"" said CoinShares.

Bitcoin traded above $50,000 on Monday, surpassing that price on Sunday for the first time since May 15.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/6110f1d638aff7001890788f?format=jpeg',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,Coinbase slammed for what users say is terrible customer service after hackers drain their accounts,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/coinbase-slammed-for-terrible-customer-service-after-hackers-drain-user-accounts.html,"In this article COIN

For Tanja Vidovic, it was a moment of panic: She had received a series of alerts about someone changing access to her cryptocurrency account. And she realized, as she stared at her computer screen, that nearly all of her $168,000 in holdings was gone — vanished before her eyes. She was stunned. Nearly four months have passed, and it has yet to sink in, she said. Tanja and Jared Vidovic jumped into cryptocurrency investing in 2017 and watched their funds nearly quadruple over four years. The Vidovics used Coinbase, the country's largest cryptocurrency exchange, for their plunge into the virtual currency. On exchanges such as Coinbase, users can deposit U.S. dollars and trade them for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, which the couple purchased. ""I looked into Coinbase, and it seemed like it was one that everybody used and trusted,"" Tanja said. The growing investment was a welcome boon for the Safety Harbor, Florida, couple and their three children. But in late April, Tanja, a firefighter, opened her computer to a barrage of security alerts and password change notifications. ""I signed onto the crypto. And I said, 'It's gone,'"" Tanja said. The Vidovics said they tried to contact Coinbase but they couldn't get anybody on the phone. Interviews with Coinbase customers around the country and a review of thousands of complaints reveal a pattern of account takeovers, where users see money suddenly vanish from their account, followed by poor customer service from Coinbase that made those users feel left hanging and angry. Making the issue even worse, cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reversed, according to the FBI. Experts say once criminals access an account, funds can be drained in minutes. Coinbase, which went public in April, has a market cap of about $65 billion, has more than 68 million users in 100-plus countries, more than 2,100 full-time employees and $223 billion in held assets, according to the company.

""Hopefully, Coinbase going public and having its direct listing is going to be viewed as kind of a landmark moment for the crypto space,"" CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC in April, when the company went public. ""People no longer need to be scared of it like in the early days."" While the cryptocurrency exchange company has grown rapidly, complaints have continued to arise. Since 2016, Coinbase users have filed more than 11,000 complaints against Coinbase with the Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, mostly related to customer service. Former employees told CNBC the company's customer service practices shifted over time, with representatives struggling to keep up with demand.

Money vanished

The Vidovics' account had risen to $168,596 on April 28 when the hacking occurred, according to account statements the Vidovics shared with CNBC. That amount was essentially wiped out, with only a $587.15 balance shown the next day.

Like the Vidovics, Ben, a Virginia resident who asked that his last name be withheld, said he saw thousands of dollars vanish. He logged onto his Coinbase app in March, verifying his identity with two-factor authentication, but over a four-minute stretch almost $35,000 in various coins disappeared from his account, he said. In a response to his frantic email, Coinbase told Ben his computer had been hacked and there wasn't anything the company could do. ""I really am baffled,"" he said. ""It just seems to me that Coinbase did absolutely zero research and just said, 'Hey, yeah, sorry.'"" The CFPB responded to one of Ben's ensuing complaints with an answer from Coinbase's Regulatory Response Team. The email noted that transactions on the blockchain are irrevocable and said Coinbase's insurance policy does not cover theft from individual accounts. ""There is no credible or supportable evidence that the compromise of your login credentials was the fault of Coinbase,"" the message said. ""As a result, Coinbase is unable to reimburse you for your alleged losses."" Eventually, the company sent a $200 credit, telling Ben, ""your Coinbase experience and your wait for a response to your formal complaint was not up to our standards."" Experts say SIM swapping, where fraudsters seize control of a victim's phone number and SIM card through their phone company, is to blame for many of the cryptocurrency thefts. ""The problem with SIM swapping and cryptocurrency is the moment you lose access to your cell phone, professional hackers will steal all of your money in less than 30 minutes,"" said David Silver, an attorney who focuses on cryptocurrency.

Silver, whose firm represents the Vidovics, said the top complaints from potential clients are getting locked out of their cryptocurrency exchange platform account and SIM swaps. ""Most people who contact me would tell you it's poor customer service,"" Silver said. ""They're being almost victimized twice. Because they themselves have almost no ability to contact Coinbase and deal with them directly, they're forced to retain professionals."" Etay Maor, senior director of security strategy for cybersecurity company Cato Networks, said he's seen cybercriminals on the dark web discussing how to break into accounts, including those of Coinbase users. Once hackers break into Coinbase accounts, they put them up for sale on the dark web, according to Maor. He said while credit cards sell for a few dollars, hacked Coinbase accounts can sell for $100 to $150. ""These exchanges have to invest heavily, invest in security if they want to take it seriously, just like the banks have done and have learned the hard way,"" Maor said. Account takeovers are on law enforcement's radar. ""When the attacker withdraws those funds from the exchange, that's not a transaction that you can take back,"" Ali Comolli, a management and program analyst at the FBI, told CNBC.

Comolli said the FBI tries to help victims of account takeovers recover their stolen money. ""It's obviously a huge impact on the victims, which is incredibly difficult for them,"" Comolli said. After a review of Coinbase's complaints, the Better Business Bureau in March determined the company has a ""pattern of complaints from customers who state they are locked out of their accounts, even after providing required information or updates."" The organization has received 1,128 complaints in the past three years, according to its website. BBB said it sent a letter to Coinbase in order to address the customers' complaints and receive feedback from any implemented improvements. The group has ""not heard a response from this business, about the situation, pattern of complaints for the last three years,"" Alma Galvan, a marketing and communication manager with the organization, said in an email to CNBC. Some customers with lost funds turn to social media to seek help from Coinbase or find community with other disgruntled users. Members of a 941-person Facebook group called ""Coinbase Corruption/Scandal Awareness Group"" update the page with their struggles to recoup money and accounts. One poster referred to the group as a ""sad party,"" and several have brainstormed new places to report their complaints and new methods to pressure Coinbase into making them whole. Complaints abound on Reddit and Twitter as well, where the company's support accounts often publicly reply to the messages, sometimes writing that they have ""escalated"" the issue to an appropriate team. The Coinbase Support account on Twitter also posts live updates about changes and temporary errors on the exchange platform.

Struggling to keep pace

As the company has scaled into its massive size, customer service practices have changed, former Coinbase employees told CNBC. In Coinbase's early years, employees spoke with customers through a live help chat. Jason Rose, who worked part-time in customer service at Coinbase from 2014 until 2016, said many customers asked for reassurance about cryptocurrency. ""They need that touch of somebody being there while they're going through this complex transaction,"" he said. When Rose worked at Coinbase, he said live chat acted as a sort of ""release valve"" for complaints, particularly helpful in moments of crypto volatility. As the company grew, Rose said, his role changed. Coinbase started a repository of answers to frequently asked questions in order to automate its customer service. Rose said when he left in 2016 Coinbase was starting to phase out live chat. ""The decision to do that was disastrous because the time that it took to respond back to emails took a lot longer than it would for a live chat. So, we went back to the email box, taking five days to complete a problem that could have been solved in a few minutes,"" he said. Jacques Reulet also fielded customer issues and said it was hard to keep up. ""We were very diligent about making sure that everyone who wrote in got a response, but things were getting a little unresponsive towards the end [of my time there],"" said Reulet, who worked in operations and compliance at Coinbase from 2014 to 2015. ""The sheer scale at which the company was growing was a lot to handle. I didn't see that we were keeping up."" On Jan. 15, Coinbase acknowledged that many new and existing customers are experiencing delays in their response time. ""We recognize this is frustrating. This is not the experience we want for you, our customers,"" said Casper Sorensen, vice president of customer experience, in a blog post. A July blog post announced the company's intent to roll out live chat messaging and phone support this year, as well as to expand its customer support team. The customer service issue also came up on an earnings call earlier this month. ""So proud to report that we are doing much better [with customer service], but there's always more to do,"" said CEO Armstrong. ""We've increased the headcount five times or so since January, beginning of this year, working on support specifically."" Coinbase, which declined repeated requests from CNBC for an on-camera interview, instead said in an email, ""Over the years, we've consistently updated our customer support offerings to help us scale. In early 2020, we moved to email as our primary channel of support. Many of our customer inquiries require our agents to conduct a significant amount of research to resolve the issue. And, to avoid long wait times, communicating asynchronously via email was the preferred method. However, we recognize that customers want real-time support, and that's why we're rolling out phone support for ATOs this month and live messaging for all customers later this year."" Asked about the number of customer service complaints, the company said: ""Over the past several years, our customer base grew exponentially. We grew from 43+ million users at the end of 2020 to 68+ million registered users, as of June 30, 2021. Through all this growth, some of our customers unfortunately experienced challenges and delays reaching our support team, which resulted in a negative impact for some of our customers. Improving our customer experience remains a top priority for Coinbase."" The company would not disclose how many customers' accounts have been taken over by fraudsters or the total amount it has refunded customers as a result of hacks. It added that since customers have a two-factor authentication, at the minimum, to access their accounts, only ""a small number (less than .01%) of our customers have been impacted by account takeovers."" Marci Preble, a California-based marketer, said Coinbase did credit her account the approximate amount of her original investment. But she said that was after months of a nightmare of what seemed like endless emails.

Aussies made more than $10,000 in profit from their cryptocurrency investments in the past 12 months — the equivalent to nearly two months of the average Australian salary.

More than three quarters of Aussies made a profit from their crypto investments over the last year too, according to research from YouGov, with the average profit adding up to $10,662.

But more than one in five Aussie cryptocurrency holders said they made a massive amount of profits worth over $30,000, the survey found.

Interestingly, Aussie parents with children under 18 at home were the most likely to make money from their cryptocurrency trading, with 86 per cent reporting a profit that added up on average to $12,428.

The crypto market ran hot over the last year, said Swyftx head of strategic partnerships, Tommy Honan, an Australian cryptocurrency exchange with more than 320,000 customers, which commissioned the survey.

“So even though we’ve just come out of a dip in the market we’re still seeing a lot of Aussies reporting profits on their trades over the last 12 months,” he noted.

“Aussie millennials and Gen Xers saw especially big returns, with around one in five saying they made more than $20,000 over the last year from cryptocurrency. Aussie mums and dads appear to have been especially successful, as well as men in general and crypto users who report a strong or some understanding of the market.”

Men achieved an average $11,357 profit on their crypto over the last 12 months, while women achieved an average of $9,176, the survey revealed.

In terms of location, crypto users in Brisbane were the most likely to report a profit with 83 per cent making money, followed by Sydney and Melbourne at 76 per cent and then Perth.

Mr Honan said he expected to see further improvements in the market this year following a market fall in May and June.

“Experienced investors have been buying the dip in the expectation that Bitcoin could hit the US $100,000 price by the end of the year,” he said.

But if you’re new to crypto, Mr Honan said it’s best to do your research before buying.

“The group who were least likely to report a profit on their crypto holdings over the last year were people who said they had little or no understanding of the market,” he said.

“At the moment, this is a relatively small proportion of crypto users in the country, just 16 per cent report having little or no understanding. But for this group and anyone who wants to grow their confidence, it really is essential to do your research.”

“Pro tips are to research the team behind any digital assets you are thinking of buying, and also look at indicators like the size of a coin’s market and its liquidity.”

Financial regulators around the world have begun to scrutinise cryptocurrency as they investigate implementing regulations.

In the UK, the financial watchdog has warned that people should be prepared to lose all their money if investing in cryptocurrency, while it also banned trading exchange Binance.

Poly Network, a platform in the decentralized finance or ""DeFi"" space, was hit by a major attack this month which saw the hacker, or hackers, steal more than $600 million worth of digital tokens. The thief exploited a vulnerability in Poly Network's code which allowed them to transfer the funds to their own accounts.

In a strange twist, the Poly Network hacker didn't run off with the haul. Instead, they opened a dialogue with the organization that was targeted, promising to return all the funds. And, sure enough, the hacker gave back nearly all of the money — with the exception of $33 million of tether, or USDT, which was frozen by its issuers.

There was a catch, however. More than $200 million of assets was trapped in an account that required passwords from both Poly Network and the hacker. For some time, the hacker refused to hand over their password, simply saying they would only do so once ""everyone is ready.""

Poly Network pleaded with the hacker, which it is calling ""Mr. White Hat,"" to return the remaining funds. The platform promised to grant the unidentified person a $500,000 bounty for helping it identify a flaw in its systems, and even offered them a job as ""chief security advisor.""

Now, the hacker has finally given Poly Network access to the final tranche of stolen funds. In a blog post Monday, the firm said Mr. White Hat shared the so-called private key needed to regain control of the remaining assets.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929924-1629309517996-gettyimages-959428194-bs_4561.jpeg?v=1629309551',)",none

PayPal launches crypto buying and selling in the UK



PayPal Holdings Inc will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week, the company said on Monday. The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class. With over 403 million active accounts globally, the company is one of the largest mainstream financial companies to offer consumers access to cryptocurrencies. It launched crypto buying and selling in the US in early 2021 and enabled customers to use their digital coin holdings to shop at the millions of merchants on its network. Read details here.

The bitcoin price last night broke above $50,000 per bitcoin for the first time since May. Meanwhile, double-digit gains among other major cryptocurrencies—including ethereum, Binance's BNB, cardano, and Ripple's XRP—helped the combined crypto market value climb to over $2.1 trillion, up from $1.1 trillion in July.

Ahead of the latest bitcoin and crypto price surge higher, a poll of mostly banking executives found most think bitcoin and digital assets could replace fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar within the next five to 10 years—a shift described as ""seismic.""

""We uncovered several findings that illustrate a seismic shift in financial services resulting from the evolution of blockchain-based digital assets,"" consultants led by Linda Pawczuk at the accountancy company Deloitte wrote alongside a report that found 76% of finance professionals think bitcoin and crypto could serve as an alternative to or replacement for fiat currencies in the next five to 10 years.

A strong majority (81%) of the almost 1,300 executives questioned think blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, is broadly scalable and has already achieved mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, 73% think their company should adopt crypto and blockchain or risk losing competitive advantage.

""The foundation of banking has been fundamentally outlived and financial services industry players must redefine themselves and find innovative ways to create economic growth in the future of money,"" Pawczuk, who heads up Deloitte's global blockchain and digital assets practice, said in a statement alongside the report.

This year, Wall Street banks from Goldman Sachs GS to JPMorgan JPM have begun rolling out bitcoin and crypto services to their clients as central banks around the world experiment with blockchain-based central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

The cryptocurrency traded at roughly $49,400 by the afternoon session, still shy of its all-time high above $64,000 set in April.

The space has seen a boost in the past week on increasing adoption. PayPal said Monday it would open its platform in the U.K. to crypto buying and selling, and Coinbase said last week that it would buy $500 million in cryptocurrency on its balance sheet.

Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Capital, is a bitcoin bull but remains wary of jumping in right here.

""I think it needs to be in your portfolio, but is $50,000 the place to be buying it? I wouldn't chase it,"" Baruch told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Monday.

Bitcoin fell below $30,000 during a summer sell-off. Weakness in recent months was largely tied to a regulatory crackdown in China wherein some mining operations were forced to close. Since a June low of $28,600, it has rallied 73%.

In a separate email to CNBC, Baruch said he owns bitcoin but began to trim his holdings once it bounced back to $45,000 — roughly the same level as its 200-day moving average and a 50% retracement level measured from its April peak and its June low. He said that level could prove a good entry point if bitcoin falls back to it.

""Again, I think it's a great space to be in, but don't chase it just because you see $50,000 in the headlines. Pick your spots and stick to your game plan,"" he said.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106898939-16239476502021-06-17t162640z_286660568_rc2g2o9bp75h_rtrmadp_0_cryto-currency-usa-politics.jpeg?v=1629754707',)",none

The Japanese Liquid exchange reported the unfolding events in a series of tweets.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

The company revealed the wallet addresses which were used by the hacker to steal the funds, and temporarily froze all activity on the exchange while assessing the extent of the hack’s impact.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX) and Ripple (XRP) were the main assets targeted in the theft.

Coin mixers that randomly pool and clean cryptocurrencies in a non-custodial fashion have been used by the hackers to get away with almost half the stolen assets. According to chain data, 6,000 Ethereum (ETH) worth a staggering $20m has already been cycled through mixers into new anonymous wallets.

Uniswap was the decentralised platform used to swap ERC20 tokens stolen in the heist for more liquid Ether.

Authorities are working to recover the remaining 9,600 ETH which the hacker is yet to move from their wallet. The Japanese exchange remains hopeful the Ether valued at $32m can be recovered.

Progress was made over the weekend according to updates from Liquid on its corporate blog, the company further announced that it had already significantly ramped up network security to ensure protections against future robberies by crypto gangsters.

A wake up call for the industry

Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technical Officer at the Bitfinex derivatives exchange, pointed to the latest hack as a wake up call for the industry. Using the event as an opportunity to suggest a more unified approach with exchanges and trading platforms working together to increase security measures in crypto.

“Today’s hack at the Liquid exchange is the latest security breach in the digital token space,” he said.

Story continues

“This is another warning, if one were needed, to everyone.

“The ingenuity of bad actors seeking to breach the security systems of exchanges and trading platforms will not abate. It is therefore imperative that we work together as an industry with all exchanges remaining in a perpetual state of vigilance against such threats.

“While the safeguarding of customer funds is of course an exchange’s number one priority, holders of cryptocurrencies should take all steps necessary to ensure that their funds are safe.

“These include ensuring that they have a cold wallet, two factor authentication, notification messages when funds are withdrawn, and avoiding public WiFi.”

LONDON — PayPal is launching its cryptocurrency service in the U.K. The U.S. online payments giant said Monday it would let British customers buy, hold and sell digital currencies, starting this week. It marks the the first international expansion of PayPal's crypto product, which first launched in the U.S. in October last year. ""It has been doing really well in the U.S.,"" Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal's general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies, told CNBC. ""We expect it's going to do well in the U.K."" PayPal's crypto feature lets customers buy or sell bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum or litecoin with as little as £1. Users can also track crypto prices in real-time, and find educational content on the market. Like the U.S. version of the product, PayPal is relying on Paxos, a New York-regulated digital currency company, to enable crypto buying and selling in the U.K. PayPal said it has engaged with relevant U.K. regulators to launch the service.

A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's financial services watchdog, was not immediately available for comment on the announcement.

Growing adoption

PayPal's crypto service is similar to one from U.K. fintech firm Revolut. As is the case with Revolut, PayPal users can't move their crypto holdings outside the app. Although Revolut recently started testing a feature that lets users withdraw bitcoin to their own personal wallets. PayPal says its foray into crypto is about making it easier for people to participate in the market. ""The tokens and coins have been around for a while but you had to be a relatively sophisticated user to be able to access that,"" da Ponte said. ""Having that on a platform like ours makes a really good entry point."" The payments processor is one of many large companies taking a leap into the mostly unregulated world of cryptocurrencies. Despite ongoing concerns about price volatility, consumer protection and potential money laundering in the industry, major firms including Mastercard, Tesla and Facebook have been warming to crypto lately.

Bitcoin, the world's biggest digital currency, hit a record high of nearly $65,000 in April before tumbling below $30,000 in July as Chinese regulators extended a crackdown on the market. It has since recovered to a price of over $50,000. While PayPal started with crypto trading, the company is betting digital currencies will take a greater role in e-commerce in the long run. Earlier this year, PayPal started letting U.S. consumers use crypto to pay at millions of its online merchants globally. The firm also expanded crypto buying and selling to Venmo, its popular mobile wallet. ""We definitely have ambitions to continue to expand the product range in the U.S., the U.K. and other markets,"" da Ponte said. ""We are very deliberate about starting with initial functionality, and then we'll see where the market is going to take us. Different markets have different appetite for products.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929876-1629304059932-Pay_Pal-26.jpg?v=1629306031',)",none

It's been a good few days for bitcoin investors. The digital token is trading at nearly $50,000, its highest point in months. And many people who've stayed on the sidelines are probably wondering yet again: Is it time to buy the cryptocurrency? Before you put your money into the still highly volatile asset, however, there are three helpful things to consider, according to financial and behavioral experts.

1. Suspecting it's a bubble won't save you

Many investors know what a bubble is: It's what happens when an asset's price far exceeds its real value. And many smart people have expressed concern that bitcoin is a bubble. Still, many have invested in the currency with little caution despite their suspicions that its price is unmoored from its value.

It's common for people to buy assets even when they know they're overvalued, ""because they expect prices to go even higher,"" said Bruce Mizrach, an economics professor at Rutgers University's Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences. And, he said, ""they all believe that they can exit before the bubble crashes."" Just remember: That's what everyone else is thinking. ""By the time most individual investors get into a rising investment, it's often too late,"" said Kent Baker, a finance professor at American University.

2. FOMO often backfires

Stories of crypto-millionaires. People buying houses, thanks to bitcoin. How could you not be experiencing a fear of missing out? Investors often fall prey to the social bias of ""herding,"" Baker said. They do what the crowd does, believing that everyone else must know more than they do and that there's safety in numbers. We can't all lose our all money, they may think.

""Generally, such investors are wrong on both counts,"" Baker said. In reality, the other people ""in the crowd,"" are similarly swayed by the same illusions.

3. There's just still so much we don't know","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106931701-1629727861382-gettyimages-1324486089-60cb1c2a22ab9023d36d30a4_1624174305.jpeg?v=1629727952',)",none

It's no secret that Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, loves bitcoin. He has touted it as the most important project in his lifetime to work on, and Square, his digital payments company, bought over $170 million worth of bitcoin earlier this year. Now, the billionaire CEO is mining it, too. ""I'm trying mining with @compass_mining,"" Dorsey tweeted on Tuesday. Compass Mining is a service that hosts, supplies and operates cryptocurrency mining rigs for individual miners who do not want to worry about purchasing and maintaining mining equipment themselves. Bitcoin operates on a proof of work model, where miners must compete to solve complex puzzles in order to validate transactions. The process isn't easy: It requires a lot of energy and computer power, which isn't cheap. The computers themselves, along with other equipment, can also be very expensive.

2. Robinhood says dogecoin accounted for 62% of crypto revenue in Q2

In its first earnings report since its IPO last month, Robinhood said that cryptocurrency accounted for more than half of all transaction-based sales in the second quarter. Dogecoin, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that started as a joke, accounted for 62% of its crypto revenue, Robinhood reported. In total, its revenue from crypto transactions was $233 million in the second quarter.

3. Coinbase is buying $500 million in crypto on its balance sheet

On Thursday, Coinbase announced it is buying $500 million in crypto on its balance sheet and will allocate 10% of its quarterly profits into a crypto assets portfolio. Coinbase plans to invest in ""Ethereum, proof of stake assets, DeFi tokens, and many other crypto assets supported for trading on our platform,"" company finance chief Alesia Haas said in a blog post.

4. The world’s second-largest stablecoin is changing its makeup

In a blog post on Sunday, Centre, the consortium that developed stablecoin USD Coin, announced it's changing the makeup of its reserves once again. This time, its reserves will consist of cash and U.S. Treasury bonds. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are supposed to be pegged to reserve assets like fiat currency. While the developers behind USD Coin previously said it was backed 1:1 by cash, it was revealed in July that cash made up just over 60% of its reserves. The other 40% was backed by debt securities and bonds. USD Coin is the second-largest stablecoin, with $27 billion worth of coins in circulation.

5. Hacker behind $600 million crypto heist returns all stolen funds

Poly Network, a decentralized finance, or DeFi, platform was hacked earlier this month, with over $600 million worth of crypto stolen. The hacker exploited a vulnerability in the platform's code, which allowed them to transfer the stolen funds. But as of Monday, Poly Network has recovered all of the stolen funds. ""At this point, all the user assets that were transferred out during the incident have been fully recovered,"" Poly Network said a blog post on Monday. ""We are in the process of returning full asset control to users as swiftly as possible."" The person claiming to be the hacker said the theft was simply done ""for fun.""

2021-08-23,The Economic Times,Will cryptocurrency ever be accepted as a ‘good’ asset class?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/will-cryptocurrency-ever-be-accepted-as-a-good-asset-class/articleshow/85554912.cms,"MUMBAI: The birth of cryptocurrency in 2008 was based on the thought that one day it could act as a common monetary system that would help replace the inefficiencies of the current centralised system around the world.The idea of an internet cash system, built on the then nascent blockchain technology, hoped to allow people to transact with each other without a third-party to verify it, like in a central bank. The peer-to-peer system, born in the midst of the global financial crisis, solved problems that troubled cryptographers since 1992.Fast forward to 2021. Today, more people see cryptocurrencies as a tool for investment rather than a currency. In fact, the view that a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin could become a widely accepted currency is now confined to just Bitcoin maximalists.In India, where cryptocurrency adoption is rising fast, businesses involved in the space are breaking away from the ideas of Satoshi Nakamoto — the pseudonym of the person who developed Bitcoin — to paint cryptocurrencies as an asset class. They are trying to convince the government and the monetary authority against banning this form of digital cash.“There is a big misunderstanding… you can’t have Bitcoin (a deflationary asset) compete with the rupee (an inflationary monetary system),” crypto exchange WazirX’s CEO Nischal Shetty had said in February at the ETMarkets Conclave. “You can’t use Bitcoin for everyday transactions because of its high cost.”But does a cryptocurrency even have the attributes to be a “good” asset class?“Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West. This asset class is rife with fraud, scams and abuse in certain applications. There is a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced and complete information,” US Securities Exchange Commission head Gary Gensler said at a recent event.An asset class is defined as a group of instruments that have similar characteristics and are governed by the same regulations.According to Chakri Lokapriya of TCG Asset Management, a good asset class should have liquidity, stability, value and a low transaction cost. “An asset class that can display stability in most of those characteristics can be termed as a ‘good asset class!’” Lokapriya told ETMarkets.com.Even the most ardent supporters of cryptocurrencies have found it hard to deal with the inherent volatility of these instruments. Cryptocurrencies are often prone to flash crashes that could be due to a number of factors, such as a sudden exit of one large investor or systemic failures at cryptocurrency exchanges.While Bitcoin’s liquidity has improved markedly due to the introduction of bite-size coins called Satoshis, others remain vulnerable to sudden bouts of liquidity drying up. A major concern among cryptocurrency investors has been the large holdings among so-called whale investors, whose exit can create market crashes. Market risk, therefore, is one of the biggest vulnerabilities of owning cryptocurrencies.High transaction costs of trading in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is another factor that works against the asset class. Back in April, the average fee of transacting in Bitcoin was at an all-time high of $59 after China’s crackdown on the country's Bitcoin miners. High transaction fee is also one of the major arguments used by traditional investors to discard cryptocurrencies’ utility as a medium of exchange.Bitcoin’s high transaction fee also emits from the high cost of energy that miners face to keep their mining farms running 24 hours a day. According to some reports, the amount of power used to mine Bitcoin is more than the electricity consumption of Argentina.As for cryptocurrencies’ role as a store of value, the jury is still out. While a Bitcoin today is worth Rs. 36 lakh, many still doubt its ability to act as a stable store of value because of the high volatility associated with it. Bitcoin has been equated with digital gold given that its supply is scarce by design.Sceptics such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb say the true value of Bitcoin is zero. The author and risk analyst said in June that Bitcoin can neither be a short-term or long-term store of value, cannot operate as a reliable hedge against inflation, and “worst of all, does not constitute, not even remotely, a tail protection vehicle for catastrophic episodes”.Yet, many institutional investors and Fortune 500 companies are adopting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a hedge against their expectations of high future inflation as well as black swan events like the Covid-19 pandemic. Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy have already converted part or all of their balance sheet cash into Bitcoin. Recently, a Texas-based biotech company converted its cash into Bitcoin to avoid “overreach from banks”.Technical factors aside, one of the biggest hurdles in accepting cryptocurrencies as a good asset class is because of the regulatory uncertainty. The US SEC has already demanded powers from the Congress to regulate both crypto tokens and the entire decentralised finance framework. In India, crypto investors and crypto entrepreneurs want the government to regulate the industry so as to allow innovation to thrive and address misgivings about the asset’s role in money laundering, fraud and terrorism financing.Wealth managers and advisors speak of high networth investors willing to invest in cryptocurrencies through the right channels but unable to do so out of fear of prosecution.In some countries, regulators have shown a willingness to regulate cryptocurrencies as an asset class and allow asset management companies to launch instruments such as exchange-traded funds, crypto-backed bonds and the likes that provide access to common investors in a risk-controlled environment.Perhaps, among the many problems that cryptocurrencies have to tackle to be acknowledged as a good and viable asset class, regulation could be the first step in the journey.With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman suggesting a more calibrated approach to cryptocurrencies in the proposed cryptocurrency law, investors will hope the death of a utopian-style currency will give birth to the foundation of a stable asset class.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85554970,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76298,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Euronews,Could Cardano’s 'green' cryptocurrency ADA take over Bitcoin and Ethereum?,https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/23/could-cardano-s-green-cryptocurrency-ada-take-over-bitcoin-and-etherium,"The little known cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) has come out of nowhere to become the third-largest after Bitcoin and Ethereum following a recent price surge as blockchain enthusiasts look for more climate-friendly options.

Cardano’s price has gone up by more than 36 per cent in the last week and its market capitalisation stands at $90.60 billion (€76 billion), according to crypto website CoinMarketCap.

What is Cardano and what are the reasons for its success? Here’s everything you need to know.

What is Cardano?

Cardano is a blockchain platform and it has its own internal cryptocurrency called ADA.

The tokens are named after Augusta ""Ada"" King, or Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century British countess known for her work on a theoretical computation engine. She is largely regarded as the first computer programmer and is the daughter of the poet Lord Byron.

ADA is named after 'Ada lovelace', a 19th-century British countess known for her work on a theoretical computation engine. Cardano website

Cardano was established in 2015 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and was launched in 2017. Since then, the token has returned 7,080 per cent to investors.

Cardano is the largest cryptocurrency to use a proof of stake blockchain model, which is considered a greener alternative.

As crypto enthusiasts become more aware of the environmental impact of cryptos, Cardano has an upper hand over Bitcoin and Ethereum, and this could be one reason for its recent success.

Recent figures from Bitcoinenergyconsumption.com show Bitcoin’s estimated annual emissions is over 57 million tonnes of CO2 per year, which is about the same annual carbon footprint as a small European country.

Meanwhile, Iran and China temporarily banned all crypto mining this summer because computers used in the process were sapping too much electricity and causing power cuts.

Proof of stake works by randomly allocating coins to users, who put up coins for collateral. This differs from the proof of work mechanism - used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum - which requires a global network of computers to run at the same time when a transaction takes place.

This method is designed to encourage increased computing effort for transactions, which uses much more energy than proof of stake.

On its website, Cardano says: ""We have changed science. We have changed what it means to build global systems and sustainable models of exchange and governance.

""We, alongside our community and partners, are defining a new future: a decentralised future without intermediaries, in which power is returned to the individual"".

What are the reasons for Cardano’s success?

Over the last two weeks, the cryptocurrency market has been rallying. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been leading the wave but 'altcoins' - alternative digital currencies to Bitcoin - have also gathered pace in the price race.

Cardano’s price surge came after it announced a major upgrade called Alonzo, which will launch in September.

Alonzo will introduce smart contracts to the blockchain. Smart contracts are programmes stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They are typically used to automate the execution of an agreement and will allow Cardano to deploy their own smart contracts and pave the way for its own decentralised applications (dApps).

Another reason for Cardano’s surge is that from August 25, its coin will be listed on Japan’s exchange after authorisation by the country, which is considered to have one of the strictest criteria for entering the market.

It means Cardano’s ADA will join the elite coins of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin in Japan where it will be put to the test.","('https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/00/50/90/1000x563_cmsv2_510d29c0-64e7-5c4d-9e5e-80b8de1361ed-6005090.jpg',)",none

Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) is back (baby). After months languishing in a $30,000 to $40,000 price channel, the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies surged past $50,000 per coin on Monday. What may surprise you, though, is that other cryptocurrencies are doing even better.

Here's how prices have changed over the past 24 hours (as of 10 a.m. EDT) for several of the biggest names in cryptocurrency, according to the price trackers at Coindesk:

Bitcoin CRYPTO:BTC)

Ethereum 's CRYPTO:ETH)

's XRP CRYPTO:XRP)

And Dogecoin CRYPTO:DOGE)

So what

Today is the first day in three months that Bitcoin has broken the $50,000 barrier. But while Bitcoin's surge is probably at least part of the reason other cryptocurrencies are following along, this is still more a description than an explanation of what's happening today.

So what else is going on in the cryptocurrency world today?

Well, as CNBC reports, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) just launched its cryptocurrency service in the United Kingdom, permitting users to buy, sell, and keep crypto in their PayPal accounts. CNBC notes that this is PayPal's first major expansion of its cryptocurrency services outside the U.S -- but probably won't be its last. As the market for Bitcoin grows, it makes sense that the demand for and price of Bitcoin would grow with it.

Now what

Now, at the same time, The Wall Street Journal points out that ""cryptocurrency's surge"" around the globe is starting to catch the attention of regulators. However, the Journal also notes that ""coordinated crypto oversight seems limited in the U.S., Europe and Asia"" so far. While regulators are ""scrambling to catch up ... it won't be easy ... to rein in a rebellious industry that has adopted the tech world's blueprint for aggressively deploying new products to quickly amass users,"" the Journal says.

In the U.S., new SEC chairman Gary Gensler (and others) have called for heightened regulation of the cryptocurrency market, calling it ""the Wild West"" and urging it be reined in. In Europe, regulators seem most concerned about ""policing fraud"" and ""ensuring transparency,"" observes the Journal -- but also ""protecting the sovereignty"" of nation states and the currencies they favor. Meanwhile in Asia, China is taking a sort of schizophrenic approach to regulation, on the one hand ""rooting out cryptocurrency-related activities"" initiated by others -- but on the other hand trying to create its own digital currency controlled by the state.

So is this good news or bad news? As I've argued previously, although cryptocurrency fans might on first reaction be inclined to cheer the lack of ""coordinated crypto oversight,"" more coordinated regulation might actually be a good thing for the crypto market, moderating panic-inducing price swings, and bringing a bit of predictability and -- dare we say it? -- safety to investing in cryptocurrency.

As big players like PayPal enter this market, don't be too surprised if you see them start lobbying for regulation themselves.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640365/gold-bitcoin-symbol-on-a-stock-chart.jpg',)",none

CAS is the native coin of the Cashaa platform, which offers functions such as speedy processing, discounted set up fees, cheaper international wire cost, rebate in exchange and transaction fees.

Cashaa aims to help crypto businesses access banking infrastructure, and the neo-bank has started rolling out personal accounts across the globe, starting with India.

For this, the neo-bank has tied up with Polygon to reduce the ethereum network fee, which is becoming a bottleneck for small transactions on the network, while at the same time for the enhanced security provided by the network.

Using the bridge, CAS holders will be able to leverage Polygon’s full-stack scaling to minimize transaction fees while transacting with CAS and gain access to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem. Moreover, CAS holders will also be able to stake CAS on the Polygon network to earn up to 30% annually, which will be rewarded in CAS and MATIC tokens.

Matic, is the native currency of Polygon (formerly Matic Network), which was co-founded in 2017 by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun.

“Cashaa has been continuously scaling and now entering into giving personal accounts to increase the adoption of its CAS token, which requires cheaper transaction cost. Association with Polygon is another step towards the same,"" said Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO, Cashaa.

Cashaa will be implementing MATIC tokens in the following products: Cashaa Earn, which earns up to 14% annual interest on deposits; Cashaa Lend, a loan solution of 0% interest rates on cryptocurrency-collateralized fiat loans on bitcoin, Cashaa, ether and matic.

In the last two years, Cashaa has onboarded more than 250 crypto-native businesses who transacted over $1 billion using the Cashaa solution.

2021-08-23,The Guardian,PayPal to allow UK users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/23/paypal-uk-buy-sell-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-ethereum-litecoin,"PayPal is to allow users in the UK to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies through the payment platform for the first time.

The firm said it would allow customers to choose from four types of cryptocurrency – bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash – and that the service would be available via the PayPal app and its website.

A crypto tab will be added to the platform, showing real-time currency prices as well as offering educational content to help answer common questions and learn more about cryptocurrencies, including the potential risks, PayPal said.

The payment company said it hoped that the move to embrace the currency would help improve knowledge and understanding of it.

Cryptocurrencies remain controversial because of their lack of regulation and volatile value fluctuations, and some critics have raised concerns about the anonymity offered to users as part of transactions, arguing the currencies are used by cybercriminals to hide their activities.

Jose Fernandez da Ponte, the vice-president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said the firm’s service could help introduce more people to the technology and how it works, helping to better shape the role the currencies could play in the future.

“The pandemic has accelerated digital change and innovation across all aspects of our lives, including the digitisation of money and greater consumer adoption of digital financial services,” he said.

“Our global reach, digital payments expertise, and knowledge of consumer and businesses, combined with rigorous security and compliance controls provides us the unique opportunity, and the responsibility, to help people in the UK to explore cryptocurrency.

“We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce.”

PayPal confirmed the service would begin rolling out this week and would be available to all eligible customers within the next few weeks.

The firm has launched a similar service in the US, which allows users to make purchases at participating businesses using cryptocurrencies – a feature that has not yet been confirmed for release in the UK.

Laith Khalaf, the head of investment analysis at the financial firm AJ Bell, said he expected the service to be added in the UK at some point soon.

Khalaf said there were signs investors were “leapfrogging traditional forms of savings and diving in at the deep end by investing in crypto”, and that the City regulator was concerned about the potential for consumer harm posed by volatile pricing.

“An alarming statistic is that 14% of UK crypto buyers funded their purchases using debt, according to figures released by the FCA in June. While many are no doubt using crypto as a bit of harmless fun with small amounts of money they can afford to lose, some consumers are at risk of getting sucked in and spat out by the crypto craze,” he said.

“PayPal’s presence is positive in that it is a high-profile, publicly listed company, which is already subject to regulatory scrutiny. But overall the crypto craze remains a worry for consumer advocates and regulators.”","('https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc3755117074a7ad081b2f74a3d5223732e973c/0_300_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=60b96ea8c4342dd260580796b02553dd',)",none

In a press release dated August 19, Bitcoin Suisse announced the integrated service named WL Crypto Payments. This omni-channel payment solution will allow all merchants using the Worldline payment services to accept payments in Bitcoin and Ether. The merchants will be able to accept payments in Bitcoin and Ether on point-of-sale (POS) and e-commerce services.

To use this payment service, merchants only need to download the WL Crypto Payments mobile app. They can also install the Worldline payment plugin for their online store.

Clients willing to pay through digital coins may use the mobile cryptocurrency wallet application for this purpose. Prices displayed in Swiss Francs (CHF) will be shown in real-time Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) value, according to the options that a client chooses. The price, to be paid in cryptocurrency, can get confirmed to the merchant instantly.

The transaction is claimed to be safe from volatility risks, as it will be securely converted into CHF after payment is confirmed.

This payment solution was successfully tested in a pilot programme before being rolled out to all Worldline merchants in Switzerland. Worldline and Bitcoin Suisse first collaborated over crypto payments in November 2019.

According to a 2019 press release, the companies intended to reinforce the ""leading position of Switzerland as a strong center in the crypto-financial services industry."" Switzerland houses over 800 companies that offer services or develop solutions for crypto and blockchain companies and is a bustling hub of cryptocurrency growth.

Worldline Switzerland MD Marc Schluep said that this project stood up to their goal of bringing “tangible value to merchants across the globe and to facilitate smooth and modern payments in all the markets"" the firm operates in.

Bitcoin Suisse CEO Dr. Arthur Vayloyan called it a “historic milestone for crypto adoption in Switzerland and beyond,” and added that this step proved yet again that Switzerland was the leader in collaborative innovation and a pioneer in the crypto and blockchain industry.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_ether_stock_unsplash_1629707389109.jpg',)",none

It's been a turbulent few months for cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin, which hit an all-time high of nearly $90,794 in April, plummeted to as low as $40,228 in June after China escalated its crackdown on digital currencies.

Bitcoin, which had been hovering between $41,905 and $55,873 for many weeks, began to rise out of its slump last month, when major tech giants signaled — or appeared to signal — their support for digital currencies.

In July, Amazon posted a job opening for a digital currency and blockchain product lead, sending cryptocurrencies soaring.

At the current price of $2.82, Cardano’s market capitalisation stands $90.60 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Its price has gone up by nearly 11.3 percent in the last 24 hours. Its year to date is also much higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum as it is currently at 1,444 percent.

The cryptocurrency market has been rallying in the last two weeks with the total market capital surging past $2 trillion. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been leading after they plummeted in mid May. Meanwhile, new altcoins have also rallied in the price race.

Cardano is a proof of stake blockchain and is considered a direct rival of Ethereum and Solana. Its recent price surge came after the upcoming ‘Alonzo’ upgrade was recently announced.

The update which will be launched in September is expected to introduce smart contracts to the blockchain. “It's an important moment, marking significant progress in the rollout of #smartcontracts on the #Cardano mainnet which is targeted for the end of August/early September,” the development team said in a Twitter post adding that it has begun test net as well.

The bullish trend of Cardano got a boost after the coin was authorised to list in Japan which is considered to have one of the ‘most demanding listing criteria worldwide’. It is scheduled to be listed on August 25, 2021. This listing places the native among the likes of elite coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin that are also traded on the Japanese exchange.

Cardano’s reputation as a “green coin” is what attracts cryptocurrency enthusiasts who want to engage with environmentally friendly and sustainable digital assets. This gives the coin an upper hand over Bitcoin and Ethereum that are not considered as efficient in energy consumption.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/06/cardano-cryptocurrency-770x433.jpg',)",none

The most popular cryptocurrency has been trading in the green with a market cap of more than $921 billion.With 76 lakh users, WazirX has witnessed a massive 2,648 per cent growth in user signups from tier 2 and 3 cities in the country, observing higher participation from women from smaller towns compared to their urban counterparts.The cryptocurrency exchange has clocked $21.8 billion in overall trading volume since January 2021.'We welcome the government's move on the cryptocurrency bill and wish that cryptocurrencies will not only become available for mainstream investors but also to those who have an inclination to try the new asset class. We already have our own self-regulatory code of conduct and best practices in place for our users,' Shetty told IANS.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last week that she is awaiting an approval from the Cabinet on the bill on cryptocurrency.The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has said it may come out with a model of central bank digital currency (CBDC) as early as the end of 2021. A CBDC is a virtual currency issued by the central bank and has a sovereign backing, unlike other digital currencies.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, however, has flagged his major concerns over cryptocurrencies to the government.In its circular on April 6, 2018, the central bank had prohibited banks from dealing in cryptocurrencies or offering any such service to the customers.The circular was challenged in the Supreme Court , which set aside the rules on March 4 last year.'A digital coin by the RBI will be the key step to popularise cryptocurrencies in India,' said Shetty.'With expanding Internet access in a mobile-first country, people can start trading at ease as no bank account would be needed. The settlement period is easier, faster and 24/7 with crypto,' he added.According to him, smaller towns are fast picking up on crypto which is spreading deeper into the tier 2, 3 and 4 cities.Tier 2 and 3 cities have driven almost 55 per cent of total user signups on WazirX in 2021, overtaking tier 1 cities which demonstrated a signup growth of 2,375 per cent.Moreover, women from these regions contribute to 65 per cent of the total signups by women from all over the country.'Crypto has immense potential to remove the financial barriers for rural India, and provide cheaper access to capital, more online jobs,' Shetty noted.Crypto assets are moving towards becoming mainstream with many brands around the world accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85556232,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-105105,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none

The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class.

With over 403 million active accounts globally, the San Jose, California-based company is one of the largest mainstream financial companies to offer consumers access to cryptocurrencies.

PayPal launched cryptocurrency buying and selling in the United States early this year, later enabling customers to use their digital coin holdings to shop at the millions of merchants on its network.

The company hoped its foray into the new asset class would encourage global use of virtual coins and prepare its network for new digital currencies that may be developed by corporations and central banks.

""We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support — and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce,"" Jose Fernandez da Ponte, vice president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said in a statement.

In the UK, PayPal's service will rival that of established cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global, as well as fintech startups such as Revolut.

Customers will be able to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash through their PayPal wallets online or on the mobile app. Bitcoin price in India as of August 23 at 10:57am IST was Rs. 38.46 lakhs. Ethereum price in India as of August 23 at 10:57am IST was Rs. 2.55 lakhs. Litecoin price in India as of August 23 at 10:57am IST was Rs. 14,520. Bitcoin cash price in India as of August 23 at 10:57am IST was Rs. 50,797.

The move comes as more established financial companies have started offering their clients, both consumers and institutions, access to digital assets, amid rising cryptocurrency prices.

Cryptocurrency is all the rage these days, and as it usually happens, malicious apps and hackers are here to take advantage of the ongoing crypto hype. These apps are designed to mislead innocent users into installing them on their smartphones.Google has identified eight such dangerous crypto apps on the Play Store and banned them.

These apps employed the usual “ get rich quick ” scheme to lure users into investing money in a ‘cloud mining service’ and reaping profits.“Despite these apps not being associated with cloud-mining operations or having any cryptocurrency-mining features, some of these apps prompt users to pay for increased cryptocurrency-mining capabilities via the apps’ in-app billing systems that range from $14.99 to as high as $189.99,” the Trend Micro report said.According to an analysis by security firm Trend Micro, the eight banned apps forced users to watch advertisements and have an average monthly fee of $115 (approx. ₹1,114).

Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, has suspended futures and derivatives products offerings across Europe, starting with Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Announcing the move, it said it was “taking proactive steps” towards harmonising crypto regulations. The move meant Binance users from these countries were prohibited from opening new futures or derivatives products accounts. But why exactly it took such a drastic step in an important, growing market? And Why is it facing intense regulatory pressure and scrutiny around the world?

Some countries have banned it and others have curtailed its operation. Many others have warned it to cease its “illegal” operations on their territories. Even in India, Binance-owned WazirX is under the radar of the Enforcement Directorate for alleged money laundering. The ED is probing allegations that Chinese-operated betting apps laundered a portion of funds through WazirX. The Indian exchange, however, said it is in compliance with all applicable laws.

Additionally, leading banking institutions and payment processors in the UK have begun to limit transfers to and from Binance because of “excessively high fraud rates”. The company is also said to be preparing to cut daily withdrawal limits from two Bitcoin to 0.06 BTC this month. Despite recent efforts to appease regulators, Binance was forced to cease trading and support for stock tokens like Tesla and Coinbase.

Earlier this year, the Thailand SEC filed a criminal complaint against Binance, while the Cayman Islands stated that the exchange was not allowed to conduct operations there. And the latest to raise a red flag over its operations is the Dutch central bank, saying the company was found not in compliance with the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws. Binance is also being scrutinised by the US Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service.

There are some questions about Finance as well. For example, It's not clear where the company is based. Its corporate structure is also surrounded by mystery, though it is led by a Canadian, Changpeng Zhao, known simply as ""CZ"". A Binance spokesperson has said the company is ""decentralised"" and it ""works with a number of regulated entities around the world"".","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/bfh7lu3g_binance_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none

It comes after the launch of the same service in the US which was then followed by a Checkout with Crypto feature, enabling PayPal users to actually spend their crypto when making purchases with online merchants.

The volatility and lack of regulation around cryptocurrencies, which are considered private money under English law, has often been seen as an impediment to their adoption by large payment companies such as PayPal.

Critics have often flagged how the potential anonymity offered by using crypto online has empowered cyber criminals and fraudsters operating on the internet.

It is not clear if and when the company will allow consumers in the UK to pay merchants using cryptocurrency.

PayPal hopes its service can address concerns about the volatility of the cryptocurrency by the settling the transaction in fiat cash, meaning merchants won't have to accept the risk themselves.

2021-08-23,Gadgets 360,"How Secure Is the Bitcoin Blockchain, and Is Your Cryptocurrency Safe?",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/how-secure-is-bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-technology-2516405,"People often ask if Bitcoin is a safe investment not because of the market's legendary volatility, but because they're worried about the security of the digital asset. Bitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world and has been around since 2009. Since then, in over a decade, the network has proven to be very resilient and powerful in protecting vital information. In recent years, the blockchain technology that Bitcoin runs on has become increasingly prevalent as cryptocurrency has begun to take center stage in many markets.

Blockchain technology that runs the virtual currency is known for its unparalleled security. It's one of the main reasons for its rapid adoption, with Bitcoin being one of the biggest success stories of the technology.

What is blockchain technology and how does it work?

Blockchain is associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, as a platform for digital money transactions. It's a database of all cryptocurrency transactions worldwide. However, this technology has also been used to store other types of data like medical records, data on humanitarian aid, and more.

Blockchain technology is like a ledger that is digital and open to the public. It provides a secure way of making and recording transactions. All transactions made using cryptocurrency are recorded and saved as data on blocks. All this information is time-stamped.

Is blockchain technology safe?

The easiest way to understand blockchain technology is to remember it as a series of blocks that store data. Each of the blocks holds a unique hash number and a link that connects it to the previous block. Every block is an important part of the sequence and it cannot be changed. If there is any change, the hash sum would alter and the block would longer be valid. This invariability is the foundation of blockchain' security along with three other aspects that we will look into below:

Cryptography

All blockchain transactions are secured by cryptography. Each block contains essentially a unique and private key that can be verified with a public key. If there is a change in transaction-related data, the block unique key becomes invalid. As a result, the block is discarded from the chain.

Decentralisation

Blockchain technology is secure as it is decentralised and distributed. There is no single point of failure, which makes it much harder to corrupt. Hacking into one part of the system cannot affect other parts. However, in the case of a private blockchain, this advantage is partially lost as they have a single point of control and a limited number of nodes. This restricts users from making changes to the ledger. Organisations operate these kinds of blockchains for their internal use, as it allows the company to control its own processes.

Consensus

All blockchain technology operates through a consensus model, which verifies that a transaction has taken place and legitimises it. Most consensus models run on protocols that include proof of work, proof of stake, proof of authority, etc.

What makes the Bitcoin blockchain safe?

The cryptographic system makes transactions irreversible — in other words, a block once created on the chain cannot be modified. However, you can add information to it. This restricts people from being able to reverse any transaction that has already taken place.

The Bitcoin blockchain is public. While the words transparency and public do not sound safe, in the case of Bitcoin it is. Despite the anonymity of the user, all transactions on the network are accessible to the public, making it difficult to hack or cheat the system.

It is decentralised. The Bitcoin network is distributed and has thousands of nodes all over the world that keep track of all transactions happening on the system. This ensures that in case something goes wrong on one server, there are others to pick up the slack. Hacking into any one server is pointless.

This is not to say that it is foolproof or impossible to hack — but it certainly isn't easy either. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, you're more likely to suffer losses from bad investing, or be tricked into giving up your coins, than to have them hacked away from you.","('https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-04/bitcoin-reuters_650x400_61524105890.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Analytics Insight,Best Cryptocurrency Mining Pools for Beginners in 2021,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/best-cryptocurrency-mining-pools-for-beginners-in-2021/,"Best Cryptocurrency Mining Pools for Beginners in 2021

Here’s an alternate way to invest in the cryptocurrency market.

Cryptocurrency has become a hot investment option and everyone is gearing up to bank on popular crypto coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, XRP, and Litecoin. While these digital tokens can be purchased from several trading platforms and exchanges, cryptocurrency mining pools are also an alternative to create cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency mining pools are groups that are operated by third parties to manage hash power from miners globally. These cryptocurrency dashboards have dashboards that can be understood by beginners and experienced miners.

How to Choose the Right Mining Pool?

Some basic criteria to look for are reputation, pool fee, uptime efficiency, location, support, and UI panel. A popular pool is often reliable and secure. Every cryptocurrency pool will require you to pay mining fees, hence it is best to opt for pools that have a high payout and low fees. Like cryptocurrencies, selecting the right mining pool also requires research. No matter where you are in the world, you should be able to operate the mining functions. Make sure to choose a pool that runs on a server that can be used globally as the response time of the device depends on it. As a beginner, facing issues with the network is common. If a pool has good support and feedback system, your queries will be solved quickly without losing precious time to mine cryptocurrencies.

Following these points, here are some of the most reliable cryptocurrency mining pools for beginners.

1. Slush Pool

Slush Pool is the oldest mining pool in existence, going a decade back to 2010. It’s a publicly available active mining pool and has a reputation for being stable and accurate. It has a smooth sign-up process and you can also create a demo miner to understand how the dashboard works. The website has two settings, one for beginners and one for experienced miners. Slush Pool also offers many features like preferences, device choice, and remote monitoring.

2. ViaBTC

ViaBTC supports many cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Dash. The services go beyond the mining pool as ViaBTC has related products like ViaWallet and cryptocurrency exchanges. With a global presence, ViaBTC offers stable payouts for miners and offers higher payouts.

3. AntPool

AntPool is the biggest mining pool in the world. It mines about 11% of all blocks and the servers work around the world. AntPool boasts an innovative peer-to-peer mining protocol that can link your device to the one that is the nearest during setup for a reliable connection.

4. BTC.com

If you are familiar with Bitcoin.com, BTC.com is owned by the same company. Before starting the mining section, BTC.com was known for its innovative Bitcoin wallet and its blockchain explorer. Mining in many geographies like Germany and the US, BTC.com has a medium-sized mining pool that supports many cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Ether, and more.

5. KanoPool

Functioning since 2014, KanoPool is a smaller pool comparatively but has low mining fees and an easy setup process. Registration is optional and the only requirement is a BTC wallet address and a username. The layout is simple, user-friendly, and has a detailed help page that has all the important FAQ answers.

6. Binance Pool

Binance Pool is powered by the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. After the success of its exchange platform and its native token Binance coin, Binance Pool is an upcoming popular platform that mines about 9% of all blocks, currently.

7. F2pool

The logic behind F2pool is that a user can contribute computing power to discover blocks. It is one of the best bitcoin mining pools and can be used for trading Bitcoins as well. F2pool supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and offers live chat support.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency-Mining-Pools.jpg',)",none

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reached as high as $50,152.24, the highest since mid-May, up 2.5%.

Bitcoin has recovered after trading in a range of about $30,000 to $40,000 for many weeks, after it plunged from a record near $65,000 in mid-April. Still, it’s up significantly in the past year.

As per CoinDesk, Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, surged to $3,321. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was trading at $0.32, up 1%. Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also were trading with gains over the last 24 hours.

The worldwide crypto adoption grew by 880% between June 2020 and July 2021, according to the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain data platform Chainalysis. India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption worldwide behind Vietnam, but ahead of countries such as the US, UK, and China, as per the report.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped Bitcoin rally.

In another news, PayPal Holdings Inc will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week. The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class, reported Reuters.

The total market value of cryptocurrencies was at $2.17 trillion on Sunday, according to data from CoinGecko.com, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The overall value has been helped in the past seven days by the 18% rally in Cardano and Binance Coin’s 11% gain, while Dogecoin is up about 9% over the period and Solana 73%, CoinGecko pricing showed.

Bitcoin's price hover around $50,000

Cryptocurrency prices continue to be in the red on August 23. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $2.13 trillion, a 1.37 percent increase over the last day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $93.71 billion, which makes a 13.09 percent decrease.

2021-08-23,NDTV Gadgets 360,"What Are Cryptocurrencies? Making Sense of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ether, and the Rest",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/opinion/what-are-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-dogecoin-ether-2514871,"To understand cryptocurrency, you need to understand how money works, and what makes these new assets useful, and potentially also usable as currency in the future. First, there was ""physical"" money - notes and coins. Then came e-Money - the numbers that show in your e-banking apps. Both these are issued by the Government.

And then came cryptocurrency, a type of electronic money that is not issued by any Government. It is also called Math Money because it is created and managed using blockchains which are computer networks powered by advanced mathematics. Today, the use case for cryptocurrency is mostly its value as an asset, while the underlying blockchain technology is already powering a number of applications. But the future of money could look very different.

1. What is blockchain?

Let's say Svetlana borrows 10,000 Rupees from me. She is supposed to return it in a week but doesn't. I remind her but she has conveniently ""forgotten"" about it. What can I do? Nothing, except never lending her anything ever again! True story.

Now suppose, at the time of lending the money, a few friends are present. They all clicked a pic or shot a video of me lending Svetlana the money and her promising to return it in a week. And each of these friends posts the pic/ video on Instagram, Facebook, etc. Now that is solid evidence. And Svetlana can't really delete all these videos/ pics from the Internet.

Now that's something like a blockchain.

A blockchain is typically a bunch of computers (nodes) connected to each other. All of these computers contain the same information (e.g. a ledger of transactions). To ""hack"" this information, you will need to ""hack"" most of these computers at the same time. And that's a pretty tough thing to do!

There are many blockchains in the world. The Bitcoin Blockchain is the first and oldest one. It records all transactions of the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Anyone can run a node of this blockchain. All you need is a computer with enough storage space and a strong Internet connection.

2. How are cryptocurrencies created?

There are 2 common ways of creating crypto-currencies. One is the style used by Bitcoin and the other is the style used by Ethereum.

In the Bitcoin-style, there are a bunch of computers called miners who are constantly trying to solve mathematical puzzles. Roughly every 10 minutes, one of these miners wins this race to solve the puzzle. This miner wins a reward which is currently 6.25 bitcoins. That's about Rs. 2 crores. Yes, you read that right. Every 10 minutes there is someone getting 2 Crores worth of bitcoin.

But don't get too jealous of these miners. They have to spend tons of money on computers and electricity. And they can never be sure how much they will actually end up earning.

Many years ago anyone could mine or create bitcoins using a laptop! Well, not anymore. Today you need a ton of computing power for this. In case you want to understand this concept of mining in all its complicated tech glory, you can download the free Future Money Playbook that I have written.

In the Ethereum-style, you can create your own crypto in minutes. My daughters were quite fed up hearing about Dogecoin. So they decided to create their own cat-based cryptocurrency. All they needed to do was customize a ""smart contract"" and publish it to the Ethereum blockchain. That's it! In a few minutes, they had created a new cryptocurrency with a supply of 7 billion tokens - one for each human on Earth. True story.

3. What are the types of cryptocurrencies?

There are 3 common types of cryptos - medium of exchange, utility coin, and stablecoins.

A medium of exchange crypto can be used to buy and sell stuff. Examples are Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Monero. These are the types that Governments hate. That's because they can be used by criminals. But hey, criminals can also use cash! So it's a little unfair to blame these poor little cryptos.

Then there are utility coins. Just like oil ""fuels"" the global economy, utility coins, like Ether, ""fuel"" blockchain-based businesses.

And finally, there are stablecoins. These are backed by normal fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Japanese Yen.

4. Numbers don't lie

The world's first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin (BTC). It is a medium of exchange crypto with a total worth of more than $880 billion. And the world's largest bank, JP Morgan Chase is worth $470 billion.

The world's most popular utility coin is Ether (ETH) with a total worth of $377 billion. India's largest bank, HDFC Bank, pales in comparison with a total worth of $140.37 billion.

Tether (USDT) is the most popular stablecoin with a total worth of $64 billion. Doesn't seem much? Well, that's also the size of ICICI Bank!

That does not mean a user or investor gets an automatic update about each successful transaction. It's more like the data is stored and updated on the digital ledger but anyone who wants to check details has to look for it. But how do you do that? That is done with the help of tools that work as a sort of “Google” for cryptocurrency.

What about cross-platform data? Meaning if a Bitcoin blockchain user wants to check the details of a transaction related to, say, the Ethereum blockchain, how to do it? That can also be done by the same process. These tools are called blockchain explorers. Most of them provide services for more than one blockchain.

What are blockchain explorers?

Simply put, a blockchain explorer is a type of software that pulls data from a blockchain and creates a database for users to search for particular information from the available resource. They allow users to see details related to various cryptocurrency transactions, including the amount transacted, the source and the destination of the transfers, and the status of transactions.

A user can provide searchable terms and the explorer will throw up the results in a table form of all matching transactions.

A blockchain explorer allows for the exploration of data of recently mined blocks or transactions. They also allow a user to do the following:

Explore the transaction history of any wallet address, improving transparency on a blockchain.

The latest transactions in a blockchain and the amounts transacted.

Explore receiving addresses and change addresses. During a transaction, a specified amount is sent to the intended address and the remainder of the fund in the sending address is sent to a “change” address. The change is not available to spend until the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain network.

Explore the largest transaction of the day. The Whale Alert [https://whale-alert.io/] website is an example of this.

Explore mempool status. The mempool is where all the valid transactions wait to be confirmed by the network. This gives the details of unconfirmed transactions.

Helps users see fees paid for transactions, blockchain difficulty, hash rate, and other data.

Why use a blockchain explorer?

A blockchain wallet provides some data but it is limited in details and reach. An explorer, on the other hand, can provide data related to transactions carried out on all wallets on a blockchain. A major benefit of using explorers is they help maintain transparency.

Explorers allow users to check balance and expenditure on smart contract addresses, for checking if a wallet address is valid to a blockchain before sending crypto coins to it. They also help in checking whether the transaction has reached the intended recipient and see what went wrong if the transaction has not gone through. Explorers also give information about the cost of a transaction. As research tools, explorers help users in making important decisions on transactions and investments.

Blockchain explorer examples

One of the earliest blockchain explorers are blockexplorer.com. Since then, several such tools have been developed. Some of them are blockchain.com — now blockchain.org — along with blockchair, tokenview, and etherscan. Most of the available blockchain explorers cover a majority of blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Cryptocurrency_coins_Reuters_main_1629671903930.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,NDTV Gadgets 360,Cryptocurrency Predictions: What Is Pivot Point and How Is It Calculated,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/pivot-point-calculator-cryptocurrency-predictions-market-trends-trading-bull-bear-2516330,"There is no dearth of technical terms in cryptocurrency trading. One of the reasons for this is the relatively new nature of the market. However, in many ways, trading in cryptocurrency is similar to trading in equities or stocks. Both are speculative with a varying degree of risks and investors in both markets often depend on their reading of a few parameters to gauge the overall trend. One of these parameters is pivot points. Investors calculate these points based on the high, low, and closing prices of previous trading sessions to see whether they should stop or double down on their investments.

What are pivot points?

A pivot point is found through technical analysis and is an indicator of the overall trend of the market. It is simply the average of the high, low, and closing prices from the previous trading day or session. If the market the next day runs above the pivot point, it is considered that the market is showing bullish sentiment. If not, it could be time to stop and rethink your investment strategy.

When pivot points are combined with other technical tools, they throw up a broad picture about an asset, as well as the support and resistance levels during a short-term trading session.

How are pivot points calculated?

Pivot points can be calculated in several ways. But the most common of them is a five-point system. This method uses the previous session's high, low, and close data — along with two support levels and two resistance levels. Using these price points, a pivot point is calculated. The equation for calculating a pivot point is given below.

Pivot Point = (Previous High + Previous Low + Previous Close) divided by 3

The equation to calculate support levels is:

Support 1 = (Pivot Point x 2) − Previous High

Support 2 = Pivot Point − (Previous High − Previous Low)

To find the resistance levels, use this equation:

Resistance 1 = (Pivot Point x 2) − Previous Low

Resistance 2 = Pivot Point + (Previous High − Previous Low)

These results are used to plot a course for five levels: two resistance levels, two support levels, and a pivot point. Collectively, the method is known as the five-point system. This system allows traders to define an area where the price seems most sensitive and is likely to cause a shift in the market sentiment.

Time frames

The common practice is to use pivot points for smaller time frames — at most for 4-hour charts and for as small as 15-minute charts.

Types of pivot points

There are five types of pivot points. Apart from the pivot point finding method discussed above (Standard Pivot Point), there are Camarilla Pivot Point, Denmark Pivot Point, Fibonacci Pivot Point, and Woodies Pivot Point.

How are pivot points different from other indicators?

Instead of relying on the current price movement, the pivot point system makes use of the previous day/ session's price data. This approach provides traders with an early signal of the things to come so they can plan accordingly. The pivot points remain static until the start of the next trading session.

Limitations of pivot points

Experts say pivot points are suited only for intra-day trading as they are based on simple calculations and may not hold true during swing trading. Also at times, volatile price movements can completely disregard pivot point predictions. When volatility is high, experts say it's best not to depend on pivot points as price fluctuations are rapid and wide for any predetermined calculation strategy.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Market_crash_Reuters_1621501462274.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Reuters,PayPal launches crypto buying and selling in the UK,https://www.reuters.com/technology/paypal-launches-crypto-buying-selling-uk-2021-08-22/,"LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week, the company said on Monday.

The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class.

With over 403 million active accounts globally, the San Jose, California-based company is one of the largest mainstream financial companies to offer consumers access to cryptocurrencies.

PayPal launched cryptocurrency buying and selling in the United States early this year, later enabling customers to use their digital coin holdings to shop at the millions of merchants on its network.

The company hoped its foray into the new asset class would encourage global use of virtual coins and prepare its network for new digital currencies that may be developed by corporations and central banks.

""We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support— and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role

digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce,"" Jose Fernandez da Ponte, vice president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said in a statement.

In the UK, PayPal's service will rival that of established cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O), as well as well fintech startups such as Revolut.

Customers will be able to buy bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash through their PayPal wallets online or on the mobile app.

The move comes as more established financial companies have started offering their clients, both consumers and institutions, access to digital assets, amid rising cryptocurrency prices.

Nikita Ovchinnik, chief business development officer of 1inch Network, said that several new institutional investors began adding exposure to crypto in the past year, and that “They didn't come for short-term gains.”

Another positive sign for the crypto sector is the ever-growing list of unicorns. Analysts expect more companies to join the list as the adoption of crypto and blockchain increases.

Will Bitcoin’s hesitation near the $50,000 mark shift the focus to altcoins? Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that are likely to attract traders' attention in the short term.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded off the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($45,049) on Aug. 19, and the bulls pushed the price above the stiff overhead resistance at $48,144 on Aug. 20. The bears are currently attempting to stall the up-move at the psychological resistance at $50,000.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bulls do not give up much ground and flip the $48,144 level to support, it will indicate strength. The BTC/USDT pair could then pick up momentum and start its northward march toward $58,000.

The rising 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

Alternatively, if bears pull the price below $48,144, the pair could drop to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) ($45,816). This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could embolden the bears.

The sellers will then try to sink the price below the breakout level at $42,451.67. If they succeed, it will suggest the start of a deeper correction.

The four-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the zone between $49,500 and $50,000. If they can sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $46,600 and then to $44,000.

If that happens, it will suggest that the bulls are losing their grip and the pair could then remain range-bound between $44,000 and $50,000 for a few days. The bears will have to pull the price below $42,451.67 to gain the upper hand.

ADA/USDT

Cardano (ADA) is in a strong uptrend. The bulls pushed the price above the all-time high at $2.47 on Aug. 20, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick showed selling at higher levels. The altcoin formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on Aug. 21, indicating indecision among bulls and bears.

The uncertainty resolved to the upside on Aug. 23 as the bulls have again pushed the price to a new all-time high. If buyers sustain the price above the breakout level at $2.47, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $3.

However, the long wick on the Aug. 23 candlestick suggests that bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They will try to pull the price back below $2.36 and trap the aggressive bulls. If that happens, the pair may correct to $2.20.

If the price rebounds off $2.20, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. A breakout and close above $2.47 to $2.65 will enhance the prospects of the continuation of the uptrend. Alternatively, a break below $2.20 could pull the price down to $1.94.

The four-hour chart shows that the 20-day EMA is sloping up but the RSI is forming a negative divergence. This suggests that the bullish momentum may be slowing down. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA.

Contrary to this assumption, if bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest strength. That could attract further buying, and the pair may then rally to the psychological resistance at $3.

AVAX/USDT

Avalanche (AVAX) rallied from $18.41 on Aug. 17 to $50.27 on Aug. 21, a 173% rally within a short time. This sharp up-move has pushed the RSI above 92, indicating the rally is over-extended in the short term.

AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The long wick on the Aug. 21 candlestick shows that bears are attempting to defend the psychological resistance at $50. On the downside, the first support is at $40. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that bulls are not booking profits aggressively, as they anticipate the rally to continue further.

A breakout and close above $44 could improve the prospects of a retest of the all-time high at $60.30.

On the contrary, if bears pull the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $38.09, the AVAX/USDT pair could correct to the 50% retracement level at $34.34. A break below this support will indicate that the bullish momentum may have weakened.

The four-hour chart shows that bears are attempting to stall the relief rally at the overhead resistance at $44.60 and the bulls are buying on dips to $40. This suggests that the pair could remain range-bound between these two levels in the short term.

If the bulls drive the price above $44.60, the pair could rally to $50.27. A breakout and close above this level will signal the resumption of the uptrend. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate that traders are booking profits and not buying the dips. That could signal the start of a deeper correction.

CAKE/USDT

PancakeSwap (CAKE) is currently in a strong recovery. Sustained buying by the bulls pushed the price above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $22.74 on Aug. 20.

CAKE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bulls sustain the price above $22.74, the relief rally could reach the 50% retracement level at $26.85 and then the 61.8% retracement level at $30.96. The bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance in this zone.

On the way down, the critical support to watch out for is the 20-day EMA ($20.37). If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest that sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA could open the doors for a further decline to $16.

The four-hour chart shows the price is trading inside a rising wedge pattern. If bears sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to the support line of the wedge. This level is likely to act as strong support, and a sharp rebound off it will indicate that traders are buying on dips.

A breakout and close above $24.65 will suggest the resumption of the up-move. The next target objective on the upside is the resistance line of the wedge. The bullish momentum could pick up if bulls thrust the price above the wedge.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) had been trading in a large range between $8.51 and $17.56 since late May. The bulls pushed the price above the resistance of the range on Aug. 18, clearing the path for a possible move to the pattern target at $26.61.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the long wick on the Aug. 23 candlestick and the RSI above 83 suggest the rally is overextended in the short term. This could attract profit-booking by the bulls, resulting in a minor correction or consolidation in the next few days.

If bulls do not give up much ground and flip the $17.56 level into support, the ATOM/USDT pair will again try to resume the uptrend. A break above $26.61 could open the doors for a rally to $28 and then to $30.

The bears will have to pull and sustain the price below $17 to invalidate the bullish sentiment.

The four-hour chart shows that bears are mounting a stiff resistance near $24. Although bulls had pushed the price above this resistance, they could not sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.

A positive sign is that buyers are not dumping their positions in a hurry. The pair could consolidate between $21 and $24 for some time. A breakout and close above $24 will indicate strength and signal the resumption of the up-move.

Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate the start of a deeper correction to $17.56.

2021-08-23,CNN,"For the crypto world, bipartisan infrastructure package brings a 'political awakening'",https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/22/politics/crypto-political-awakening-infrastructure-package/index.html,"Washington, DC (CNN) Members of the cryptocurrency world are donating to crypto-focused organizations, hiring lobbyists and ramping up advocacy efforts in a push to get lawmakers on board with the industry, as pressure builds on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to address a cryptocurrency provision of the bipartisan infrastructure bill before a vote in the House.

""The crypto world has been made politically aware,"" said Anne Fauvre-Willis, chief operating officer at Oasis Labs, a blockchain privacy company. ""For many there has been a personal political awakening.""

The push follows a back-and-forth debate between Senators and dueling amendment proposals earlier this month that would have modified language included in the bipartisan infrastructure package meant to regulate cryptocurrency -- which uses blockchain technology for online transactions.

Despite the debate, a cryptocurrency language compromise amendment failed before final passage of the legislation in the chamber Tuesday, leaving crypto advocates concerned for the fate of an industry they are personally invested in and care deeply about.

As it stands, the provision would impose more federal regulation on cryptocurrencies and could dramatically expand the number of cryptocurrency users who would have to report filings to the Internal Revenue Service -- something that has struck a nerve with supporters of an industry designed to take out intermediaries and grant autonomy to its users via a decentralized system.

While a small number of advocates with cryptocurrency think tanks and associations have been making noise in DC for years, leaders in the crypto space told CNN that the recent debate over cryptocurrency regulations on Capitol Hill caught the attention of thousands of people who were previously disengaged from politics.

""There is a whole new swath of people paying attention to what's happening in Washington,"" said Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, a cryptocurrency research and analysis firm.

Like Fauvre-Willis, Selkis told CNN the conversation around cryptocurrency in DC prompted an ""awakening for many people.""

The birth of the 'crypto voter'

Since early August, the phrase ""I am now a single issue voter,"" has gone viral among crypto circles on Twitter, flooding the feeds of both high profile crypto leaders and ordinary traders who have racked up thousands of likes and hundreds of retweets for sharing that they will only vote for candidates supportive of the booming industry.

Selkis' own Twitter bio reads, ""single issue voter: anti-crypto politicians should be afraid.""

But according to members of the crypto community, while ""crypto voters"" may prioritize protecting the booming industry, they don't yet belong to one party or the other.

For her part, Evan Greer, who for the past decade has organized large-scale online protests in support of net neutrality and in opposition of internet censorship and government surveillance, said that in her experience, ""Tech issues often fall outside of the historical Democrat vs. Republican partisan divide.""

""These are fundamental issues, about how people orient toward institutions of power whether that's corporate power or government power,"" Greer -- director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights nonprofit -- told CNN.

""Among young folks especially, there is skyrocketing skepticism about arbitrary forms of power, either from the government or corporations, and we see that play out in the crypto community,"" Greer said. ""The traditional left-right party politics that have dominated US politics for young people are really starting to erode.""

Push to protect crypto industry goes beyond social media

Earlier this month, 25 new companies have expressed interest in joining the Blockchain Association -- a trade association with 46 existing member companies that works to educate lawmakers on and improve public policy around cryptocurrency.

""This is a pivotal moment for the crypto ecosystem because it was the first time that so many people have in a unified way reached out to the Senate [and lawmakers] and let them know this is a super vibrant, super creative group,"" said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.

In recent months, the Blockchain Association beefed up its lobbying operation, Smith, who has been with the association for three years, told CNN. The group has an internal Republican lobbyist, internal Democratic lobbyist and three lobbying firms on retainer.

Smith, who is also registered to lobby, told CNN that member companies are now hiring lobbyists or lobbying firms too.

Asked why those unfamiliar with the crypto space may care about the recent cryptocurrency advocacy push, Smith said it comes down to a belief in the benefit of having autonomy over one's financial transactions.

""Even if you don't understand the tech [behind crypto], the ability to use your money and data in the way that you want to use it and to have a digital life where you're not at the mercy of intermediaries is something that should be attractive to a lot of people,"" she said.

Coin Center, a think tank started in 2014 that focuses on cryptocurrency policy, has seen ""a surge"" in donations both from individuals and corporations, Neeraj Agrawal, the organization's director of communications, told CNN.

Since August 1, the organization has received gifts from more than 350 individual donors, he said.

And Fight for the Future -- which directed more than 40,000 people to their online portal to call to Senators earlier this month, urging the lawmakers to scale back the proposed cryptocurrency regulations -- has since received more than $20,000 in donations to their organization, mostly given in cryptocurrency.

Creators and users of cryptocurrency, ""have now woken up to the fact that government can kick down your door and shut down your cool project,"" Greer said.

""Any lawmaker that wants to get support from young voters needs to show they aren't utterly ignorant about these issues,"" Greer said.

Fight for the Future will use the donations to support the push to protect crypto in the infrastructure bill, which is moving toward the House of Representatives, Greer said.

The organization will launch a ""full court press"" operation, Greer said, requesting meetings with lawmakers, driving more phone calls and emails to legislators and creating educational videos and explainers.

""All of that costs money,"" she said.","('https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210809123837-crypto-phone-super-tease.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,ABC News,"What to know about 'stablecoins,' the 'bridge' between cryptocurrencies and traditional money",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/stablecoins-bridge-cryptocurrencies-traditional-money/story?id=79500575,"In the exploding realm of cryptocurrencies, a new line of financial products has emerged that has caught the attention of both investors and regulators -- so-called ""stablecoins,"" which are backed by cash or another reserve asset.

Stablecoins seek to provide the best of both worlds: the stability of a traditional government-backed currency as well as the privacy and convenience offered by crypto transactions. They are often marketed towards investors who may not have the stomach for the volatility associated with Bitcoin, Ethereum and other popular cryptos -- which have been known to see-saw widely in value on a day-to-day basis.

The existing stablecoins market is worth some $113 billion, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said earlier this month during a speech at the Aspen Security Forum. He added that in July, nearly three-quarters of trading on all crypto trading platforms occurred between a stablecoin and some other token.

Even social media behemoth Facebook is trying to get in on the action, seeking to launch a stablecoin-like project of its own of its own after its initial Libra cryptocurrency efforts fizzled.

As their popularity rises, stablecoins have also recently drawn new scrutiny from authorities and regulators. Federal Reserve officials mulled over the threats posed by ""new financial arrangements such as stablecoins"" in a recent meeting, according to a readout released earlier this week, raising concerns over the lack of transparency and regulations.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last month also called on regulators to ""act quickly"" in forming new regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, raising alarms over their ""potential risks to end-users, the financial system, and national security.""

Here is what experts say investors should know about the novel class of cryptos dominating headlines in recent weeks.

What are stablecoins?

Stablecoins are essentially cryptocurrencies that are backed by a reserve asset -- usually a traditional currency such as the U.S. dollar. The valuations of stablecoins are therefore supposed to be less volatile than other digital currencies, because they are pegged directly to a fixed, non-virtual currency.

""Think of stablecoin as a cryptocurrency without, or with limited, volatility. That is the best way to think about it,"" Haran Segram, a professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business, told ABC News, adding they are sometimes looked at as ""the bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies."" Fiat currencies are traditional currencies like the dollar, backed by the government.

""Stablecoins are backed by other central bank currencies,"" Segram explained.

Bryan Routledge, an associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, added that this makes stablecoins more useful as an everyday currency.

""For example, the price of Bitcoin is just stunningly volatile,"" he told ABC News. ""That makes it harder to use as a currency."" In 2021 alone, Bitcoin's value has seen swings of 100% -- starting the year at a price of less than $30,000, reaching a peak of over $63,000 in April, before receding back to the $30,000 mark in July. As of Friday, Bitcoin was trading at a little over $46,000.

""When I tell you a latte cost $2.50, you know what that means -- but if I quote a price of a latte in Bitcoin, it's just really hard to keep track of because one day it's the equivalent of $2.50, the next day it's equivalent to $25,"" he added.

Pegging cryptocurrencies to a fixed exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar, as stablecoins attempt to do, makes them ""more useful as a currency,"" according to Routledge.

'It's a stablecoin because they call it a stablecoin'

While this may sound like an overall positive development for everyday investors interested in crypto, experts and authorities have warned of lurking risks associated with the largely unchecked stablecoin market.

Segram noted that one of the most popular stablecoins out there is Tether, which claims to be backed one-to-one to the U.S. dollar.

""The issue with that is some research was done into that, and then actually they found that one unit of that stablecoin is backed by .74 of the U.S. dollar,"" Segram said. ""So things like that, what people put out saying it's a stablecoin, it might not be truly a stablecoin.""

""That's something that investors and your audience should be aware of,"" he told ABC News. ""Because people don't know exactly what's happening in the background, and I would really encourage your readers to be aware of that.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office led an investigation into Tether that said there were periods of time when Tether did not have access to banking and ""held no reserves to back tethers in circulation at the rate of one dollar for every tether, contrary to its representations."" As part of a settlement reached with James’ office, Tether is barred from doing business with New Yorkers but admitted no wrongdoing and pledged increased transparency. The Hong Kong-based entity still maintains on its website, however, that Tether tokens are ""100% backed by Tether’s reserves"" at a conversion rate of one Tether token equaling one U.S. dollar.

""Under the terms of the settlement, we admit no wrongdoing,"" Tether said in a statement on its website in response to the investigation. ""The settlement amount we have agreed to pay to the Attorney General’s Office should be viewed as a measure of our desire to put this matter behind us and focus on our business."" The company added that it is pleased by the ""loyalty"" customers have shown, saying that the market capitalization of tethers grew from $2 billion to an excess of $34 billion during the past two years, while the investigation was ongoing.

""Tether is complicated because it's an international business,"" Routledge added in regards to who regulates it. ""Cryptocurrencies, one of their either charms or weak points, is they don't sort of fall under anybody's direct jurisdiction.""

For most stablecoins, ""it's a stablecoin because they call it a stablecoin,"" Routledge added.

Despite assurances of cash reserves, there is a risk that some stablecoins might operate under the assumption that the likelihood of having to liquidate all at once is slim if confidence remains high.

""If everybody thinks Tether is going to be a stablecoin, it will work as a stablecoin and the few people that need to exchange it at the 'Tether store,' to be colloquial, would do that,"" he said. ""The trouble with that policy is that you can get what the foreign exchange economists would call like a speculative attack, which is that we don't think Tether has enough money, and I think everybody thinks that, they're all going to show up and demand those currencies -- It's a bit like a run on the bank.""

""That's what makes it really hard to stabilize, because your credibility as a stablecoin is the thing that makes it stable, and that's inherently flighty,"" he said.

Why the Fed and Yellen are so concerned about stablecoins

Yellen's calls for quick action on creating regulatory frameworks for stablecoins have been echoed by other lawmakers.

Stablecoins were also recently debated by Fed officials, who ""highlighted the fragility and the general lack of transparency associated with stablecoins,"" at their most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. ""The importance of monitoring them closely, and the need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework to address any risks to financial stability associated with such products.""

Segram said that while stablecoins can ""regulate themselves to some extent by being transparent with the public, I think Yellen is calling for more top-down regulations rather than let it be voluntary.""

This could mean having the reserve currency kept somewhere independent, or having claims be regularly audited, he added.

Segram added that the Fed, meanwhile, might have other concerns around stablecoins' growth.

""If stablecoins become popular, the central bank loses its control,"" Segram said, noting that there have been discussions of stablecoin-like ""Central Bank Digital Currency"" to be issued by the Federal Reserve.

A Central Bank Digital Currency would give the Fed more control ""over how we manage demand, supply and all other means,"" Segram said.

Routledge added that the Fed may also have worries about a ""banking panic"" situation if a lot of assets are flowing through a specific stablecoin.

""If for whatever reason that stablecoin has a shock to it -- that can be a systemic event to the financial system,"" he added. ""That is what's on the Fed's radar.""

SEC Chair Gensler, meanwhile, signaled a regulation crackdown could be looming during his remarks earlier this month in Aspen.

Gensler said the use of stablecoins on crypto trading platforms ""may facilitate those seeking to sidestep a host of public policy goals connected to our traditional banking and financial system: anti-money laundering, tax compliance, sanctions, and the like.""

""This affects our national security, too,"" he added. Gensler said he looks forward to working with regulators and lawmakers on these matters.

Despite the risks, Segram sees cryptocurrencies as the future, which may be in part why regulators are raising alarm bells and why there is so much discussion over a potential central bank digital currency. Major U.S. companies including Amazon and Walmart have recently announced they are hiring cryptocurrency experts, and a growing number of firms have started accepting cryptos as a form of payment.

China's central bank has already launched its digital Yuan, he added, saying that the U.S. most likely will at some point in if it does not want to lose its status as the ""reserve currency of the world.""

""If a stablecoin is issued by a private authority, it is not 100% fail-proof,"" he said. ""In a democracy like ours, or other democracies where there's some political stability and currency stability, a central bank digital currency might be the way to go.""

""I think of stablecoin sort of as a link between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, this takes that to another level,"" he said.","('https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/money-illustration-rf-gty-jc-210820_1629489806353_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg',)",none

NEW DELHI: Cardano, a relatively lesser-known cryptocurrency, has raced to the top three. In its dash to the top, Cardano (ADA) has made a stunning recovery from a $1 trillion crash and occupies the third place after Bitcoin and Ethereum.Cardano’s rise to the top has happened at a time predicted to be a ‘quiet one’ by market analysts. By Friday morning, Cardano (ADA) completed the week-long run registering 10 percent growth. This in terms of crypto gains is a formidable and matchless run.Its volumes swelled on the back of a software upgrade that could help the currency to stand next to Ethereum which is only second to Bitcoin.According to Coindesk, the digital coin hit an all-time high Friday of $2.58, an increase of more than 18 percent. Year to date, it has seen returns of 1,294 per cent recording a recovery of $82 billion, in the process surpassing Binance coin and securing the third position.This unprecedented rally may again continue following the update that is expected sometime on September 12. This phase will allow smart contract functionality and for a range of decentralized finance applications to be used on the Cardano network.Smart contract functions have been the strong points of any cryptocurrency and will continue to be so, for a longer period until an alternative is found to better the trading experience and exchange.Smart contracts are a way to ensure agreements can be validated securely. Ethereum has already arrived at that point and that is said to be its biggest strength.Another upgrade is on the cards when Cardano moves into the third phase known as Goguen . Enough space has been created in this phase to include Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens.It must be recalled that Cardano was founded by the co-founder of Ethereum, Hoskinson four years ago, and if there is anybody in the world of cryptocurrency who knows the major takeaways of Ethereum vis-à-vis Cardano, it is Hoskinson.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85533972,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-301800,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

It was clearly the week of altcoins surging way past the cryptocurrency market formen Bitcoin and Ethereum to make a substantial mark. While Bitcoin ($49,235) saw a 7-day rise of 5.67 percent and Ethereum ($3,236) rose just 0.03 percent in the same time, altcoins like Cardano ($2.53) recorded a weekly jump of 17.47 percent, along with Cardano ($2.53) which spiked 17.47 percent, Polkadot ($27.72) which peaked 23.02 percent, Solana ($74.52), which rose almost 64.85 percent and Terra ($27.94), which hiked 63.44 percent.

Winds of Change

In fact, Cardano, with a current market cap of 80,559,983,767 dollars overtook Binance Coin’s market capitalization ($75,750,693,612) as the third biggest cryptocurrency after Ethereum and Bitcoin. This is mostly thanks to its upcoming Alonzo upgrade, which will incorporate smart contracts, opening a range of applications like DeFi, NFTs, automated lending, and more and giving stiff competition to peers like Ethereum.

Closer home, crypto adoption in India is exponentially growing, with the country ranking second, succeeded by Vietnam amidst the countries that make a lion’s share of cryptocurrency usage, with 9 percent of the respondents claiming to utilize cryptocurrency, per market research firm Finder.

In fact, all five leading nations in terms of bitcoin ownership are located in Asia. Bitcoin (16 percent) is the most popular coin, followed by Ethereum and Bitcoin cash (6 percent) and Ripple (8 percent). While men (32 percent) take precedence over women (23 percent) in terms of possession, young adults (32 percent) aged between 18-24 when it comes to cryptocurrency ownership. Young adults lead the way with 32% of those aged 18-24 have invested in cryptocurrency.

Regulatory woes to end?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clarified the government’s stand on cryptocurrency, stating that the area has a lot of potential in terms of fuelling the country’s fintech sector. Notably, the work on the pending cryptocurrency regulation bill is nearly complete and the cabinet will decide further, with chances of it being presented in the winter parliament session

""We cannot be moving ahead as if this doesn't exist. We are not saying no to cryptocurrency. We are saying we will have to see how this technology can help fintech to maximize the potential it has. But how sophisticated regulation can be is something which I want to work with the RBI,"" she elaborated.

The necessity of regulations in this field, however, was highlighted in the recent case of cryptocurrencies worth 97 million dollars being stolen from the digital currency wallets of Liquid, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange. In the meantime, all deposits and withdrawals on the platform have been suspended.

Furthermore, terrorist groups like ISIS have begun receiving funds in bitcoins as well, External Minister S Jaishankar said. The money flow, resource mobilization, and killing rewards to ISIL (Daesh) in Syria, Iraq, and its affiliates in Africa have increased in recent times, he explained.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/08/cryptocurrency-770x433.jpg',)",none

2021-08-23,Yahoo Finance,"Ethereum Classic Stops For Gas, Along With Bitcoin And Doge, On Bullish Moon Trip",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-classic-stops-gas-along-145939300.html,"On Saturday morning Ethereum Classic (CRYPTO: ETC), along with apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and the ever-popular Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), was consolidating Friday’s bullish trek north. All three cryptos have recently had a relative strength index (RSI) of over 70% which puts them into overbought conditions for technical traders.

A cryptocurrency, like a stock, always enters into a period of consolidation after either a large incline or decline. Ethereum Classic rose 137% between its June 22 low of $32.17 and its Aug. 15 high of $77.37. Although bulls would love to see the original Ethereum version ‘moon’ it will need to stop for gas along the way.

The Ethereum Classic Chart: On Aug. 7 Ethereum Classic broke up from a descending trendline that had been holding the crypto down since June 3. After busting up through the trendline Ethereum Classic soared about 46% over the course of nine days.

When the crypto reached its $77 high its relative strength index measured in at 79% which was a sell signal. The crypto then retraced about 22%, which cooled its RSI down to a much more comfortable 57%, before making another bullish move up.

In its consolidation Ethereum Classic has created another descending trendline which it has now rejected on four separate trading days. For technical traders a trendline must demonstrate support or rejection at least three times to be valid. Ethereum Classic rejected from its new trendline on Aug. 15, 16 and 20 and on Saturday morning the crypto tried to jump over it but failed.

As of 10:00 a.m. ET Ethereum Classic’s trading volume was about 143 million compared to its average 10-day volume of 547 million. When a crypto or stock trades down on low volume it is usually a bullish consolidation as opposed to a bear break.

Ethereum Classic is trading over the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending above the 21-day, both of which are bullish indicators. On Saturday morning the crypto tested the eight-day as support and held above it. Ethereum Classic is also trading above the 200-day simple moving average indicating overall sentiment is bullish.

Story continues

Bulls want to see big bullish volume come in and drive Ethereum Classic up over the descending trendline. If the crypto can clear the level it has resistance above at about $72 and $79.

Bears want to see big bearish volume come in and drop the crypto down below support at the eight-day EMA. If Ethereum Classic loses the support level it could fall toward $65. Below that there is support near the $57 mark. etc_aug._21.png

2021-08-23,NDTV.com,"Here's How You Can Invest In Bitcoin, Ethereum, Other Crypto Coins In India",https://www.ndtv.com/business/crytocurrency-in-india-heres-how-you-can-invest-in-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-other-coins-in-india-2515676,"In India, some popular exchanges are WazirX, CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Cryptocurrency has become a lucrative financial asset for investors these days with its scope to provide steady returns, despite its volatile nature. Being a form of a digital asset, cryptocurrency is primarily based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. The decentralized structure of the virtual currency allows it to exist without the control of governments or regulation of any central authority.

Ever since billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla Inc invested in the world's largest cryptocurrency- bitcoin, leading crypto coins such as ethereum, dogecoin, and bitcoin have caught the attention of the bigger investors as well as the common man.

In India, many are still advocating the classification of cryptocurrency as an asset. Recently, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the cabinet note on the cryptocurrency bill is ready and the Cabinet is yet to clear the same. Presently, cryptocurrencies are under no regulation in the country, which often makes it risky for investors.

However, one must know the basic steps of investing in cryptocurrency. Here is how you can invest in crypto coins such as bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin in India:

Step 1: Find the right crypto exchange

Since there is no established structure for trading in cryptocurrency yet, crypto exchanges are the platforms where people can buy and sell their digital assets. In India, some of the more popular exchanges are WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Step 2: Create an account

After selecting the crypto exchange for trading, create your account on the platform. After creating an account, select the amount you plan to invest, what you seek to invest. Read all policies of the platform carefully. The platform will ask for the submission of documents as proof in order to prevent any fraudulent activities.



Step 3: Set up the account for trading

One needs to have money in the account before buying cryptocurrencies. The money can be transferred from one's bank account to a particular exchange account. Upon transferring funds, make sure that both accounts are linked.

Step 4: Making the investment

After the accounts are linked and the crypto exchange account has money, one needs to select which coin they want to invest in. The world's biggest and most popular cryptocurrency is bitcoin, followed by ethereum by market cap. Other leading coins include tether, dogecoin, XRP, cardano, binance coin. After purchasing, make sure you store codes to the account, to protect it from risks such as hacking. Experts advise storing the coins purchased in a crypto wallet.



Latest prices:



On Saturday, August 21, bitcoin was last trading 3.26 per cent higher at $48,707.8 against the US dollar. Ethereum - the world's second-largest cryptocurrency was last up 1.15 per cent higher at $3,273.60 against the American currency.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/ogfsfjs8_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,Inside Afghanistan's cryptocurrency underground as the country plunges into turmoil,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/21/bitcoin-afghanistan-cryptocurrency-taliban-capital-flight.html,"Crypto trader and vlogger Farhan Hotak traveling to the Shah Wali Kot District in Afghanistan.

Farhan Hotak isn't your typical 22 year-old Afghan. In the last week, he helped his family of ten flee the province of Zabul in southern Afghanistan and travel 97 miles to a city on the Pakistani border. But unlike others choosing to leave the country, once his relatives were in safe hands, Hotak then turned around and came back so that he could protect his family home – and vlog to his thousands of Instagram followers about the evolving situation on the ground in Afghanistan. He has also been keeping a very close eye on his crypto portfolio on Binance, as the local currency touches record lows and nationwide bank closures make it next to impossible to withdraw cash. ""In Afghanistan, we don't have platforms like PayPal, Venmo, or Zelle, so I have to depend on other things,"" said Hotak. Afghanistan still mostly operates as a cash economy, so money in Hotak's crypto wallet won't help him put dinner on his table tonight, but it does give him peace of mind that some of his wealth is safeguarded against economic instability at home. It also offers bigger promises down the road: Access to the global economy from inside Afghanistan, certain protections against spiraling inflation, and crucially, the opportunity to make a bet on himself and a future he didn't think was possible before learning about bitcoin. ""I have very, very, very limited resources to do anything. I'm interested in the crypto world, because I have earned a lot, and I see a lot of potential in myself that I can go further,"" he said.

Run on the banks

For many Afghans, this week has laid bare the worst-case scenario for a country running on legacy financial rails: A nationwide cash shortage, closed borders, a plunging currency, and rapidly rising prices of basic goods. Many banks were forced to shutter their doors after running out of cash this week. Photos featuring hundreds of Kabul residents crowding outside branches in a futile effort to draw money from their accounts went viral.

""There's no bank I can go to right now, no ATM,"" said Ali Latifi, a journalist born and based in Kabul. ""I live above two banks and three ATM machines, but they've been off since Thursday,"" said Latifi, referring to the Thursday before the palace ouster. Without an authority helming the Central Bank, it appears that printing cash to cover the shortfall isn't an option, at least in the short-term. The Western Union has suspended all services and even the centuries-old ""hawala"" system – which facilitates cross-border transactions via a sophisticated network of money exchangers and personal contacts – for now, remains closed.

Sangar Paykhar, a Kabul native currently living in the Netherlands, has been in constant touch with relatives there in recent weeks. He said that many who live paycheck to paycheck were, at first, borrowing money from others to get by, but now, those able to lend out cash have started conserving their funds. ""They've realized the regime has collapsed"" and that those they are lending to ""might not have a job tomorrow,"" said Paykhar. A few days before the Taliban entered Kabul, Musa Ramin was among the people who queued outside a bank in a fruitless attempt to withdraw cash. But unlike other Afghans in line with him that day, months earlier, he had invested a portion of his net worth into crypto. Ramin had been burned before by a rapidly depreciating currency, and decentralized digital money had proven to be a trusted safeguard. In 2020, on what was meant to be a brief layover on a trip from London to Kabul, Ramin got stuck in Turkey. A one-week, mandatory Covid quarantine ballooned into six months. ""I converted all my money to the lira,"" he said. After the Turkish currency began to spiral, Ramin said his capital was cut in half, and he was forced to conserve it. ""That is when I discovered bitcoin."" With all flights cancelled and no other options for departure, Ramin realized he needed to find alternative ways to support himself while stranded in Turkey during the pandemic-related shutdown. That's when he started trading crypto. ""At first, I lost a lot of money,"" he said. But he's since gotten the swing of managing his digital assets, thanks to Twitter and tutorials on YouTube.

Even after returning to Kabul, the 27 year-old says he put all his focus into trading crypto. 80% of his crypto capital is in spot exposure, primarily in major coins, like bitcoin, ethereum, and binance coin. The other 20% he uses to trade futures. ""I was making more money in crypto in a month than in construction in a year,"" said Ramin, though he did acknowledge the risk that's involved. ""It's easy making money in crypto but keeping that wealth is the difficult part."" Despite that volatility, Ramin still sees crypto as the safest place to park his cash. ""If a government isn't formed quickly, we might see a Venezuela-type situation here,"" Ramin told CNBC. He feels virtual tokens are his safest hedge against political uncertainty and plans to increase his exposure to digital currencies in the coming year to as much as 40% of his total net worth.

Ramin isn't alone in his thinking. Google trends data shows that web searches in Afghanistan for ""bitcoin"" and ""crypto"" rose sharply in July just before the coup in Kabul. That said, because this tool is a measure of interest, the spike could be referring to 10 searches or it could be 100,000. But in a country that has long relied on physical cash for virtually all transactions, not many people have the option to let their savings sit in a bank account, let alone a digital wallet. Just take Hotak. He lives in a remote part of Afghanistan where there are no ATMs or bank branches nearby. That means he has to keep a lot of physical cash on hand, in order to cover daily expenses. ""Afghanistan is an unexpected country, and you have to be ready for anything,"" he said. While Hotak thinks that crypto is his future, for now, the bulk of his income comes from day labor jobs, like shoveling, brick work, digging wells, and running a tailor shop that makes clothes.



""Zabul is not a very developed city. It's a village, so that's how I earn,"" he said.

Signs of a growing crypto economy

It's hard to get insight into crypto adoption in Afghanistan. Beyond the fact that measuring cryptocurrency adoption at the grassroots level isn't easy, people actively go out of their way to hide who they are. Some Afghans, for example, will conceal their IP address by using a virtual private network, or VPN, in order to mask their geographic digital footprint. And unlike many crypto boosters – who tend to be vocal and community-driven – digital currency supporters inside Afghanistan often don't want others to know they exist. ""The crypto community in Afghanistan is very small,"" said Hotak. ""They actually don't want to meet each other."" He thinks that could change if the political situation normalizes, but ""for now, everyone just wants to stay hidden until things are nice."" However, new research from blockchain data firm Chainalysis is offering fresh optics on the country's apparently burgeoning peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto network, which is increasingly the most telling metric of adoption in Afghanistan. Hotak, as well as his friends, use Binance's P2P exchange, which allows them to buy and sell their coins directly with other users on the platform.

Chainalysis' 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index gives Afghanistan a rank of 20 out of the 154 countries it evaluated in terms of overall crypto adoption. And when you isolate for its P2P exchange trade volume, Afghanistan jumps up to seventh place. That's a big move in just 12 months: Last year, Chainalysis considered Afghanistan's crypto presence to be so minimal as to entirely exclude it from its 2020 ranking. ""Afghanistan on top makes sense from a capital controls point of view, given it's hard to move money in and out,"" explained Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst. And some experts tell CNBC that Chainalysis could actually be underestimating its overall adoption. ""Unlike many other countries, sanctioned nations don't have good and clear data on P2P markets,"" explained Sobrado. He says that is partly to do with the fact that it is harder to track those transactions.

There are other anecdotal signs of adoption across the country. Nearly a decade ago, sisters and Afghan entrepreneurs Elaha and Roya – both of whom had a focus on computer science at Herat University – founded the Digital Citizen Fund, an NGO that helps women and girls in developing countries gain access to technology. The organization has 11 women-only IT centers in Herat and another two in Kabul, where they teach 16,000 females everything from essential computer skills to blockchain technology. Before classes were suspended earlier this week, creating a crypto wallet was also part of the curriculum. Elaha Mahboob tells CNBC that some students have chosen to secure their money in crypto accounts and a few have specifically started investing in bitcoin and ethereum in order to achieve their long-term financial goals. ""This is especially important as they don't have to worry about not having access to their money, because major banks in Afghanistan have closed,"" Mahboob said. A few Digital Citizen Fund participants have left the country and used the crypto accounts they made in class as a way to transfer their money out. Afghanistan's exposure to the cryptosphere was also taking place inside the presidential palace. Blockchain company Fantom told CNBC it had been working in tandem with the previous government. One such project with the Ministry of Health involved piloting blockchain technology to track counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Fantom says the pilot ""concluded successfully,"" and they had been preparing for national rollout before the Taliban took over. Then there's Sweden-based Bitrefill, an online marketplace that helps customers live on cryptocurrency by exchanging digital coins like bitcoin or dogecoin for gift cards with partner merchants. In Afghanistan, the card offerings include multiple mobile phone service providers, games such as Fortnite and Minecraft, Hotels.com, and Flightgift, which can be redeemed for flights with 300 international airlines. While the company wouldn't share sales numbers on the record with CNBC, Bitrefill does have the endorsement of Janey Gak, who uses it to top up her phone. Her Twitter account has become a must-follow for those who want to understand the situation on the ground through her eyes, but she's also evangelizing the power of bitcoin to transform the country. ""I'm just an ordinary person. I'm not anyone special,"" she said. ""I am just someone who discovered bitcoin a couple of years ago."" In 2018, Gak — who goes by the name ""Bibi Janey"" — started a Facebook page as a hobby to see what Afghans thought of bitcoin. ""I remember getting a lot of comments and questions like, 'Can you explain more?'"" she said. ""People would be fascinated by it, but they would be so confused."" She also got lots of questions about where to buy bitcoin. Since entering this world, she has learned how to code and reads as much as she can about bitcoin. ""I don't trade, I don't do any of that,"" she said. ""I just make some money here and there and save it in bitcoin."" Through her research, she's come to the conclusion that in order for Afghanistan to be a truly sovereign state, it must never borrow money – and adopt a bitcoin standard. To foment wider adoption, Gak commissions articles to be translated to local languages. ""It's not much, but it's a start,"" she told CNBC.

DIY crypto rails

The on-ramp to participating in the crypto economy in Afghanistan is complicated and there are still multiple barriers to entry. Access to the internet, while growing, remains low. There were 8.64 million internet users in Afghanistan in January 2021, according to DataReportal.com and internet penetration stood at 22%. Unreliable electricity poses another major issue, as power outages are common. ""Power goes out once every day for a couple of hours,"" said Ramin, though he noted that it happens in some parts of Kabul more often than others. When CNBC first spoke to Hotak, he was seated near one of the land-crossings into Pakistan, tapping into a WiFi network across the border. ""We don't have proper internet on the Afghanistan side,"" he explained. Hotak also uses solar power to charge his phone, given the country's long-standing issue with electricity outages. Electricity and a stable internet connection are two essential rails for widespread crypto adoption. Also critical is having access to some form of online banking or a credit card that is recognized internationally – which again, poses a big problem for many Afghans. Eighty-five percent of the country is unbanked, according to one U.N. estimate, meaning they do not have a bank account. So people wishing to deal in crypto have to get creative. Hotak and some of his contacts enlist the help of family and friends in neighboring Pakistan or across the Gulf of Oman in the United Arab Emirates, where they have easier access to global markets. ""It's very easy in Pakistan,"" he said. ""Most people have relatives in Dubai, who buy crypto for them using their credit cards."" When the person then wants to liquidate their crypto stake, relatives will sell it for them and use the hawala system, an honor-based system of credit common in Asia and the Middle East, to transfer the funds across the border to Afghanistan. The strategy requires a great deal of trust. In the case of Hotak, his friend in Pakistan doubles as his crypto broker. ""He is a very, very close friend. He has his details on the account that I use, so we could say that it's his account, but I use it,"" Hotak said of the arrangement.

Trust is also key when it comes to judging the quality of trading tips. ""There's a lot of scammers on YouTube and Twitter,"" warned Ramin. When he first started off, he would spend most of his money buying coins promoted by people looking for exit liquidity. ""That's why I stopped trading small-cap coins."" Hotak, on the other hand, has found a reliable online community that offers him sound trading advice. ""There's a few groups on Telegram, WhatsApp, and there's even a Pakistani community on Facebook I follow that gives me the signals to sell. I follow them, and it's been good so far,"" said Hotak. Brokers advertising crypto services on Facebook appear to be operating across the country. Hotak visited one in Herat in early 2020. He went to interview for a job there and says the two-story data center was packed with boys, mostly aged 20 to 25. ""They were all university people,"" he said. ""They all had smartphones in their hands, and they were just scrolling down and down."" CNBC has not spoken with any of these brokerages directly, but Hotak says the site he visited in Herat is still going. Hotak also says that Herat is home to a bitcoin mining farm. ""They had these very big CPUs. Very advanced,"" he said. But Hotak tells CNBC he didn't get to see the entire operation. ""I just got a little glimpse of it."" Blockchain analysts Lorne Lantz and Rieya Piscano say they looked at various data sources and found no sign of bitcoin or ethereum nodes running in Afghanistan, so it is unclear whether this miner in Herat has covered his online footprint, or whether he's cut off his rigs. Even with all of these workarounds, the political turmoil of the last few weeks doesn't make it easy to find time to think about crypto. ""The reality is I cannot focus on crypto trading when the ongoing events in Afghanistan are this intense,"" said Hotak. ""With no electricity and bad internet, crypto trading is near to impossible, so we just hold.""

Path to mass adoption

On Aug. 15, an hour and a half before Ramin's flight bound for Turkey was due to take off, then-President Ghani arrived to the airport in Kabul. After that, Ramin says that all flights were halted and everyone was kicked out. Ramin still has plans to leave, along with his family. But finding a flight is proving to be difficult. He's used his now dwindling supply of afghanis to purchase flights for ten members of his family. He's done this three times, and all three times, the flights were canceled. With travel agencies shut, he remains in a bit of a holding pattern on the ground in Kabul. Ramin is one among many looking to leave the country. Every media outlet on the planet has been circulating the same photos of Afghans clinging to planes, fleeing the country with whatever possessions they can carry. For several, this has meant having to leave a lot behind. Ramin estimates that around 5-10% of his net worth is in crypto, which makes it easier to plan an exit, knowing that there is some money in the bank to tide him over, especially since he doesn't know if he will ever see the money in his bank accounts in Kabul. ""If some type of government doesn't come to existence, then I could potentially see the majority of my wealth being wiped out,"" he said. For now, he and his family are just sitting tight, waiting to catch a flight out. But many people are staying put, in part because they want to foment positive change at home. ""In these circumstances, one can fully appreciate the censorship-resistance property of blockchain-based assets. I believe this is the main driver of the fundamental value of bitcoin and other cryptos,"" said Andrea Barbon, Assistant Professor of Finance at the University of St. Gallen. Gak, for example, thinks that using legacy financial rails like the hawala system might be one of the most effective ways to foster mass adoption. It is a vision she detailed in a prescient story she wrote for Hacker Noon in 2018. She's also thinking about opening her own exchange shop in Kabul. ""The idea is that anyone with bitcoin can exchange it for fiat and then use that to buy goods like always. Anyone who is unable to receive can have their family for example, send the bitcoin to me with a unique address that only the recipient would know just like hawala,"" she explained in a tweet. Ramin has a similar plan to make crypto more accessible to Afghans. ""I hope once I gain more knowledge in blockchain technology to create a team and develop an easily accessible trading platform which Afghans can use,"" he said. There are promising trends on their side. The number of social media users in Afghanistan increased by 22% from 2020 to 2021, and 68.7% of the total population now has a mobile phone connection, according to DataReportal.com. It helps that more than 60% of the population is under 25 and hungry to be a part of the modern economy. Shakib Noori, previously the CEO of a mobile money company in Afghanistan, says this younger demographic also tends to be more tech savvy. Ultimately, CNBC is told that grassroots adoption comes down to one Afghan teaching another about how cryptocurrencies like bitcoin work. Hotak has already mentored three students, and that's just the beginning. ""The Afghan people – they're very complicated. And it's very hard convincing them that digital currency exists,"" he said. ""I have plans to teach people about cryptocurrency in the future...but for now, people are just laying low and waiting to see what happens next.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929612-1629282287651-Screen_Shot_2021-08-18_at_32313_AM.png?v=1629282536',)",none

After a long discussion by the Indian Government over cryptocurrencies in the country, finally a cryptocurrency bill is tabled before the Union Cabinet and everyone is waiting for approval. The bill attempts to regulate virtual currency in India. Presently cryptocurrencies in India are not under any regulation, this makes an unofficial area for Indian investors.

On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the cabinet note was ready on the cryptocurrency bill. She was awaiting Cabinet to clear that, she added.

Under the chairmanship of the Secretary (Economic Affairs), a high-level inter-ministerial panel was formed to explore the issues related to cryptocurrencies and propose specific actions that have already submitted its report. The report advocates that all private cryptocurrencies except the digital currencies that are issued by the state will be forbidden in India.

In the meantime, the RBI discusses the cryptocurrencies traded in the market and has conveyed the same to the government.

Back in May this year, the finance minister conveyed that a very calibrated position is supposed to be taken on crypto and virtual currency as the world is promptly transforming towards technology. Other media reports indicated that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be permitted as an asset class in India.

Highlighting the fact that both the government and the RBI are dedicated to financial strength and solidity, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said there are no differences between the central bank and the Finance Ministry on the matter, and that all should now await the final decision on the matter from the Centre.

Major concerns regarding cryptocurrencies have been identified by the RBI and that the government is in agreement with those concerns, said Mr. Das.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to control the production of its units and validate the transfer of funds, working independently of a central bank.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said, a three-judge bench, led by Justice R F Nariman, is responsible to be set apart on the ground of “proportionality”.

“Therefore, the writ appeals are enabled and the circular dated April 6, 2018, is set apart,” said the bench, which is also involving justices Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency-Bill-What-Will-Be-Indias-Stand-on-Digital-Assets.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,NDTV Gadgets 360,Cardano (ADA) Price Hits All-Time High Ahead of 'Alonzo' Upgrade,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cardano-ada-price-in-india-all-time-high-cryptocurrency-coin-alonzo-upgrade-founder-charles-hoskinson-2515498,"Cardano (ADA) price has jumped more than 50 percent over the last 10 days to occupy the third spot among the world's top cryptocurrencies with an $80 billion (Rs. 5,94,400 crores) market cap, ahead of the popular Binance Coin. During the wild ride, it touched its lifetime high of $2.58 (Rs. 191.70) but the gains had tapered off a bit by Saturday morning. The rally is being attributed to a coming “Alonzo” upgrade that will allow smart-contract functionality and a range of decentralised finance (DeFi) applications to run on the Cardano network. The proposed technological enhancement is likely to land as soon as next month.

Co-founded by Charles Hoskinson, a mathematician and former CEO of Ethereum, the Cardano network is being touted as a serious rival to the Ethereum blockchain, which currently dominates the DeFi services market. The ADA coin has jumped from $1.70 (Rs 126) on August 10 to $2.58 on August 20, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing this report, the Cardano (ADA) price in India was around Rs. 190.

The lack of smart-contract functions has been widely seen as Cardano's biggest drawback and their availability is Ethereum's biggest strength. These contracts are a way to ensure agreements can be validated securely.

Earlier this month, the development team behind the Alonzo upgrade announced the launch of the public test net, saying it was an “exciting and important next step” in the Cardano journey.

This is an exciting and important next step in the #Alonzo journey. In fact, the #Cardano journey. With the support of our OG community testers on the Blue & White phases, #AlonzoPurple will be the first fully public Cardano testnet to support #smartcontracts ????

2/12 — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) August 6, 2021

Despite the rally and even before it over the possibility of the coming upgrade, some people have shown skepticism about the success of the Cardano coin. This had prompted Hoskinson to respond to the naysayers in a tweet earlier this month, promising to start a fund to pay for the therapy of the critics.

It's extraordinary to me the level of skepticism about our upcoming smart contract launch. It's not something like SCs will be underwhelming, but rather it simply won't happen. The critics say it with biblical level certainty. We should start a fund to pay for their therapy — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 4, 2021

Meanwhile, the recent rallies in Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano (ADA), and others have helped the cryptocurrency market to surpass the $2 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,48,50,910 crores) market-cap milestone for the first time since May, when a market crash had routed the volatile trade.

2021-08-23,News18,Bitcoin Maximalists Think Cryptocurrency Could Have Stopped Afghanistan's Takeover. Here's How,https://www.news18.com/news/india/bitcoin-maximalists-think-cryptocurrency-could-have-stopped-afghanistans-takeover-by-taliban-heres-how-4110659.html,"Bitcoin maximalists have been opining that cryptocurrency will and could have been the fix for Afghanistan against Taliban. Some said that war financing could have stopped had crypto been the norm while others empathisized with Afghans worried about their savings as Taliban took over banks.

News18 explains what the maximalists had to say as part of their argument:

How could Bitcoin come to the rescue?

Dr. Josh Cotton, a Bitcoin advocate and founder of MilitaryToken, said in a tweet that “an enormous amount of cash just fell into the hands of the Taliban because cash can’t be truly secured,” adding of course, “Bitcoin fixes this.”

He was hinting towards the enormously secure blockchain technology used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that do not let access to any other individual.

A report by Vice quoted Jimmy Song, one of Bitcoin’s most ardent public advocates saying, “Bitcoin would have prevented the war in Afghanistan had it been the global reserve currency instead of the greenback. No sane government would have spent explicitly taxed dollars on a war that cost that much and lasted that long.”

“The only reason the US could was because of the dollar’s privileged position as the global reserve currency which allowed stealth taxation of the entire world through inflation.”

What is debasement and how are Bitcoiners assuring countries don’t finance war?

Debasement was practiced in the 16th century by England’s King Henry VIII to help fund wars with France and Scotland. The king replaced precious metal content of coins like gold with cheaper metals like copper, reducing the costs of currency production at the expense of taxpayers. Roman emperor Nero used to employ a similar trickery, cutting down on the silver content in the currency. By some estimates, debasement led to annual inflation of around 1,000 percent at one point in Roman history.

Some countries do something similar today, say the proponents of the debasement theory. The government prints more money than it can back up with underlying assets so that it can fund foreign wars, which comes at the expense of citizens in the form of taxes, according to public statements made by various supporters of the theory.

“Bitcoin doesn’t let governments do this crazy deficit spending as they are forced to get loans on the market to do so,” said Jimmy Song.

The idea of inflation as stealth taxation, and its connection with war financing, is one that’s commonly shared by Bitcoin maxis with a libertarian streak

What about Taliban taking over banks and people worrying about savings?

Afghans have been crowding banks trying to access their savings, but mostly in vain.

Not only would Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies make it difficult to confiscate wealth and to keep it safe but the whole situation could have been avoided had the world adopted decentralized money.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be stored on tiny USB thumb drive-sized hardware wallets or on online wallets. A user only needs to remember the corresponding passphrase or key to having access to funds.

2021-08-23,NDTV Gadgets 360,What Is a Blockchain Node and How Is It Used in Cryptocurrency?,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/what-is-a-blockchain-node-how-does-cryptocurrency-work-2515427,"A Node is a part of cryptocurrency that is needed to make most of the popular tokens like Bitcoin or Dogecoin function. It's a fundamental part of the blockchain network, which is the decentralised ledger that is used to maintain a cryptocurrency.

The involvement of a greater number of people in the cryptocurrency market is pushing the desire in them to learn how the system works. This is true for any sector but the newness of cryptocurrency is also leading to curiosity. While you don't really need to understand how blockchain works to be able to benefit from a rise in the price of Bitcoin in India, having a basic understandig of the terms that are thrown around can be useful.

One term you may have heard, but don't know the meaning of, is 'node'. The term is not exclusive to the only cryptocurrency and is widely used outside it. However, a node, in the world of virtual coins, is a computer connected to a cryptocurrency network and can execute certain functions like creating, receiving or sending information.

The explanation can vary depending on the protocol. For example, a resident network may comprise a file server, three laptops and a fax machine. In this case, the network has five nodes, each equipped with a unique MAC address to identify them.

What is a node in blockchain?

The term “node” is being used mostly in relation to blockchain, a decentralised digital ledger that records all cryptocurrency transactions and makes the information available to everyone via a connected device. What this means is every transaction has to be chronologically recorded and distributed to a series of connected devices. These devices are called nodes. These nodes communicate with each other within the network and transfer information about transactions and new blocks.

It is a critical component of the blockchain infrastructure. It helps maintain the security and integrity of the network. A blockchain node's main purpose is to verify each batch of network transactions, called blocks. Each node is distinguished from others by a unique identifier.

What are the types of nodes?

There are basically two types of nodes: full nodes and lightweight nodes.

Full nodes support and provide security to the network. These nodes download a blockchain's entire history to observe and enforce its rules.

Each user in the network is a lightweight node. The lightweight node has to connect to a full node to be able to participate.

Many volunteers run full Bitcoin nodes in a bid to help the Bitcoin ecosystem. As of now, there are roughly 12,130 public nodes running on the Bitcoin network. Other than the public nodes, there are many hidden nodes (non-listening nodes). These nodes usually run behind a firewall.

Miners' nodes

There is also a third type of node: Miner nodes. The term “Bitcoin miners” has now become familiar. These miners are classified as nodes. miner may work alone (solo miner) or in groups (pool miner). A solo miner uses his own full node. In a mining pool, only the administrator can run a full node — which can be referred to as a pool miner's full node.

Listening nodes (supernodes)

And finally, a sub-category called listening nodes. A listening node, essentially, is a publicly visible full node. It communicates with any node that decides to establish a connection with it. A reliable super node typically runs all the time, transmitting blockchain history and transaction data to multiple nodes.","('https://cdn.ndtv.com/tech/images/blockchain_removed_apple_app_store.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Analytics Insight,Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in This Weekend,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-cryptocurrencies-to-invest-in-this-weekend-august-edition/,"Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in This Weekend – August Edition

These cryptocurrencies are showing strong potential in the market.

Cryptocurrencies are growing to become stronger investment options as months go by. Keeping an eye on the crypto trends, a lot of new and seasoned investors are gearing up to make crypto investments. For that, Analytics Insight has made this of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this weekend.

1. Bitcoin

After the crypto market crash in the first half of 2021, experts were anticipating Bitcoin’s rise. After falling from grace, from US$60,000 to US$30,000, Bitcoin has finally crossed the US$45,000 mark. This marks Bitcoin’s potential to give good returns to investors who are looking to make long-term profits.

2. Ethereum

Next to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency. Its blockchain network transformed the DeFi sector and made way for decentralized apps. Recently, Ethereum launched its much-awaited new update that will improve the transaction fees and reduce Ether’s inflation. This change makes it easy for investors to understand the value of investing in Ether and give miners a fair fee.

3. XRP

XRP is purely a utility token created by Ripple. XRP’s blockchain platform aims to set up cross-border currencies without any hindrance. Since its launch, many banks have realized the capabilities of this token and the volume of transactions on this network has increased since then. One of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to buy, XRP has a bright future in the crypto market.

4. Tether

Tether is unlike most cryptocurrencies in the market as it is a stable coin. A stable coin is a digital token that has a fixed value and is pegged to a fiat currency, like the Euro or the Dollar. Similarly, Tether has a fixed value of US$1 or equivalent and maintains US$1 in reserve for each Tether issued.

5. USD Coin

USD Coin is a more popular stable coin as its value is strictly pegged to the US dollar. Stable coins withstand market volatility better and offer a more risk-free investment option.

6. Cardano

Cardano is known for its proof-of-stake network. Its open blockchain platform is open-source and decentralized. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its native token, Ada. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies to invest in.

7. Dogecoin

Dogecoin needs no introduction. It has made enough headlines, thanks to Elon Musk’s obsession with making cryptocurrencies trending. What once started as a joke has now become a legitimate investment option with its value that grew more than 50% since its inception. It’s also one of the cheapest cryptocurrencies to invest in.

8. Binance Coin

Binance Coin is a token native to the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. As long as there is activity on the Binance exchange, Binance coin will continue to steadily grow. Ranked among the top six cryptocurrencies in the world, Binance coin can be used to trade other cryptocurrencies as well.

9. Litecoin

Litecoin is a rival for Bitcoin’s blockchain network. Litecoin aims to pay for everyday goods and services with transactions faster than Bitcoin. Litecoin has been recognized for its practical purpose by market experts and trade merchants. This means Litecoin is a crypto that can suddenly take on a bull run.

10. NEO

Similar to Ethereum, NEO is a platform for smart contracts. Launched in 2014, NEO’s mission is to improve Ethereum’s network by offering the same utility functions via a more sophisticated blockchain. While NEOs network is superior to Ethereum, it will only reach its full potential in a couple of years. The wait will be worth it for investors.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Top-Cryptocurrencies-to-Invest-In-This-Weekend.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Yahoo Finance,"Ethereum: We Got the “Pullback, Rally,” Expect a More Significant Pullback Soon",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-got-pullback-rally-expect-183640779.html,"Last week, see here, I was looking for a smaller degree 4th wave pullback, then a 5th wave rally to complete a larger 1st wave top. Ethereum, aka Ether (ETH), took a slight detour by first rallying to the ideal 161.80% extension for a b-wave and then dropped into this week’s low for what is most likely the c-wave of wave-iv and wave-v (the “Rally”) to ideally $3415-3585 should now be underway. See Figure 1 below.

Figure 1. ETH daily chart with EWP count and technical indicators.

The pullback came and went, now in the rally to complete wave-1

Elliott Wave Principle (EWP) fourth waves are inherently difficult to forecast, track, and trade, and the last few days showed once again this is the case. Namely, what we got was most likely an irregular flat 4th wave, where the (green) b-wave topped above the end of the 3rd wave (red wave-iii). Since corrections, and flat waves, in particular, are always made up of at least three waves (a, b,c), we know that “after wave-b, comes wave-c” and in this case (green) wave-c of (Red) wave-iv bottomed on Wednesday.

Albeit not shown, 4th waves typically retrace between 23.60 and 38.20% of the prior 3rd wave, which would be the $2935-2785 zone. ETH bottomed at $2952 on Wednesday, off by 0.58% and thus close enough (well within the margins of error!). Therefore, as long as this low holds, we should expect ETH to reach the ideal wave-v of the wave-1 target zone of $3415-3585. From there, a multi-week correction, wave-2, should unfold. See Figure 1 above. It can target anywhere between $2145-2865 depending on how deep or shallow this wave-2 will become. It is impossible to know beforehand.

However, typically 2nd waves retrace about 50-62% of the entire prior 1st wave, so I anticipate for now -without having any data at hand yet to confirm a bottom in the $2380-2590 zone (orange rectangle). Once more price data becomes available, I can fine-tune this pending and anticipated low. Remember, all we can do is “anticipate, monitor, and adjust”. But few methods, if any, can already make such forecasts as the EWP can. For now, ETH has topped and bottomed where it should for a smaller 3rd and a 4th wave, so there’s nothing yet to suggest the minor 5th wave and more significant 2nd wave will not unfold as anticipated.

Story continues

Last but not least, please note how price reached the (blue arrow) symmetry breakout target to the T. When classic Technical Analysis and the EWP align, price forecast can be very accurate and reliable. Now “the traffic light” is also back to full green, so I expect higher prices over the next few days.

Bottom line: The devil is always in the details, and one can therefore not foresee every move. The anticipated “pullback” became a bit more complex, but ETH is overall tracking along with the preferred EWP impulse pattern well. As such, my premium crypto trading members knew exactly where to expect the pullback bottom and subsequent rally. Thus, as long as this low holds, we should expect ETH to reach the ideal wave-v of the wave-1 target zone of $3415-3585. From there, I still anticipate a correction back to the mid-$2000s before the rally to new All-time highs should kick in.

2021-08-23,Deseret News,Shiba Inu coin may be on the rise. Here are the latest predictions,https://www.deseret.com/2021/8/20/22633905/shib-coin-shiba-inu-predictions-fall-2021,"The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency token may be rising once again, demonstrating a “bullish” trend as its climbs higher and higher in value.

What’s happening with Shib coin?

Shib coin — a meme-based cryptocurrency that is a nod to the Dogecoin crypto token — has risen by 60% in recent weeks since it reached its lowest value ever in July, according to Investing Cube.

The price has shown there’s still strong support for the crypto token as there has been a significant movement over 25-day and 50-day periods.

Related Why Shib coin is gaining attention again

What are Shib coin predictions?

One prediction from Investing Cube suggests that the coin will see another round of resistance when it reaches a value of $0.0000096. But the trend still points upward for the Shib coin.

Shib coin currently has a high entry price for new investors, and there doesn’t seem to be a massive movement for the coin right now, according to FX Street.

Though cryptocurrency is rising right now, Shiba Inu coin hasn’t had such a strong rise recently, which has made it challenging for new investors to embrace the meme-based cryptocurrency.

How will Shib coin rise again?

According to Investor Place, the coin could use a boost from some social media hype. Specifically, Tesla CEO Elon Musk — who has previously embraced Dogecoin — could drum up enough support if he were to mention the coin again, per Investor Place.","('https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l4HoBPUYmevYz_yQsk4Yg2WBqL8=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524142/Dogecoin_4.jpg',)",none

All but five of the 76 tradable assets on Coinbase Global Inc.’s (NASDAQ:COIN) platform are trading higher Friday.

Ethereum Classic was up 2.51% at $67.48 at last check.

Ethereum Classic Daily Chart Analysis

Ethereum Classic looks to be forming a cup pattern (orange) inside of a sideways channel. The price is now starting to approach a previous resistance level.

The crypto trades above both the 50-day moving average (green) and the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating recent sentiment has been bullish.

These moving averages may both hold as an area of support in the future.

The $80 level has held as resistance multiple times in the past and may act as resistance again as the price nears the level. The cup may hold as support as the stock continues its upward push.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also has been moving higher and now sits at 63. This shows that there has been more buying pressure in the stock than selling pressure.

What’s Next For Ethereum Classic?

Bullish traders are looking to see Ethereum Classic continue to move higher above the cup pattern. Bulls are looking to see the price cross above resistance and be able to hold above the $80 level.

Bearish traders would like to see Ethereum Classic fall below the cup pattern and head back toward $40 support. Eventually bears would like to see the price fall below the $40 support and hold as a resistance level. This could cause a further downward push.","('https://cdn2.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/blockchain-3448502_1920_180.jpg?width=720',)",none
2021-08-23,East Idaho News,Cryptocurrency mining company removes barriers and simplifies the process for customers,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2021/08/cryptocurrency-mining-company-removes-barriers-and-simplifies-the-process-for-customers/,"IDAHO FALLS – Cryptocurrency has become an increasingly popular investment option in the last several years.

A local company capitalizes on this trend by mining for it.

Braxton Ball is the operations manager and co-owner of T-Ball Miners, a company that has been hosting miners for the last six years in an Idaho Falls warehouse. The warehouse houses a large network of computers that process cryptocurrency transactions around the world.

“Just like Visa has a data center that processes U.S. dollar transactions, Bitcoin transactions are processed with Bitcoin miners. As a reward, people that mine Bitcoin get paid in Bitcoin,” Ball tells EastIdahoNews.com.

Bitcoin is just one type of cryptocurrency T-Ball deals with. Others include Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Zcash.

Each computer is equipped with a mining unit that processes these digital transactions, which are added to a worldwide pool and distributed among each miner.

“The miners are trying to solve a math equation, and it’s called a block. When they solve a block, it makes the next block in the blockchain,” says Ball. “We connect our miners with miners around the world, and we all work together to solve the same equation at the same time.”

Each miner is rewarded, depending on how much work they put into solving the equation, he says, and there’s a monthly fee to do it. Without miners, Ball says cryptocurrency transactions would not be possible. See what it’s like in the video player above.

Braxton Ball poses for a photo in front of the computer network that mines cryptocurrency. | Rett Nelson, EastIdahoNews.com

Ball was introduced to cryptocurrency as a day trader in the stock market about six years ago. It first popped on his radar when people started trading Bitcoin.

“It started popping up a lot and I saw people were trading Bitcoin because the markets never close,” he says.

As he did some more research, he started asking himself why you would buy Bitcoin if you could make it.

RELATED | Good Question: What is bitcoin?

“If you buy one Bitcoin, in a year you’ll have one Bitcoin. If you buy one Bitcoin with the miners, in a year you might have four Bitcoins,” says Ball. “We see mining as the cheapest way to obtain cryptocurrency, and it’s a great passive revenue stream.”

A massive amount of power is required to run a cryptocurrency mining company. Ball says T-Ball Miners consumes one kilowatt-hours worth of electricity every second. Idaho Falls was selected as a location because it has one of the cheapest power rates in the nation.

Ball is also married to his co-owner’s daughter, who is from Idaho Falls.

Since 2015, Ball says the cryptocurrency market has continued to evolve. Today, there are 10,000 different types of cryptocurrency, and more companies are starting to use it.

“I lived in California for a while, and almost all the restaurants there accept it,” he says.

Visa and Mastercard offer a Bitcoin debit card that will convert it into dollars when you swipe it. Tom Tueller, the other co-owner in the business, says there’s an apartment complex in Rexburg that accepts rent payments in Bitcoin.

“And companies like Walmart and Apple are posting job openings every day for cryptocurrency specialists,” Ball says.

Both Ball and Tueller say cryptocurrency is the trend of the future and will eventually become the norm.

“It’s already been proposed in the U.S. Senate that every U.S. citizen will be given a digital address. That’s how they originally wanted to send out all the stimulus checks last year,” Ball says. “It was declined, but the fact that it’s already been proposed tells you where the future is headed.”

Regardless of your experience or level of understanding with cryptocurrency, Ball says T-Ball Miner’s job is to remove all the barriers and simplify the process for everyone.

“You don’t have to understand the entire industry to get into mining. We take all the technical out of it,” says Ball.

2021-08-23,Yahoo Finance,Galaxy Digital floats blockchain fund as bet on cryptocurrency's booming DeFi movement,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/galaxy-digital-floats-blockchain-fund-as-bet-on-cryptocurrencys-booming-de-fi-movement-171702712.html,"As the nascent concept of decentralized finance (DeFi) gains traction in cryptocurrency trading — and draws more regulatory scrutiny — new players are creating products to meet rising demand.

Enter Galaxy Digital (GLXY.TO), which this week rolled out a DeFi Index Fund, their newest blockchain-based financial asset. The passive instrument tracks the performance of Bloomberg’s Galaxy DeFi Index, and is part of an estimated $80 billion industry that's poised for explosive growth in the coming years.

DeFi is not a new segment of the crypto space, but it has grown exponentially in the past year from $6.8 billion to $80 billion, according to data from DeFi Pulse.

Ben Samaroo, the CEO of a DeFi platform called WonderFi, explained to Yahoo Finance recently that the sector ""presents a faster, cheaper way to do finance."" He added that DeFi allows users to borrow money ""instantly"" without bank approval, or earn higher-than-average interest on assets.

Galaxy Digital's new fund is an attempt to offer clients a lower risk, and more regulatory-friendly way, to gain exposure to DeFi. The fund has been seeded by NZ Funds, a $2 billion institution that manages retirement savings accounts for New Zealanders.

NZ Funds is not a newcomer to investing in the crypto space. Previously, the retirement savings institution seeded Galaxy Digital’s Ethereum (ETH-USD) fund earlier this year. Before that, it took part in a $50 million private investment in Galaxy Digital Holdings’s public equity.

The Index is composed of 9 DeFi protocols in portions of 40 to 1 percent exposure. The protocols will be considered for addition and removal on a monthly basis.

While index funds aren’t intended to be actively managed, the removal or addition of DeFi protocols will rely on Bloomberg's principles for measuring an index such as data integrity, diversification, representation and continuity.

Growing scrutiny, and opportunities to profit

Bloomberg's Galaxy DeFi Index compared with Bitcoin and Ethereum

DeFi is a family of crypto assets and underlying protocols which together form a complex financial system that relies most heavily on the Ethereum blockchain. Like much of the crypto world, DeFi's key selling point is stripping out the middle man in trading, which cuts costs and red tape.

Using self-executing (or ""smart"") digital contracts, developers can build applications on top of Ethereum and other blockchains. They are then used to devise new ways to borrow, lend and exchange assets in faster and cheaper ways than traditional finance.

While these projects cut out traditional intermediaries in the financial sector via peer-to-peer networks, not all DeFi protocols may be decentralized enough to skirt regulation. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said as much in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published this week, in which he suggested the agency would be taking a closer look at the sector.

Meanwhile, a widening range of big money players are now gawking at cryptocurrency and blockchain-based protocols, trying to understand whether crypto is supposed to fit in their portfolios. And for many traditional investors, taking the plunge requires some level of valuation.

Nick Juhle, director of research for wealth management firm Greenleaf Trust, faces this problem. With a total of $17 billion in assets under advisement, Greenleaf provides wealth management to approximately 1000 high-net worth individuals.

Since 2017, Juhle has received calls from clients every time Bitcoin's price surges, asking why the firm hasn't parked any cash in crypto. Yet Juhle still won't budge, because his team hasn't found a way to value it based on traditional valuation frameworks like cash flow and earnings results.

""The challenge with crypto, Bitcoin being the prime example, is that it doesn't really have intrinsic value. You can price it but you can't really value it. That's always the issue that we've run into,"" says Juhle. At this point, valuing the best DeFi protocols runs into the same issue for Juhle.

However, there is no unifying collective valuation framework for DeFi, according to Steve Kurz, Galaxy Digital’s Head of Asset Management. It's a clear barrier for more traditional retail and institutional investors with no crypto exposure, even if they are willing to accept the higher volatility synonymous with crypto.

Currently, the Galaxy Digital team uses “different strands” of metrics, such as the total value locked in protocols and other network usage statistics, to measure potential returns similar to how early stage venture capital performs valuation. Given time, the DeFi Index could provide one more strand for measurement.

“We are marching toward a collective valuation framework that's not quite ready for institutional primetime, but there’s enough to say as a venture [capital] bet, absolutely, DeFi can make sense in a portfolio,” Kurz told Yahoo Finance in an interview.

Juhle prefers the idea of an index fund that invests in the DeFi theme broadly, as opposed to ""betting on a specific protocol."" He also remains wary of the DeFi index's current correlation with the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum.

""Perhaps it will diverge over time as the market matures,"" Juhle suggested.

2021-08-23,Yahoo Finance,Blockchain: What is it and what does it have to do with crypto?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blockchain-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-crypto-171503722.html,"Blockchain is a type of database composed of a growing list of records, individually known as blocks, that are chained together through computer cryptography. The goal of blockchain is to allow for the recording and distribution of digital information that is unable to be tampered with.

Unlike a typical database where data is electronically stored in a “table” format, data within a blockchain is stored within its connected blocks, with each block containing information about the block that came before it. It is this characteristic that creates a resistance to modification of a blockchain’s data, because a change to one block’s information would require the alteration of all subsequent blocks created. And although blockchains are not entirely unalterable, as a collectively agreed-upon update to the network may be known as a “fork,” blockchains are designed to be foundationally secure.

Blockchains are typically managed through a peer-to-peer network of computers working together to serve as a publicly distributed ledger of data (or transactions). Every node in the network follows a specific protocol which the entire blockchain adheres to in order to validate new blocks and communicate with each other.

What does blockchain have to do with cryptocurrencies?

Although blockchain comes up in nearly every conversation involving cryptocurrencies, the two terms cannot be used interchangeably. Rather, blockchain is the network and platform through which cryptocurrency is transacted and generated. For example, the ether (ETH-USD) cryptocurrency operates through the ethereum blockchain.

Blockchain technology had been discussed in scientific literature for nearly two decades before the advent of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ether — the two largest by market cap — with cryptocurrencies becoming one of the first and most widely known applications of blockchain. In 2009, an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto” invented the first cryptocurrency through the bitcoin blockchain to serve as a public ledger for transactions of bitcoin.

Story continues

One of the most significant solutions that a digital currency through blockchain technology provides is an answer to the double-spending problem. In addition, it provides this solution along with all of its functionality without the need for a trusted central authority or server. As mentioned previously, because a blockchain network consists of computer nodes which can be located anywhere in the world, blockchains, and therefore cryptocurrencies, operate as completely decentralized platforms.

Decentralization, along with the pseudo-anonymity offered by cryptocurrency as a means of saving and payment — as cryptocurrency wallets do not require verification such as state identification to use — is one of the themes that has made blockchain technology and cryptocurrency so popular and controversial. Other potential benefits offered by blockchain as a currency platform include 24/7, 365-day operation, transaction fees determined by a market, speed, security, and ease of access.

Other blockchain applications

Although cryptocurrency is undoubtedly the most famous application of blockchain, blockchain technology can be used for many other practical applications as well. For example, the banking and finance industry could benefit greatly from blockchain’s speed, security, and lack of set hours of operation. Other areas of society and business that could stand to benefit from usage of this technology include federal currencies, the healthcare industry, supply chains, and even democratic elections. Each of these could leverage one or all of the previously mentioned benefits that blockchain has to offer.

2021-08-23,Markets Insider,Cardano surges 25% in 2 days to become 3rd-largest cryptocurrency as new protocol upgrade looms,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/cardano-price-crypto-ethereum-binance-alonzo-protocol-upgrade-market-cap-2021-08,"Cardano ada SOPA images

Cardano jumped 25% in a two-day surge that catapulted it to the third-biggest cryptocurrency.

The surge was fueled by a looming protocol upgrade to cardano called Alonzo that would bring full-functionality smart contracts to the blockchain.

Cardano's last major leap - just last week - was also driven by Alonzo upgrade news.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Cardano jumped 25% in a two-day surge that catapulted the ethereum competitor to the third-biggest cryptocurrency, edging out Binance coin but still short of ether.

Cardano's ada token leaped to as high as $2.58 on Friday from a Wednesday closing price of $2.05. The token, launched in 2017, has seen startling growth in 2021, exploding 1367% in price this year.

The surge was fueled by a looming protocol upgrade to cardano called Alonzo that would bring full-functionality smart contracts to the blockchain, in a clear challenge to ethereum. The upgrade is set for early October, though some market participants are skeptical of that launch date, according to CoinDesk. The upgrade was previously bumped from September to October.

The higher price made Cardano's ada the third-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap at more than $80 billion, ahead of Binance coin at $69 billion. However, it still has a ways to go before displacing ethereum, worth some $380 billion.

Cardano's last major leap - just last week - was also driven by Alonzo upgrade news. Investors ""were hyped on the optimism that a supposedly superior blockchain infrastructure with the possibility to support the next generation of smart contracts is on the horizon,"" executive director of crypto exchange CEX.IO Konstantin Anissimov told Insider at the time.

Cardano's price action comes as interest grows in exploring ethereum alternatives. Users have long complained that ethereum's high ""gas"" fees limit the cryptocurrency's reach, a problem that the recent EIP-1559 protocol upgrade is trying to address.

Cardano was trading at $2.54 as of 12:05 p.m. ET, up 19.4% in the last 24 hours.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/611fd4731c47770019e69bd3?format=jpeg',)",none
2021-08-23,The Motley Fool,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Are All Soaring Today",https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/20/why-bitcoin-ethereum-and-dogecoin-are-all-soaring/,"What happened

Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) are up 6.82%, 8.16%, and 8.36% in the past 24 hours. As of 10:30 a.m. EDT, they are now trading at $48,518.76 per coin, $3,293.94 per token, and $0.3319 apiece, respectively.

Earlier in the day, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN), the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, announced it would be adding $500 million worth of cryptocurrency to its balance sheet. The move sent the whole sector into a monstrous rally. Coinbase stock is also up 3.10% to $255.98 per share in the same period.

So what

It's not just Coinbase's big move that investors are happy about. On Aug. 19, the second-largest mortgage lender in the U.S., UWM Holdings, announced it would start accepting Bitcoin for home loans. The adoption could take effect by the end of the third quarter, and the company is also considering adding other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum into the mix.

Speaking of Ethereum, it was revealed on the same day that the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract had become the largest holder of Ether -- at $21.3 billion. The news illustrates growing confidence in the Ethereum Foundation's transition to its 2.0 network. By the end of 2022, Ethereum will run a proof-of-stake protocol, which its development team estimates will cut its energy use by 99% -- essentially wiping out concerns about its environmental sustainability.

As for Dogecoin, the once-meme digital currency is growing in recognition. During popular discount brokerage Robinhood Markets' earnings release on Aug. 18, the company disclosed that Dogecoin accounted for 62% of cryptocurrency revenue in the second quarter. The same day, Ethereum's founder Vitalik Buterin announced he would be joining the development team behind Dogecoin as a board member.

Now what

Dogecoin is leaving behind its reputation as a joke cryptocurrency. Since the beginning of the year, the number of merchants accepting Doge as payment has grown by 34.7% to 1,616. In addition, the network has found its unique niche due to its slight inflationary nature. Dogecoin miners do not face the threat of their high-tech GPU mining rigs becoming redundant with the rise of PoS protocols. At the same time, the mining isn't so difficult as to induce heavy electricity use.

Bitcoin's slow, archaic, and environmentally unfriendly protocol is finally getting an overhaul, too. In a rare act of solidarity, miners worldwide reached the consensus for Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade, which will allow smart contract adoption on its network and is scheduled to take effect in November. Bitcoin has no central development team, so it's up to a unanimous vote from miners to upgrade the world's biggest cryptocurrency. The last one happened four years ago.

Overall, investors' fear, uncertainty, and doubt -- known in the cryptocurrency world as FUD -- regarding the sector in Q2 are melting away very quickly as new innovations are beginning to address these issues. It's looking like the start of the next bull run for the cryptocurrency sector.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640139/gettyimages-1171929176.jpg',)",none

However, crypto experts say they are hoping for the best.Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of crypto trading platform Mudrex , says, ""We could expect an accommodative and progressive stance by the government towards cryptocurrencies. The government is expected to evaluate all possible aspects. All these events transpire to positive expectations from the cryptocurrency bill.""An inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency, under the secretary (economic affairs), had studies issues around virtual currencies and proposed specific actions in its report.Looking at the growing opportunities in this space, Siddharth Menon, COO of cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, says calibrated regulations that encourage the industry and safeguard consumers will help the ecosystem grow. ""We don't know the details but we expect it to be positive. Once we have more details, we will comment. Else it will be purely speculative,"" Menon adds.Some experts say India cannot be as a laggard when the world is rapidly moving ahead with blockchain technology. This has led to reports that crypto as an asset class might be allowed in India but the government will not accept it as legal tender as yet.Crypto enthusiasts are betting on analyst views that say there might not be a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies. Menon is among those who does not think a blanket ban is possible. The government has understood crypto assets are not a threat to national currency. ""Also, this is a new and growing global fintech industry. India cannot stay behind,"" he adds.Nobody is yet certain about the government's stance in the bill, says Patel, but adds: ""Legislation without a blanket ban would undoubtedly boost the crypto ecosystem in India.""Experts say there is a healthy startup ecosystem that has sprawled up around digital currencies. India has about 15 million people trading in cryptos , said a Bloomberg report in June.Sharan Nair, Chief Business Officer at crypto exchange platform CoinSwitch Kuber, says, investors should not panic. ""The government would ensure that investor interest is protected at all cost.""In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had advised all entities regulated by it to not deal in digital currencies. In 2020, the Supreme Court set aside the central bank’s 2018 circular and allowed banks and financial institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrencies. In May 2021, the RBI permitted banks to facilitate cryptos. ""There are no differences between the central bank and the finance ministry,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said.Negative news from the government will have impact just like it did in 2018, when most of the entrepreneurs either stopped working in this space or left the country, says Menon. ""After the RBI lifted the ban, we have seen a lot more interest among entrepreneurs and tech talent to enter this space. More crypto projects have been born since then,"" he adds.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85489438,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-271455,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,KSDK,"Bitcoin for everyone: Missouri mayor wants to give each resident $1,000 in cryptocurrency",https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/investigations/missouri-mayor-wants-to-give-residents-1000-bitcoin/63-a329a9ad-fb82-42a5-a835-8d08e47d428b,"Cool Valley Mayor Jayson Stewart is raising funds to give each resident up to $1000 in Bitcoin. The only catch? They can't sell it

COOL VALLEY, Mo. — A tiny Missouri town could become the first in the country to put Bitcoin in the hands of every resident.

Jayson Stewart, the Mayor of Cool Valley says he is raising funds to give each of the town’s roughly 1500 inhabitants a piece of the digital currency.

Many experts expect Bitcoin to grow in value exponentially in the next decade.

“My daughter says she thinks it's the next big thing. The digital currency,” said Ramona Nickels, a mail carrier who lives in Cool Valley.

“Look, it's digital gold,” said Mayor Stewart. “I would like to see every single household in my city receive some level of Bitcoin, whether it be $500 or $1,000.”

So what is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is one of many cryptocurrencies available today.

It is considered the most well-known cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has been around since 2008.

Think of Bitcoin like regular money. Except it's not issued by any country or impacted by traditional inflation.

You don't need a bank to use, store or transfer Bitcoin. It's completely online. Some economists believe if Bitcoin’s value keeps increasing at its current rate, it could one day become the world's currency.

Recently, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin it's legal tender. It was a move made to protect the country’s economy from rapidly rising inflation.

In Cool Valley, Stewart thinks holding the digital currency could be transformational.

“I have friends whose lives have been completely changed, like going from working a regular nine to five job to being worth over 80 million dollars in a matter of a few years,” said Stewart, who calls himself an Entrepreneur and Environmentalist.

Stewart said most of the money to fund the plan will come from several unnamed Bitcoin investors.

“I have some very supportive donors who have agreed to match any money that I raise up to several millions of dollars,” said Stewart. “I'm trying to get a few government funds as well to go along with that. Or potentially some of the relief money that comes in from the Covid relief.""

But Stewart isn’t ruling out using city funds, saying “It's possible. We'll see how it goes. We'll see how it goes.”

Save it, don’t sell it

Stewart says the Bitcoin will come with some strings attached. He doesn’t want residents to sell for a few years.

“We're putting in place like a vesting schedule for Bitcoin. The idea is that maybe you don't touch it for five years before you really get full access to it. We're working on ideas like that because that's my number one concern. Someone just sells their bitcoin to pay their car note. And then when Bitcoin is sitting at like $500,000 all these years later, they're going to really regret that,” said Stewart.



Roughly 1500 people live in Cool Valley. The dozen or so the I-Team spoke with seemed receptive to the plan.

“With cash people have bad habits and they buy things they shouldn't be buying. But with Bitcoin, maybe you can give it to your kids. My daughter is going to college next year. I could give [the Bitcoin] to her,” said Nickels.

“Putting money in my pocket! Sounds pretty good to me,” said Cornelius Webb, who lives in Cool Valley.

“I believe that Cool Valley is going to get wealthier and wealthier , not just our city, but the actual people who live here,” said Stewart.

Stewart said the city is also going to take proactive measures to off set the environmental impact Bitcoin mining is known to have.

“We're giving away Bitcoin and at the same time we're converting our entire city to solar, like all of the government lights and things like that,” said Stewart.

Details about how Bitcoin will be distributed are still unclear.

Stewart said it will involve door knocking and offering free classes to residents about how to use and securely store Bitcoin. He hopes to kick things off by the end of the year.","('https://media.ksdk.com/assets/KSDK/images/0bd7cda4-f1df-46f7-8b22-392dfe1e8477/0bd7cda4-f1df-46f7-8b22-392dfe1e8477_1140x641.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,Coinbase is buying $500 million in crypto and investing future profits into a crypto portfolio,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/coinbase-is-buying-500-million-in-crypto-and-investing-future-profits-into-a-crypto-portfolio.html,"The logo for Coinbase Global Inc, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is displayed on the Nasdaq MarketSite jumbotron and others at Times Square in New York, U.S., April 14, 2021.

Coinbase will buy $500 million in crypto on its balance sheet and allocate 10% of its quarterly profits into a crypto assets portfolio, company executives announced late Thursday.

The company plans to invest in ""Ethereum, Proof of Stake assets, DeFi tokens, and many other crypto assets supported for trading on our platform,"" becoming the first public company to do so, finance chief Alesia Haas said in a blog post.

CEO Brian Armstrong first revealed the brokerage's plans in an earlier tweet, saying he expects the allocation to grow as the market matures. He also indicated the company's ambitions to diversify its crypto services and operations, which mostly center around trading.

""Hopefully over time we can operate more of our business in crypto,"" Armstrong said on Twitter. ""Today it is still a mix.""

The price of bitcoin climbed higher on the news, passing $47,000 on Friday after sitting below $45,000 the previous two days. Coinbase shares rose more than 3% higher in early trading Friday.

The few companies that have included bitcoin in their holdings, like Microstrategy and Tesla (with the help of Coinbase), have done so as a hedge against inflation and potential devaluation of the U.S. dollar. On Thursday, Citi placed Microstrategy's rating under review, suspending its price target and estimates due to its investment in bitcoin and correlation to the digital currency's price.

The news comes a week after Palantir reported quarterly results showing it bought $50 million in physical gold to reportedly hedge against black swan events. Palantir also said it's accepting customer payments in bitcoin, but that none have used the option.

That same week, Coinbase reported quarterly earnings and growth metrics that wowed analysts, who are mostly patient about the stock's correlation to bitcoin's price and volatility and optimistic about its plans to drive long-term innovation throughout the financial system.

Haas said the investments will be driven by its custodial crypto balances and deployed ""over a multi-year window using a dollar cost averaging strategy."" She added that Coinbase is investing for the long term and ""will only divest under select circumstances, such as an asset delisting from our platform.""

Oppenheimer's Owen Lau said he doesn't expect the new investment policy to lower the correlation between Coinbase and bitcoin ""materially in the near future."" However, he said he sees it as a signal that Coinbase can ""further facilitate and influence both retail and institutional adoption"" over time by integrating cryptocurrencies into its own operations, like paying vendors and employees, for example.

The news follows a Wall Street Journal report this week that Coinbase has stockpiled $4 billion in cash to weather regulatory headwinds. Lau noted the company still has plenty of cash on hand despite the transaction.

""Share repurchases and dividends appear to be off the table at least near term, but we believe management will use excess capital to reinvest in the business and make acquisitions, especially in international presence and subscription-based business,"" he added.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106868176-1618411319630-106868176-16184112292021-04-14t143834z_1561353557_rc2qvm91n6cr_rtrmadp_0_coinbase-ipo.jpg?v=1618411334',)",none
2021-08-23,TechCrunch,OnlyFans’ porn ban is crypto’s opportunity of a lifetime – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-porn-ban-is-cryptos-opportunity-of-a-lifetime/,"Today, OnlyFans dropped the massive bombshell that it will be banning “sexually explicit content” from the app later this year. This is obviously a wildly seismic shift for OnlyFans, which completely disrupted the adult content industry and gave performers a path toward greater independence by allowing them to connect directly with their fans via subscriptions. This shutdown is also the opportunity of a lifetime for the crypto industry, which could capitalize on the shutdown and a recent wave of increasingly consumer-friendly crypto payments infrastructure products to create a platform that won’t crumble under the influence of payment providers.

OnlyFans, which has been trying to raise at a unicorn valuation and running into plenty of trouble doing so despite huge revenues, didn’t mince words on the reasoning for today’s fundamental change. “These changes are to comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers,” a statement on the news from OnlyFans partially read.

Despite popular culture’s ongoing destigmatization of sex work and adult content, banking institutions are still fundamentally conservative and wary to handle money flowing through these platforms. Most of the operators of these platforms are forced to deal with constant uneasiness of knowing their platforms might one day lose favor among these providers and instantly lose everything. All the while, “vice clauses” present in plenty of venture capital firms’ underpinnings keep them from operating in these spaces as well, and prevent these platforms from accessing growth capital. It’s clear that adult content platforms are probably never going to have a friendly relationship with these financial institutions and it’s likely time for the platforms — and the creators using them — to move on.

In a lot of ways, OnlyFans dumping porn seems like an outright betrayal of their creator network, and is something those creators will be sure to remember when embracing whatever copycats spring up in their wake. They are likely going to look at new platforms with renewed skepticism in how they’ll handle payment provider standoffs, but there likely isn’t going to be a different outcome for ambitious platforms looking to grow. That would likely be a different situation for crypto-native platforms, but given the tiny adoption, it’s still a substantial risk for creators to embrace a platform on which their fans might not know how to pay for content.

The porn industry has been embracing crypto payments, albeit slowly. In 2018, Pornhub first announced that they would begin accepting cryptocurrency payments. Fast-forward to 2020, when Visa and Mastercard dumped the platform; now crypto payments and ACH bank transfers are the only ways to pay for its premium subscription service. There are already a few crypto platform players in this space, like CumRocket and SpankChain, catering to niche audiences (and probably in need of rebranding), but with the OnlyFans juggernaut out of the way, there might actually be a space for an existing or upstart player to innovate and capture this market.

The real challenge is in making it simple to onboard new users to both a new platform and potentially their first crypto wallet — while staying compliant with regulatory guidelines — at a time when more conventional web payment structures have gotten so streamlined and free adult content is just as prolific as ever. Know your customer (KYC) guidelines that push users to upload their passport or driver’s license to verify crypto purchases probably aren’t the easiest onboarding ask for a new crypto porn site, but as the market matures a bit and the challenges of a user setting up their first wallet are decoupled from the onboarding process for the platform, there are plenty of benefits to be realized.

Porn has always been a launchpad of sorts for new technologies. While the popularity of crypto has surged in recent months and nearly eclipsed $2 trillion in total assets, crypto penetration among the apps that people are actually using remains extremely low. As new solutions and startups pop up aiming to demystify buying and sending crypto, it feels like there’s a chance the industry could be in the perfect place to fill the void left by OnlyFans’ exit and build a more innovative platform in its image that goes all-in on crypto.","('https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/onlyfans-cryptocurrency.jpg?w=711',)",none

It is now the third most valuable cryptocurrency .

. The rally in the crypto asset's value is being attributed to an update that will extend the smart contracting mechanism to the blockchain.

It’s often called “ethereum killer” because of its potential of taking on the mightier crypto with an improved smart contracting system.

The new update will open Cardano to the world of DeFi, NFT, and other automated transaction systems.

Cardano has hit a new all-time high, rising over 20% in the last 24 hours, with its price peaking at $2.55. The cryptocurrency that is powering Charles Hoskinson’s public blockchain has regained the spot of being the third-largest crypto with a whopping $80 billion market cap.The Cardano blockchain's cryptocurrency is called ADA, and the system is often touted to be a direct Ethereum and Solana competitor. It has surpassedCoin and is now the third most valuable crypto after Bitcoin and Ethereum.The rally in the crypto asset's value is attributed to the Alonzo Purple public test net launch. It's the final test phase of the project, which will end in the network finally getting smart contracts capability.The entire crypto market has witnessed a bullish rally in the previous week, pushing its market cap to more than $2 trillion. While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to lead the race, new altcoins are constantly challenging the norm. The price dips from the last two months have not seemed to affect the digital asset's price too much, as it's now back well over $2. It reached an all-time high previously in May, remaining just a little shy of $2.5.The upcoming ‘Alonzo’ upgrade is driving the bullish sentiment. The development team announced the launch of the public test net on Twitter. Incorporating smart contracts is critical for the blockchain as it introduces a range of new capabilities such as DeFi (decentralised finance), NFT (non-fungible token), automated lending, and more.The new update is likely to land on September 12, and investors are confident that it'll be a game-changer. Often called the ""ethereum killer,"" it's four times the size of Solana in terms of market cap but has little practical use-case right now.On the flip side, Japanese authorities have permitted it to float on exchanges in the country. While crypto regulations worldwide are at a nascent stage, Japan's decision is also cited as an indirect mark of due diligence and compliance.Smart or blockchain contracts are unique in the way that they ensure compliance between the two parties. Immutability is one of the most remarkable features of a self-executing contract. It means it is impossible to reverse, alter, or tamper the codes, rules, and even the transactions once programmed on the blockchain.Like traditional contracts, smart contracts are agreements between two or more parties, avoiding the need for vigilance or enforcement from third parties.It's self-executing and impossible to reverse, alter, or tamper with the code, internal regulations, and transactions. The blockchain network maintains a transparent, secure, and immutable transaction ledger that ensures proof of ownership is also established and transferable. Contract negotiation and application become far more accessible, and all the edit history of the transaction is also transparently available.Furthermore, it can also be deployed for DAOs (decentralised autonomous organisations), which require communities to be bound to specific rules coded into blockchain contracts combined with governance mechanisms.Ethereum is infamous for its smart contracting ability and was created by Vitalik Buterin and four other co-founders in 2013. Polkadot, EOS, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and many others still compete for the throne, but none of them can defeat the industry's first mover.

Asian countries are outpacing the rest of the globe in terms of cryptocurrency adoption. According to a recent analysis from market research firm Finder, the top five nations in terms of bitcoin ownership are all located in Asia. Most of them were considered unimportant in the cryptocurrency industry; however, a recent study contradicts the same.The Asian country with the highest percentage of cryptocurrency ownership was Vietnam, at 40 per cent, followed by Indonesia, India , Malaysia, and the Philippines, respectively. 30 per cent of individuals polled in Indonesia and India stated that they held cryptocurrency.According to media reports, India also ranked #2 in a poll of nations that use cryptocurrency the most, with 9% of the respondents claiming they used crypto. Meanwhile, the United States and the United Kingdom had the lowest proportion of cryptocurrency owners, with 8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.After the Supreme court ruled out the RBI ban on crypto transactions, there has been a massive increase in retail investors. CoinSwitch Kuber , the largest cryptocurrency platform in India, has onboarded nearly 8 Million users since June 2020.One trend that has been consistent around the globe is that younger people are leading the charge when it comes to cryptocurrency adoption. Young people between the ages of 18 and 34 make for more than 40% of users throughout the world, according to Finders One of the main reasons behind this is the growth of crypto-based companies such as CoinSwitch Kuber, making crypto investing easy and accessible to individuals.The user base also consisted primarily of those aged 35 to 44, with 17 per cent belonging to those in their 45 to 54-year-old. Also, in nations such as Colombia and Netherlands, crypto adoption is seen majorly among the elderly ie, those above the age of 65.Smaller towns in India have been at the forefront of cryptocurrency acceptance in recent years. The increase in user subscriptions from Tier II and Tier III locations on the CoinSwitch Kuber app have grown by over 2000%.Studies show that the adoption of the crypto market has grown by over 880% between June 2020 - June 2021 worldwide and the number of crypto users in India has crossed over 15 million during this time.Recently, there has been a flurry of activity in India’s cryptocurrency space, with the government working towards acting on laws and investors pouring money into crypto companies. Recently, CoinSwitch Kuber raised $25 million in their Series B round from a VC giant named Tiger Global at a $500 million valuation.According to a poll conducted by global consultancy company PwC, India can be among the leaders in the adoption of the overlying blockchain technology that crypto is based on, over the next five years, if an appropriate degree of business and government engagement is achieved.Sharan Nair, the CBO of CoinSwitch Kuber , stated that “The cryptocurrency industry is steaming hot. 2021 has seen an accelerated interest in the crypto space as companies look to gain exposure to the market. Several sectors floundered in FY21, given the challenges of doing business in a pandemic environment. Fintech, for the most part, was not one of them.”Around 15 million Indians are believed to have made investments in private cryptocurrency holdings. Cryptocurrency investments in the nation increased from $923 million in April 2020 to almost $6.6 billion by May 2021, a growth of about 400% in only one year.Following the announcement of a carefully calibrated position on cryptocurrency and digital money earlier in May, the Finance Ministry stated that the world is evolving quickly with technological advances. The possibility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming recognised as an asset class in India has also been floated recently.On the other hand, the central government has stated that Bitcoin or crypto would not be accepted as legal tender shortly.But there is some good news for the crypto community: the government has stated that it would “investigate the application of crypto’s blockchain technology actively to usher in the digital economy.” Instead of outright outlawing cryptocurrencies, the Indian government may impose stringent rules and regulations in their place.For now, the response to crypto in India has been overwhelmingly positive. It is clear that cryptocurrency does have a market in the country, and it is growing exponentially.The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.

How did it all begin?

NEW DELHI: The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) - the central bank of China - has heeded the advisory sent by its Shenzhen branch to show zero tolerance to cryptocurrencies.Following the advisory, PBOC has taken ‘cleansing’ operations of 11 companies that used to deal with cryptocurrencies in the Shenzhen region, according to a report in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that quoted the state-run Shanghai Securities News.However, the authorities have not divulged finer details of how the issue was dealt with.Shenzhen is a global resource centre for computer hardware that includes cryptocurrency mining equipment.In recent times, this region developed into one of the key bases for China’s digital token investment community, the report adds.As a global economy, China had sensed danger from crypto to its economy and money market following traders going overboard with their passion for the digital currency.The authorities had apprehensions that if allowed to grow, cryptocurrency would be a threat to the financial stability of the country. They had targeted Bitcoin and other digital tokens.In February 2021, Shenzhen shut down eight companies for their alleged activities in digital tokens. The Shenzhen branch of PBOC had cracked down on cross-border trading in foreign currencies and stocks which included cryptocurrencies.The Chinese do not distinguish between foreign currency and cryptocurrency. Both are equal in terms of the damage they cause to their economy. But the Chinese financial experts were okay with foreign exchange earned by trading legal currencies.Shenzhen’s move against cryptocurrency shows the mood of the Chinese administration. It became more evident in the last few months after the State Council’s Financial Stability and Development Committee, chaired by Vice-Premier Liu He, announced a further crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading.Two major operators in China – Huobi, and OKCoin cancelled the business license registration of their respective subsidiaries in Beijing.BTCChina, which once ran the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange is quoted in the report saying that it had “completely exited from bitcoin-related businesses” on the mainland.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85484786,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Buying crypto coins vs buying shares/bonds:

Trading platforms:

Profit controlling factors:

Volatility and market:

Decentralised vs centralised trading:

NEW DELHI: Ever since the advent of cryptocurrency in 2009 in the trading world, it has grown in popularity at an alarming pace.While cryptocurrency continues to intrigue investors, many people often confuse the crypto market with the stock exchange.Here's listing some of the basic differences between the two.In the stock exchange, shares can be bought and traded in two ways.First, the shares and bonds are listed and sold by companies for the first time in the primary market. Then in the secondary market, those shares and bonds are traded with other investors on stock exchange platforms like BSE or NASDAQ. The prospects of returns and risks are determined by the investment method opted by the investor.In cryptocurrency, trading is done by buying and selling of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum with INR, dollars, pound etc. A crypto asset is firstly bought with local currency and crypto investors directly start exploring and trading for earning profits.The stock exchange market of India has 8 established exchange platforms. Among these, NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) account for maximum trading in the country. In case of cryptocurrency, there are online trading platforms like ZebPay that are rapidly growing and gaining a foothold in India’s nascent crypto market.Both stock exchange and crypto markets are controlled by demand and supply factors created by sellers and buyers. The stock market is additionally affected by a host of factors like political events, natural disasters, sporting events etc. This is due to the interdependence of the banking system and government regulations that regulate the stock market.Crypto exchange is an excitingly lucrative trading option, fraught with risks owing to its budding market. This makes crypto extremely volatile and consequently a source of quick and high returns. In comparison, the stock market is a highly stable, established, and diverse trade market where investment returns are relatively easier to trace and predict.Due to the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies, its operations and transactions can’t be controlled or accessed by the central bank, authorities or manipulated by intermediaries. This decentralization provides great transparency and control to crypto users. However, profits earned by trading assets in crypto are also subject to capital gains tax under the Income Tax act.The stock exchange market in India however works under the centralized regulation of the Reserve Bank Of India (RBI) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to curb mismanagement and prevent fraud.Last but not the least, due to the online mode of operation and absence of strong controls cryptocurrency trading is available 24×7 making it easier and accessible. The stock exchange market has limited access because of strict timings and few extended hours of operation.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85484589,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-18170,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,NDTV.com,Hackers Steal $97 Million From Japan Crypto Exchange In 2nd Major Heist,https://www.ndtv.com/business/hackers-steal-97-million-from-japanese-cryptocurrency-exchange-liquid-2514915,"Liquid said it had suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals while it assesses the impact of the attac

Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid was scrambling Friday to recover stolen assets worth nearly $100 million, in the second such major heist by hackers in recent days. The Tokyo-based company said in a statement Thursday that it had ""detected unauthorized access of some of the crypto wallets managed at Liquid"".

Elliptic, a London-based firm which helps track stolen cryptocurrencies, said its analysis found ""just over $97 million in cryptoassets have been received by the accounts identified by Liquid as belonging to the thief"".

""Our investigators are also aiding Liquid with tracking the stolen funds,"" Elliptic added in a blog post.

The heist comes after a hacker stole assets worth $600 million last week from cryptocurrency trading company Poly Network, before gradually giving the money back, claiming they had pulled off the theft to highlight a security flaw.

Liquid said it had suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals while it assesses the impact of the attack, although trading was continuing.

Cryptocurrencies have soared in popularity as assets in recent years, despite their volatility and concerns over their environmental impact as trading them requires vast quantities of electricity.

Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies use a technology called blockchain, which ensures that every transaction is recorded.

Thieves trying to steal cryptocurrencies typically move the funds through many different accounts at dizzying speed -- sometimes hundreds of thousands of transactions -- in an attempt to cover their tracks.

However, industry players have grown better at identifying and blocking stolen coins. Liquid said $16.3 million worth of stolen Ethereum had already been frozen ""due to the assistance of the crypto community and other exchanges"".","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/2r1h0gng_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none

Here's What To Know

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images

For many people, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are part of an exciting and lucrative new financial frontier. But for the country's top market watchdog, Gary Gensler, they seem ""like the Wild West"" – and he's promising a crackdown.

The market for cryptocurrencies has ballooned. It is currently estimated to be worth about $2 trillion, thanks to the exploding popularity of Bitcoin and other virtual money like Dogecoin.

Amateur investors, particularly younger ones, have started buying and trading cryptocurrencies, attracted to the thrill of big returns. In the past year, the value of Bitcoin has risen 300%. And cryptocurrencies are increasingly also attractive to traditional investors.

But the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, and even as it becomes more mainstream, it continues to be popular among bad actors.

In recent months, hackers have demanded ransomware payments in Bitcoin, because it is easy to transfer and hard to trace. And there have been plenty of reports of thefts and heists at cryptocurrency exchanges in which cybercriminals have absconded with other people's virtual holdings.

In a recent speech, Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), denounced the lack of transparency and clear regulations, and promised the commission will take action to protect investors, which is a key part of the agency's mission.

""Investors really aren't getting the information to judge the risk, and understand the risk,"" Gensler said. ""If we don't address the issues, I worry a lot of people will get hurt.""

The process is still at the very beginning, but here's what to know.

So, who's Gensler?

Gensler is an experienced regulator, who has worked on Capitol Hill and in the Treasury Department. When he ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration, he played a key role writing and implementing new rules that apply to a segment of the market called derivatives.

Gensler also knows a lot about cryptocurrencies. Most recently, he was a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he focused ""on blockchain technology, digital currencies, financial technology, and public policy."" (One of his courses is available for free online.)

How are cryptocurrencies regulated right now?

The market has developed so fast, regulations haven't kept up. So policymakers have talked about reining in cryptocurrencies under a new regulatory framework for years. But so far, that hasn't happened.

That leaves millions of people who trade cryptocurrencies and assets related to them without clearly defined rules of trading.

It has also complicated life for professional investors and companies that do business with cryptocurrencies. Tiffany J. Smith, a partner at the law firm WilmerHale, who runs a cryptocurrency regulatory practice, helps her clients mitigate risk.

""In the absence of, you know, definitive regulation that applies to crypto assets, we work with them to craft policies, procedures, and processes,"" she says.

So what to expect first?

Clearer definitions is one of the most pressing issues.

Because cryptocurrencies are relatively new, there are not even universally agreed-upon definitions for some of the most basic terms. Can assets being traded on cryptocurrency exchanges be called securities, or are they something completely different? Is Bitcoin a commodity?

This goes beyond semantics; It can determine which regulator has the authority to regulate cryptocurrencies and related assets.

New York University Law School Professor Robert J. Jackson Jr., who used to be an SEC commissioner, says clarity is incredibly important.

""It's past time for regulators to be clear about who is responsible for this, and that clarity will be beneficial to the market,"" he says. ""It will be beneficial to investors. It will even be beneficial to those members of Congress and the other public policymakers who want to know whom to ask, and who to hold accountable for what is going on in those markets.""

What else can we also expect earlier on?

Determining jurisdiction will be critical as well.

So far, the SEC and the CFTC have shared regulatory responsibilities. They have tried to police cryptocurrencies with laws that are already on the books, even though they were really written for other traditional kinds of assets like stocks or bonds.

Smith expects this is likely to continue until there are new, cryptocurrency-specific regulations, meaning regulators will continue to adapt current frameworks for the virtual currency market.

""We are going to see both the SEC and the CFTC using their current authorities to regulate the market as best they can,"" says Smith.

But Gensler has called on Congress to give regulators the authority to write new rules.

He also wants more resources — more money and manpower — to regulate cryptocurrencies. For years, leaders of the SEC and the CFTC have complained that Congress hasn't given them enough money for them to their jobs.

Are there any specific actions expected?

There will be new proposed regulations for sure; It's just not clear in what form.

Gensler has not tipped his hand, and he did not spell out specific actions the SEC might be contemplating during his speech.

But in his speech, Gensler called for the need of ""guardrails,"" or actions intended to protect individual investors, for cryptocurrencies.

So the SEC is likely to take a closer look at aspects like the potential for market manipulation, determining basic rights for amateur investors and bringing in more transparency.

Congress is also proposing new rules. The Senate tucked in a provision to toughen tax enforcement on cryptocurrency players in its recent infrastructure bill, though the final fate remains uncertain given that the House has yet to weigh in.

How does the industry approach regulation?

So far, professional investors say they would actually welcome new regulations – as long as they are not too stringent.

Robert Jackson, the former S.E.C. commissioner, argues regulation will widen the appeal of cryptocurrency assets.

""The market will be better off, because assuring investors that they are getting the kind of transparent pricing they are used to in American markets will encourage other investors to consider the possibility of investing in cryptocurrency,"" he says.

But rules perceived as too stringent will inevitably spark fights. Lobbyists for the cryptocurrency industry tried to fight off Senate rules, calling the tax crackdown too broad.

How will new regulations change cryptocurrencies?

This is a fascinating existential question. Cryptocurrencies were borne of this iconoclastic desire for there to be assets untethered from governments and central banks. No one is really sure what will happen to it when that structure changes.

But many believe new regulations could help cryptocurrencies become a bigger part of our daily lives. For example, some companies, including AMC Theaters, have already announced they will accept cryptocurrencies as payment.","('https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/08/19/gettyimages-1234060979_wide-80455078d37f22a33cb4bc0ced8be44539c83d7b.jpg?s=1400',)",none

While the broader cryptocurrency market took a breather, Cardano's ada extended a stunning weeks-long rally early Friday morning, soaring 10% in a matter of hours as trading volume in the token, which last week became the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, swelled amid anticipation for a coming software upgrade that could help it compete with Ethereum.

Now the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, Cardano's ada has skyrocketed 1,300% this year. getty

Key Facts

Cardano's ada jumped more than 14% to a price of $2.49 by 12:52 a.m. EDT Friday, its highest point since a record of $2.46 on May 16, according to crypto data website CoinMarketCap, and taking its market capitalization above $75 billion. Reflecting investors' Thursday fervor, as of 11:00 p.m. EDT, more than $8 billion worth of ada tokens had traded hands in 24 hours—the highest one-day showing since a May price surge. The token has been on a steady tear this month, soaring 85% as Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson teased a September network upgrade, named Alonzo, that will enable the Cardano blockchain to process smart contracts, self-executing agreements between buyers and sellers that have helped Ethereum dominate the booming $100 billion decentralized finance industry. Prospects of a software upgrade have also boosted Ethereum to three-month highs in recent weeks, but Cardano's newer network, which still trails in adoption, has drawn skeptics like former billionaire hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz. In a tweet after ada became the world's third-largest cryptocurrency this month, Novogratz, a staunch bitcoin bull, said the token's rise was ""a mystery"" to him and suggested its platform was struggling to gain traction among software developers who build the programs necessary for a cryptocurrency's adoption. Hoskinson, who also cofounded Ethereum, hit back at the financier, responding to a tweet touting that Cardano requires less energy than Ethereum to process transactions and mocking Novogratz's background in the traditional banking space.

Key Background

Cardano's ada skyrocketed in May after billionaire Elon Musk soured on bitcoin and said Tesla would no longer accept the cryptocurrency due to the hefty environmental downside of the massive amounts of electricity used to “mine” new coins. The crypto market crashed and has yet to fully recover, but ada surged to new highs as investors flocked to more environmentally sustainable tokens. Hoskinson has claimed Cardano uses just 6 gigawatt hours of energy annually—not even 0.01% of the 115.85 terawatt hours bitcoin is estimated to use. The token plunged nearly 60% as the broader market collapsed this summer but has since started to outperform bitcoin and ether.

Surprising Fact

Ada has skyrocketed 1,300% this year alone, making it the best-performing top five cryptocurrency compared to returns of 1,030% for binance coin, 330% for ether and 59% for bitcoin. However, the token is also highly susceptible to the broader crypto market’s massive volatility. Ada crashed nearly 90% within less than two months in early 2018 as regulatory crypto crackdowns ushered in a years-long bear market for the nascent industry.

Tangent

Amid Cardano's late-night rally, the broader cryptocurrency market climbed less than 4% and floated around a total value of $2 trillion. The market soared above $2.5 trillion in May but plummeted amid concerns over regulations banning cryptocurrency mining in China.

The bitcoin price remains off the closely-watched $50,000 per bitcoin level but ethereum has climbed back over the $3,000 mark after dipping under it earlier today.

Now, as cardano and solana make double-digit gains and outpace other cryptocurrencies, famed investment strategist Lyn Alden has predicted bitcoin will hit $100,000 and ethereum will reach $5,000 as soon as next year.

""I think we're still in kind of the early-to-mid stage of its long-term trajectory,"" Alden, who founded Lyn Alden Investment Strategy in 2016, told Insider in an interview. ""So that remains, I think, the best risk-reward as kind of a set-it-and-forget-it allocation.""

Alden believes bitcoin had a good chance of topping $100,000 at some point before the end of 2022 while a supply squeeze caused by a recent ethereum upgrade is ""tactically bullish"" and could send the ethereum price soaring to over $5,000.

The combined cryptocurrency market has recently returned to over $2 trillion, fueling many bullish bitcoin and ethereum predictions.

Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone has also said bitcoin could soon hit $100,000 while Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, thinks bitcoin is due a surge higher and will rally strongly through the second half of 2021.

The latest crypto rally has seen two rivals to ethereum's blockchain, cardano and solana, more than double in the last month alone.

The bitcoin price has added almost 300% over the last year though other smaller cryptocurrencies, ... [+] including ethereum, cardano, and solana, have made even bigger gains. Coinbase

""I think solana is a well-designed ethereum competitor,"" Alden said. ""Its main risk is that it's newer. It doesn't really have a significant network effect yet. And so it hasn't really reached a critical mass, but it is well-designed.""

Solana has close links with the rapidly growing FTX crypto exchange—FTX's sister company Alameda Research is an investor in solana, and FTX also operates its own decentralized exchange called Serum on the solana blockchain.

Cardano, now the third-biggest cryptocurrency by value after bitcoin and ethereum with a total value of $75 billion, has surged 30% during the last week as investors eye a much-anticipated upgrade that's due to be released on September 12. The completed upgrade will enable the cardano blockchain to support smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

""The upgrade will help cardano to match ethereum's capabilities,"" Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at Vienna-based brokerage Bitpanda, wrote in an emailed note.

Alden is less confident when it comes to cardano, however.

""We have to see what happens with cardano,"" Alden said. ""They have a lot of pipe, but they've had pretty slow development, so I tend to prefer solana over cardano.""","('https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5f7507b84b042f0a1785c377%2F0x0.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,Second-largest U.S. mortgage lender will accept payment in bitcoin,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/united-wholesale-mortgage-will-accept-bitcoin-other-cryptocurrency.html,"""We've evaluated the feasibility, and we're looking forward to being the first mortgage company in America to accept cryptocurrency to satisfy mortgage payments,"" CEO Mat Ishbia said in the company's second quarter earnings call on Monday.

United Wholesale Mortgage , which made its public debut in January via a special purpose acquisition (SPAC) merger, announced plans this week to accept cryptocurrency for home loans, in what is being billed as a first for the national mortgage industry.

Starting later this year, U.S. homebuyers will have the option to pay for their mortgage in bitcoin .

""That's something that we've been working on, and we're excited that hopefully, in Q3, we can actually execute on that before anyone in the country because we are a leader in technology and innovation.""

The Michigan-based mortgage company confirmed to CNBC that it's aiming to start by accepting bitcoin, though UWM is in the process of evaluating ether and other cryptocurrencies as well.

""We are evaluating the feasibility and requirements in order to accept cryptocurrency to satisfy mortgage payments,"" said Ishbia in a tweet via the company's account.

UWM – the nation's second-biggest mortgage lender after Quicken, the Detroit-based lending giant owned by Rocket Companies – works solely through wholesale channels, meaning that the company employs a fleet of brokers who then connect clients to home loans.

The push into decentralized digital money comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of crypto from all sides in the U.S.

Revamped crypto tax rules are a part of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, and financial authorities like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and Fed Chief Jerome Powell have all spoken recently on the topic of whether to regulate cryptocurrency.

It is unclear is whether UWM will hold the cryptocurrency it accepts or convert it to fiat at the point of transaction. The company did not immediately get back to CNBC with that information.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106758801-1603459526384-picture-perfect-beautiful-house-on-the-island-of-coronado-in-sunny-california-beautifully-landscaped_t20_6lJOrv.jpg?v=1603459593',)",none
2021-08-23,Yahoo Finance,Facebook pushes ahead with crypto wallet plan in bid to 'fix broken payment system',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-presses-ahead-with-crypto-initiative-in-bold-move-to-fix-broken-payment-system-203559834.html,"Facebook (FB) is plowing ahead with plans to shake up the cryptocurrency-based payment system, even as the company contends with new accusations by the federal government that it is abusing its market power.

On Wednesday, David Marcus, the Facebook guru spearheading its crypto efforts, unveiled new details about Novi, the digital wallet side of the initiative he called a “challenger in the payment industry.”

In a lengthy post on Medium, Marcus revealed that Novi has secured licenses or approvals in nearly every state. It will offer free peer-to-peer payments “domestically and internationally” and earn profits from “merchant services” similar to other crypto wallets.

Marcus' post came a day before the Federal Trade Commission refiled a claim that accused Facebook of running an illegal ""buy or bury"" scheme. Amid widespread concerns surrounding the company's business practices, it's unclear whether the FTC's action could impact Facebook's ambitions in the blockchain sector.

Formerly known as Libra, Diem is the cryptocurrency and blockchain-based payment system Facebook first announced in June 2019. After facing major backlash from global regulators and industry players, the tech giant dramatically scaled back its plans and rebranded the project as ""Diem.""

Yet unlike Bitcoin (BTC-USD)and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), Diem will run on a permissioned-blockchain. Instead of using governance models such as Bitcoin’s proof-of-work or Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake mechanism, which rely on mining cryptocurrency, Diem proposes to use the Switzerland-based Diem Association to process transactions.

The cadre of private companies encountered trouble after losing many of the association’s starting members such as PayPal (PYPL), Mastercard (MA), Ebay (EBAY) and Visa (V), just months after the project’s initial 2019 announcement. Regulatory concern over consumer privacy and potential antitrust risks have further slowed the project's launch.

Story continues

In May, Diem announced a partnership with Silvergate Capital Corporation (SI), a bank holding company whose subsidiary, Silvergate Bank, provides banking for companies in the crypto space. The partnership stated Silvergate would become the exclusive issuer of the Diem stablecoin, which will have its value pegged to the U.S. dollar. However, some analysts think Facebook's creation will face more regulatory roadblocks.

David Marcus, CEO of Facebook’s Calibra, testifies to the House Financial Services Committee hearing on ""Examining Facebook's Proposed Cryptocurrency and Its Impact on Consumers, Investors, and the American Financial System"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., July 17, 2019. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

A good stablecoin is hard to find

According to Marcus, the current payment infrastructure in the U.S. has remained ""broken,"" and in need of fixing. To service the 62 million Americans and 1.7 billion people worldwide who are still without a bank account, America needs to step up, he declared.

And the executive stated that stablecoins like Diem should at least be given a “fair shot” in providing the answer.

Basically cryptocurrencies backed by governments, other fiat currencies or even exchange-traded commodities, stablecoins have little to no price volatility when compared to unpegged cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

And thanks to lower volatility, stablecoins arguably provide a better medium of exchange than other cryptocurrencies. China’s digital yuan, a government-backed cryptocurrency developed by the country’s central bank, has already been deployed in real-world trials since early 2021.

“Contrary to many points of view, stablecoins with strong control at the network and wallet levels unlock enormous opportunities to innovate in this area,” wrote Marcus. Along with 1 to 1 reserves, a “well-designed stablecoin offers better consumer protections than a fiat balance held in any wallet available in the US right now.”

The topic of stablecoins has gotten hotter in finance, and with good reason. With a market capitalization of $64 billion, Tether (USDT-USD), the largest stablecoin, has been criticized for not providing audits of its reserves.

Marcus also argued that “well-designed stablecoins and their ecosystem of wallets” have the potential to improve traditional controls for “anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing sanctions and tax compliance.” In short, they can make the financial system more transparent, increase consumer protection and curb dark money floating around the system.

The argument for Diem has gotten a slight boost from El Salvador, which in June announced plans to make Bitcoin legal tender in the country. While Bitcoin is not a stablecoin, its proposed use in El Salvador overlaps with some of the possible benefits and risks associated with stablecoins such as financial inclusion, transparency and legality.

One main goal with the Salvadoran law is to lower the cost of cross-border remittances, which make up 20 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Currently, it proposes to do this by using Bitcoin’s lightning network, a payment protocol on top of Bitcoin that makes transactions faster, cheaper and more private.

Gabor Gurbacs, Director of Digital Assets Strategy at the global investment manager, VanEck, thinks that given the right approach, the Facebook initiative will work.

“Facebook has roughly 2.9 billion users. Their efforts and trajectory in digitization may become one of the most important social media developments for the western hemisphere. I hope regulators allow technology companies to innovate,” Gurbacs said.

One model for how this could work might be found in the digital company, Square, which owns the mobile payment service Cash App.

2021-08-23,Moneycontrol,"Selecting the best Altcoins, the Gulzar way!",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/selecting-the-best-altcoins-the-gulzar-way-7363171.html,"If an altcoin is trading at extremely low levels, it's best to stay away from it, since trading volumes are a direct representation of the market sentiment and investor confidence in the potential of the coin.

Altcoins or digital tokens other than market leaders Bitcoin and ethereum are in rage these days, as investors seek to diversify their cryptocurrency allocations and venture into new waters. And while this might be a fleeting, and almost touch-and-go phase the world witnesses, there’s no denying that there is a certain evergreen-ish quality about some things, be it stock fundamentals, books, movies, or movies more likely and importantly, music.

Old Hindi melodies, just like timeless investment advice, weather the test of time and relevance very successfully. And when it comes to penning down these heartfelt songs, from Tere Bina Zindagi se Shikwa nahi to Musafir hu yaaron to Satrangi re, it's hard to dismiss the classical significance of Gulzar and his words, which, almost compulsorily form a part of almost all our nostalgic and memorable family evenings, reunions, intimate gatherings and more.

Somehow, his words never seem to lose pertinence and expression, even after 87 years of age, a landmark he celebrated just yesterday. But how does one master the art of effortlessly merging the new and old, the traditional and modern, something as dynamic and nascent as the cryptocurrency market and something as profound as this legend’s lyrics?

His songs, over the years, have held many, many life lessons, and rewinding my Gulzar playlist, I could not help but look out for such gems to properly identify rewarding altcoins in his never-ending list of tracks. Take a look :

Jinke sar ho research ki chaanv, portfolio main achche altcoins honge

Jinke Sar Ho Ishq Ki Chaaon





Paanv Ke Neeche Jannat Hogi

Jinke Sar Ho Ishq Ki Chaaon

There’s hardly anyone who hasn't grooved to this iconic song and re-enacted SRK’s amazing moves atop the train, making its way amidst the rainy mountains. While this song might make you break into impromptu jigs and rightly so, that is certainly not advisable while choosing the altcoins for your portfolio.



Management quality, as opposed to celebrities endorsing the coin



The underlying technology and its potential applications



Social media frenzy versus actual progress



Market capitalisation



Vision and purpose.



Research, research, and research before you deep dive into the uncharted, novel territories of altcoins, including:

For this, you can glance over the whitepaper of the currency. As Edul Patel, C0-founder and CEO, Mudrex, explains, “whitepapers provide key information such as practical use cases, scalability, future roadmap, community engagement and growth prospects”.

Look out for launch dates and steer clear of altcoins which are clearly riding on the back of a bullish cycle and do not have any fundamentals backing them once the run ends and the hype dies down.

Thoda Hai Thode Ki Zaroorat Hai, portfolio main zyada risks lene ki kya zaroorat hai?

Thoda hai Thode



Ki Zaroorat hai





Zindagi Phir Bhi



Yahan Khoobsurat Hai





Thoda Hai Thode

Ki Zaroorat Hai

Kishore Kumar serenades this eternally soulful song to perhaps explain the many shortcomings of greed, which is generally followed by an unbalanced appetite for high risks. Agreed, many altcoins have been booming, recording good growth figures over the last week, like Solana (82.42 percent), Polkadot (26.97 percent), Cardano (27.63 percent), and more. But, why choose erratic growth spurts over consistent progress?

Just like you balance your asset allocation between risky and stable investments, make sure the altcoins in your portfolio do not exceed a certain threshold, lest the novelty and extreme volatility of the coin might adversely affect your returns. Again, steer away from altcoins not available on regulated exchanges.

Per Anant Deshpande, Co-founder at FinBox, credit underwriting expert, and crypto enthusiast, Invest only your surplus, since it's a “frenzied speculative market, Investors must not put all their hard-earned money in these super-risky asset classes. Prefer going mainstream within the alternative, as well.”

This also means sticking to your basics, like preferring altcoins with a larger investor base and market capitalisation, among others. One way to go about it is to set parameters for your altcoin basket, like choosing from amongst the top 30 altcoins only, or restricting your investments to coins with a minimum market capitalisation worth 5 million dollars, etc.

As Patel further elaborates, “ An Altcoin having a market cap of $50 million, might not grow 10x as fast as an Altcoin with a $2 million market cap. So, for investors who would want higher returns might look at coins with a lower market cap, but within some defined limits”.





Ishq par zor nahin hai yeh woh aatish ghalib



Jo lagaye na lage aur bujhaye na bane

Ishq par zor nahin hai yeh woh aatish Ghalib

Markets are, indeed, as volatile and eruptive as Gulzar Sahab describes Ishq to be. And in a space where fortunes are built and demolished overnight, one needs to be especially careful of tracking the daily activities of these altcoins. If the 24-hour trading volume is sustainable, and remains at 50 percent of its market capitalisation, along with traded volumes stay buoyant at 10 percent, it indicates that the coin is liquid, allowing you easy sell-offs in case of a crash.

If an altcoin is trading at extremely low levels, it's best to stay away from it, since trading volumes are a direct representation of the market sentiment and investor confidence in the potential of the coin.

2021 has been a big year for cryptocurrency. But what’s next?

We’ve seen Bitcoin hit a new all-time high price, regulatory talks with potential to have big impact on the industry, and more institutional buy-in from major companies. All the while, people’s interest in crypto has skyrocketed this year: it’s a hot topic not only among investors but in popular culture too, thanks to everyone from long-standing investors like Elon Musk to that kid from your high school on Facebook.

In many ways, the first half of 2021 has been a “breakthrough,” says Dave Abner, head of global development at Gemini, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. “There’s tremendous focus and attention being paid to [the crypto industry].”

RELATED: Top Crypto News This Week

But the industry is only in its infancy and constantly evolving. It’s difficult to predict where things are headed long-term, but in the coming months, experts are following themes from regulation to institutional adoption of crypto payments to try and get a better sense of the market.

While exact predictions are impossible, we asked five experts about what they’re paying attention to in the crypto space for the rest of 2021:

Cryptocurrency Regulation

Expect continued conversations about cryptocurrency regulation. Lawmakers in Washington D.C. and across the world are trying to figure out how to establish laws and guidelines to make cryptocurrency safer for investors and less appealing to cybercriminals.

China reaffirmed its efforts to crack down on digital currencies this year, primarily through crypto mining regulations, while U.S. Senators have considered new regulation to bolster cryptocurrency tax reporting measures.

“Regulation is probably one of the biggest overhangs in the crypto industry globally,” says Jeffrey Wang, head of the Americas at Amber Group, a Canada-based crypto finance firm. “We would very much welcome clear regulation.”

Like most things with cryptocurrency, regulation comes with hurdles. “There are different agencies that may or may not have jurisdiction to oversee everything,” says Wang. “And it differs state by state.”

Both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have expressed their agencies’ interests in regulation, while Security and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has commented on both his own agency’s and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s role in policing the industry. Plus, the IRS has an obvious interest in making sure investors know how to report virtual currency when they file their taxes.

Clear regulation would mean the removal of a “significant roadblock for cryptocurrency,” says Wang, since U.S. firms and investors are operating without clear guidelines at the moment.

What new regulation could mean for investors

Recent proposed legislation could make it easier for the IRS to find cases of tax evasion when it comes to crypto, though investors should already keep records of any capital gains or losses on their crypto assets. But the new rules may also make it easier for investors to properly report crypto transactions.

“This is because if the bill passes, exchanges will have to issue 1099-B tax forms with cost basis information to investors,” Shehan Chandrasekera, CPA, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker.io, a crypto tax software company, recently told NextAdvisor. “This will significantly reduce the crypto tax filing burden.”

Regulatory announcements can also affect the price of cryptocurrency in already volatile markets. Market volatility is why investing experts recommend keeping any cryptocurrency investments to less than 5% of your total portfolio and never invest anything you’re not OK with losing.

Ultimately, many experts believe regulation is a good thing for the industry. “Sensible regulation is a win for everyone,” says Ben Weiss, CEO and cofounder of CoinFlip, a cryptocurrency buying platform and crypto ATM network. “It gives people more confidence in crypto, but I think it’s something we have to take our time on and we have to get it right.”

Possible Crypto ETF Approval

SEC Chairman Gensler recently hinted that investors may soon have access to a cryptocurrency ETF, which would represent a new and more conventional way to invest in crypto. A cryptocurrency ETF would allow investors to buy cryptocurrency directly from traditional investment brokerages they may already have accounts with, like Fidelity or Vanguard.

“We do it in the equity market, we do it in the bond markets, people might want it here,” Gensler said at the Aspen Security Forum earlier this month, while also acknowledging there have already been filings for crypto ETFs with his agency.

ETF approval has been in consideration by the SEC multiple times over the past few years, but none have yet been greenlighted as in other regions, like Canada and the EU.

“I was anticipating that approval would happen before the end of 2021. I’m still hopeful for that,” says Abner. “There’s obviously a lot of people looking at it with the other regulation that is being introduced. That could potentially slow things down, but I think there’s still a possibility you could see some approval, either at the end of this year, or at least early in 2022.”

What a crypto ETF would mean for investors

Crypto ETFs are not yet available in the U.S., but approval could mean more Americans buying in and influencing the crypto market. Instead of learning to navigate a cryptocurrency exchange to trade your digital assets, you could add crypto to your portfolio directly from the same brokerage with which you already have a retirement or other traditional investment account.

However, investing in a crypto ETF would still carry the same risk as any crypto investment — it’s a portfolio of assets, but would be diversified only by different cryptocurrencies, which are all speculative and volatile. If you’re not willing to lose the money you put into crypto by purchasing on an exchange or an eventual crypto fund, you should carefully consider if you’re willing to take on the risk of having cryptocurrency in your portfolio at all.

Broader Institutional Cryptocurrency Adoption

Mainstream companies across industries have taken interest — and in some cases themselves invested in — cryptocurrency and blockchain in 2021. AMC, for example, recently announced it will be able to accept Bitcoin payments by the end of this year. Fintech companies like PayPal and Square are also betting on crypto by allowing users to buy on their platforms. Tesla continues to go back and forth on its acceptance of Bitcoin payments, though the company holds billions in crypto assets. Experts predict more and more of this buy-in.

“We’ve seen a tremendous amount of inflow of attention, and that’s going to continue to drive the growth of the industry for a while now,” says Abner.

Some experts predict bigger, global corporations could jumpstart this adoption even more in the latter half of this year. “What we’re looking at is institutions getting involved in crypto, whether it’s Amazon or the big banks,” says Weiss. A huge retailer like Amazon could “create a chain reaction of others accepting it,” and would “add a lot of credibility.”

Indeed, Amazon has recently sparked rumors that it’s making moves to that end by sharing a job posting for a “digital currency and blockchain product lead.” Walmart is also recruiting a crypto expert to oversee its blockchain strategy.

What more institutional adoption means for investors

While paying for things in cryptocurrencies doesn’t make sense for most people right now, more retailers accepting payments might change that landscape in the future. It’ll likely be much longer before it’ll be a smart financial decision to spend Bitcoin on goods or services, but further institutional adoption could bring about more use-cases for everyday users, and in turn, have an impact on crypto prices. Nothing is guaranteed, but if you buy cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value, the more “real world” uses it has, the more likely demand and value will increase.

Bitcoin’s Future Outlook

Bitcoin is a good indicator of the crypto market in general, because it’s the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and the rest of the market tends to follow its trends.

Bitcoin’s price has taken a wild ride so far in 2021, from a high point of $60,000 in April to less than $30,000 as recently as July. More recently, Bitcoin has climbed back toward $50,000. This volatility is a big part of why experts recommend keeping your crypto investments to less than 5% of your portfolio to begin with.

But how high will Bitcoin go? Bitcoin’s past may provide some clues, according to Kiana Danial, author of “Cryptocurrency Investing for Dummies.”

Danial says there have been plenty of huge spikes followed by pullbacks in Bitcoin’s price since 2011. “What I expect from Bitcoin is volatility short-term and growth long-term.”

Others are more bullish on Bitcoin’s short-term growth.

Bill Noble, chief technical analyst at TokenMetrics, a cryptocurrency analytics platform, thinks the price of Bitcoin will climb throughout the rest of the year. “I think it’s more likely Bitcoin goes to $75,000 than $25,000,” he says.

What Bitcoin price volatility means for investors

Bitcoin’s volatility is more reason for investors to play a steady long game. If you’re buying for long-term growth potential, then don’t worry about short-term swings. The best thing you can do is not look at your cryptocurrency investment, or “set it and forget it.” As experts continue to tell us each time there’s a price swing — whether up or down — emotional reaction can cause investors to act rashly and make decisions that result in losses on their investment.

The Future of Cryptocurrency

We can speculate on what value cryptocurrency may have for investors in the coming months and years (and many will), but the reality is it’s still a new and speculative investment, without much history on which to base predictions. No matter what a given expert thinks or says, no one really knows. That’s why it’s important to only invest what you’re prepared to lose, and stick to more conventional investments for long-term wealth building.

“If you were to wake one morning to find that crypto has been banned by the developed nations and it became worthless, would you be OK?” Frederick Stanield, a CFP with Lifewater Wealth Management in Atlanta, Georgia, told NextAdvisor recently.

Keep your investments small, and never put crypto investments above any other financial goals like saving for retirement and paying off high interest debt.","('https://time.com/nextadvisor/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/na-the-future-of-crypto-1000x630.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,The New York Times,The World’s Biggest Crypto Exchange Still Lacks U.S. Footing,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/business/binance-cryptocurrency-exchange-ipo.html,"The quest for legitimacy in the United States is leading Binance.com, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to pursue an initial public offering of its American unit. But for a company founded on secrecy — as cryptocurrency firms typically are — the going could be slow and fitful.

This month, Brian Brooks, the chief executive of Binance.US, left the company after just three months on the job, citing “strategic differences.” Changpeng Zhao, the Chinese Canadian billionaire who owns Binance.com, had hired Mr. Brooks, a former regulator, to help the company gain a U.S. footing. Mr. Brooks left after a venture capital investment he was trying to put together for Binance.US fell through. The deal would have been the first step to a potential I.P.O., but some investors balked at the amount of control Mr. Zhao would retain over Binance.US.

Companies that deal in digital money are trying to grow up. Often started by lone programmers lugging laptops across the globe, many cryptocurrency firms are restructuring themselves into more traditional entities that have boards of directors and audited financial reports. Some are gunning for a bigger presence in the United States, a lucrative market where hordes of customers are already flocking to their platforms — just as wary regulators have started paying close attention.

In a recent speech, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, referred to the space as “the Wild West.”","('https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/18/business/00Binance-01/00Binance-01-facebookJumbo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,More than $90 million in cryptocurrency stolen after a top Japanese exchange is hacked,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/liquid-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack.html,"Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid said Thursday it has been hit by a cyberattack that saw hackers make off with a reported $97 million worth of digital coins.

Liquid said some of its digital currency wallets had been ""compromised,"" and that hackers were transferring the assets to four different wallets.

""We are currently investigating and will provide regular updates,"" Liquid tweeted. ""In the meantime deposits and withdrawals will be suspended.""

Liquid did not provide an estimate for the loss. It says it is regulated by Japan's Financial Services Agency. The watchdog was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

Elliptic, a blockchain analytics company, said its analysis showed that about $97 million in cryptocurrencies have been obtained by the hackers.

Of the total haul, $45 million in tokens were being converted to ethereum through decentralized exchanges — blockchain-based platforms that require no intermediaries — like Uniswap and SushiSwap, Elliptic said.

""This enables the hacker to avoid having these assets frozen — as is possible with many Ethereum tokens,"" Elliptic said in a blog post.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106930253-1629367715182-gettyimages-1234739851-porzycki-internet210817_npTeY.jpeg?v=1629368128',)",none

DeVere Group CEO Nigel Green also believes that Ether’s value will have exceeded Bitcoin’s within a few short years.

“Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, and it can be expected to continue this trend for the rest of 2021,” he said.

Ether has gained more than 300% so far this year, whereas the world’s most popular digital asset is up 55% by comparison. “In fact, it has outperformed all other benchmark assets in the first half of this year,” added Green, according to City AM.

The respected analyst attributed two key factors to Ether’s stellar performance in 2021. Ether has a higher level of real-use potential and is the most in-demand development platform for smart contracts, he said, “thereby highlighting that network’s value not only as a platform for developers but as a worldwide financial utility.”

Secondly, Green commented that investor enthusiasm for the “game-changing” transition to Ethereum 2.0 represents a major boost not just for Ether but for blockchain technology itself.

“Ultimately, this will mean that its value will exceed that of Bitcoin — probably within five years”

The company executive isn’t bearish on Bitcoin (BTC), however, and remains confident that Bitcoin will have hit, or even have surpassed, its mid-April all-time high of $65,000 by the end of 2021. However, Green concluded that:

“Ethereum’s ascent to the top of the cryptoverse seems unstoppable.”

In early June, deVere launched a fixed-yield bond that tracks futures of Bitcoin and Ether on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

According to United Kingdom crypto exchange CoinJar, Ether has flipped Bitcoin in almost every metric that matters. In a blog post on Wednesday, the exchange stated that Ether is already surpassing Bitcoin in a number of areas, including the number of transactions, total value transacted, daily active wallets, transaction fees and mining revenue.

According to Coinbase’s second-quarter report, Ether’s trading volume has flipped Bitcoin’s for the first time in its nine-year history.

Trading in ETH made up 26% of total volumes in the second quarter, up from 21% in the previous three months, and higher than Bitcoin’s 24% for the period.","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDgvYzZkNzgwZTYtODBmYi00NmJkLThhNzktYjhmMjhhZDJjOWEwLmpwZw==.jpg',)",none

ETH.CM=

When Canadian cryptocurrency trader Fawaz Ahmed saw the price of ethereum dropping, he knew it was time to get out. Unfortunately for him, he couldn't. Ahmed was trading on Binance, the world's largest digital currency exchange by trading volume. And on May 19, Binance experienced a major outage which meant that, for about an hour, he was unable to exit his position. That day, bitcoin and ethereum posted their biggest one-day drops since March 2020, with the entire crypto market losing roughly $1 trillion in value. When prices fell below a certain point, Ahmed's position got wiped out. His personal losses came to about $6 million. ""This loss was not fair,"" Ahmed, a 33-year-old who trades full-time, told CNBC. ""This is something which was out of my control."" Binance's customer service team gave Ahmed an ""absurdly"" low offer of compensation, he said. Ahmed is one of hundreds of investors expected to take part in arbitration proceedings against Binance, seeking damages for the money they lost when the cryptocurrency exchange went offline. Binance said it was unable to comment on ""pending legal matters."" ""Our policy is fair in that we compensate users who experienced actual trading losses due to our system's issues,"" a spokesperson for the firm told CNBC. ""We do not cover hypothetical 'what could have been' situations such as unrealized profits.""

Binance has experienced several outages over the years in times of heightened volatility for virtual currencies. That can be costly for traders, especially when prices are plunging. And those losses can balloon to millions of dollars when investors make risky bets using leverage, or borrowed money, to augment trades — which, on Binance, is something users do often. Binance recently cut the maximum leverage customers can take on futures — financial derivatives that oblige investors to buy an asset at an agreed-upon price at a later date — to 20 times from a previous limit of 125 times. Binance wasn't the only crypto exchange to face disruption to its service on May 19. Coinbase users were also temporarily unable to access its site. Bitcoin plunged as much as 30% to nearly $30,000 that day. It has since recovered to $45,790.

No headquarters

Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, Binance's boss, has previously said the exchange has no official headquarters. That makes it extremely difficult for investors to figure out how, and where, to take the company to court. A group of crypto traders hopes to change that. With the help of Liti Capital, a little-known Swiss private equity firm providing litigation financing, nearly 1,000 people are expected to join arbitration proceedings in Hong Kong to seek damages from Binance. ""This is a landmark case for the industry,"" David Kay, chief investment officer of Liti Capital, told CNBC.

Binance is ""the first company that has ever grown to any size in any industry — much less the financial industry — where there is no regulation,"" he said. ""They have no home, they have no headquarters, they have no office."" ""The only place where Binance has said they have jurisdiction is in a Hong Kong international arbitration court,"" Kay added. ""This will be the largest consumer international arbitration in history."" Kay said that Liti Capital began working on the Binance case after receiving a call from Aija Lejniece, an independent lawyer working with a group of crypto traders in France. Lejniece specializes in international arbitration cases. Binance's terms of use say that any legal dispute must be resolved through arbitration at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre. Arbitration proceedings, unlike class action lawsuits, aim to settle disputes out of court. The format makes it harder for the average consumer to make a claim, Kay said, as claimants have to pay arbitration fees and additional costs — for instance, traveling to Hong Kong. Individually, that could set each claimant back an estimated $65,000. To cover those costs, Liti Capital has promised to provide a minimum of $5 million in funding.

White & Case, a New York-based law firm, has been hired to represent the claimants. Abby Cohen Smutny and Darryl Lew, two White & Case partners based in Washington, D.C., and Hong Kong-based partner Melody Chan, will serve as their lawyers.

2021-08-23,News18,"Cryptocurrency: How to Invest in Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, Other Crypto Coins in India",https://www.news18.com/news/business/cryptocurrency-how-to-invest-in-bitcoin-ether-dogecoin-other-crypto-coins-in-india-4103234.html,"Cryptocurrency is the latest asset class in the financial market which gives you an opportunity to invest and earn a hefty return. Though cryptocurrencies don’t have any official global or governmental backing like your other financial instruments, the popularity they have seen in recent years has been quite robust. Most of this popularity stems from famous billionaire tycoons like Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey actively voicing their opinions on digital currency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum being an asset.

This has brought crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum to the forefront of the public domain and has the average citizen interested in investing in it. It should be noted that recently, the crypto market has taken a beating and prices for some of the most popular coins saw an all-time low. However, experts believe that due to rising demand and interest, the market will recover and even move upwards.

With so much going for cryptocurrency and especially in India where so many are advocating for its classification as an asset, you should know exactly how to invest. Here are the basic steps you need to carry out to successfully invest in cryptocurrency.

Step 1: Finding the Right Crypto Exchange

Cryptocurrencies are not regulated in India, hence there is no established structure or uniformity to trading in cryptocurrency yet. This is where crypto exchanges come in. They act as a platform through which you can buy and sell your digital assets. Some of the more popular exchanges in India include WazirX, CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Step 2: Create your Account

After finalising the exchange that best suits your needs, create an account similar to that in a bank. Depending on the policies you opt for, the amount you plan to invest and what you plan to invest in, the exchange will ask you to verify. They will ask you to submit documentary proofs to prevent cases of fraud.

Step 3: Setting up the Account for Action

Before you can buy any cryptocurrencies, you will need money in your account. The money can be put in via a wire transfer from your normal bank account to the exchange account. Make sure to link both. Also, depending on the policy you may have to face a waiting period before purchases can take place.

Step 4: Buying Cryptocurrency, Making the Investment

Once you have everything set up, you need to pick which coin or coins you may want to invest in. The most popular one by far is Bitcoin, followed by other altcoins such as Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin, Tether, XRP and Dogecoin to name a few. After you make your purchase comes the most important part – storage. Crypto exchanges don’t have any formal institution backing them and they most certainly do not carry your average insurance policy. They also face the risk of being hacked. Therefore, it is important you store your codes to your account and your assets securely. It is often more advisable to store your bought coins in a crypto wallet.

Bitcoin Price Today

Bitcoin price slipped 0.94 per cent in last 24 hours to $44,799.18 on Thursday. Over the last seven days, the coin dropped 0.58 per cent. Other coins such as Ether and Cardano have been trading in red and green respectively. Ether price dropped 1.21 per cent in the last 24 hours to settle at $3,011.60 on Thursday. Meanwhile, Cardano was up by 5.24 per cent at $2.13.

Speaking on the upward trend of Bitcoin, ZebPay Trade Desk said, “Bitcoin has made an impressive comeback over the past week or so, up almost 45 per cent from its recent lows. The market sentiment towards the asset has turned, and gone are the days where people would say that the asset might test $20,000 levels.”

NEW DELHI: Ever since cryptocurrencies arrived on the world investment scene in 2009, their journey has been astonishing.Although there has been a rush of investors jumping on to the crypto bandwagon in the past few years, their volume has not reached anywhere near that of stocks, precious metals, forex and commodities.Online platforms such as Bloomberg and Investopedia have estimated that there are around 1.5 crore crypto investors in India already.More than 350 start-ups have been working in the blockchain and crypto space in India. They estimate that crypto investment from Indians have shot up from $923 million in April 2020 to around $6.6 billion in the last fiscal.But many investors continue to sit on the fence, unable to fully grasp the viability of cryptocurrencies as an investment. To ease them into the system, here we have dope on 7 top cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be born and remains the most powerful until today: very high in value and the most preferred one by investors globally.However, it is also highly volatile and sometimes its price oscillates widely. Some of those who have invested in Bitcoin in the past decade are now millionaires.In Indian Rupee, the cost of one Bitcoin has never come down below Rs 35 lakhs and during the fiscal year 2020-21 it even hit Rs 56 lakh.The volatility had not worried investors as those who invest in whole Bitcoins got their value back plus the premium.Investors buying in fractions need to follow the graphs closely to get a bang for their buck and not lose money. There are hardcore Bitcoin investors who have invested sums as low as Rs 100 and improved their earnings 20-30 times in value. Bitcoin is also a favourite of day traders.Bitcoins are also perceived as precious as they were meant to be finite - there can be no more than 21 million bitcoins created.Believe it or not, this came out of a dog meme that went viral on the internet. Dogecoin was created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Unlike Bitcoin, which is designed to be scarce, the Dogecoin is intentionally abundant — 10,000 new coins are mined every minute and there is no ceiling on the maximum supply.Due to their abundance, small investors are picking them up in sizable volumes. Though its base price is lower than most of the other digital coins, the sheer volume it generates on the exchanges is astounding.Investors are currently wondering if the Dogecoin will ever reach $1 in price. When it does, it will be bonanza time.Ethereum works on a decentralized software platform. It has inbuilt smart contracts and a decentralized applications system.It can be built and operated without any time lag. You can steer clear of dubious transactions and gain full control as an investor in terms of value, transaction and transfer.One extraordinary feature of Ethereum is that it is bereft of any interference or control from any non-specific operators. Ethereum was launched in 2015. Currently it has 19 percent of market capitalisation of the dominant counterpart Bitcoin.Litecoin came into being in 2011. It was one of the first cryptocurrencies following the birth of Bitcoin.It is touted as the silver alter ego of the Golden Bitcoin. But looking at the excitement it has created among the new generation of investors, it may strike gold soon.Litecoin works on a faster block generation rate, which enables the investor to get faster transaction confirmation. So far in 2021, the Litecoin capitalised $10.1 billion and boasts of a value of $153.88 on a per token basis. It is the sixth-largest cryptocurrency in the world.Its founder Charles Hoskinson was one of the five co-founders of Ethereum and it is created in the same genre.Being unhappy with the direction of Ethereum, Hoskinson parted ways and founded Cardano on the environmentally sustainable, Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol with the help of mathematicians, engineers, and cryptographists.Cardano has established a market capitalization of $9.8 billion and each coin trades at $ 0.39.With high interoperability within the blockchains of the same genre, Polkadot perches comfortably among the cryptocurrencies of its size.Polkadot is embedded with systems that enable its developers to create their blockchains.At the same time it is said to be uncompromising on security and safety. At $11.2 billion market capitalization, one DOT has traded for $12.54 since January 2021.Coming from the stable of Bitcoin, BCH has the unique advantage of automatically being connected to Bitcoin. But investors will do well to compare it with non-Bitcoin stable currencies, coins or tokens.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85454009,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-111102,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

India ranks second in the global cryptocurrency adoption index only behind Vietnam, according to the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

The worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency has grown by over 2,300 percent since the third quarter of 2019 and over 881 percent in the last year.

“Our research suggests that reasons for this increased adoption differ around the world — in emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions, while adoption in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia over the last year has been powered largely by institutional investment,” the report said.

The ranking was based on three metrics including peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trading volume and value received. India was followed by Pakistan and Ukraine at rank three and four respectively. The US and China’s ranking dipped from sixth to eighth and from fourth to thirteenth respectively.

The report attributes this drop in ranking to falling P2P volumes in the two countries compared to worldwide volumes.

Most of the top 20 countries are developing countries like Tanzania, Togo and Kenya. “Many emerging markets face significant currency devaluation, driving residents to buy cryptocurrency on P2P platforms in order to preserve their savings. Others in these areas use cryptocurrency to carry out international transactions, either for individual remittances or for commercial use cases, such as purchasing goods to import and sell,” the report said.

“Many emerging markets represented here limit the amount of the national currency that residents can move out of the country. Cryptocurrency gives those residents a way to circumvent those limits so that they can meet their financial needs,” it added.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/07/Cryptocurrency-1-770x433.jpg',)",none

Get your hands-on big income by following these ways to earn cryptocurrency without spending money

‘How to earn money online?’ is a very common question that everybody is interested in. Since the emergence of the internet and online sources, many people are engaging in online activities to get their hands on good income. But winning cryptocurrency through online mode is not the most preferred choice. Well! It should be. Backed by blockchain technology and powered by decentralized mode, cryptocurrency is one of the fastest-growing digital assets. Many people are jumping into the digital currency sphere by investing in it. Although there are multiple ways in which investors can earn cryptocurrency, most of them are less familiar among enthusiasts. Besides, everybody’s favorite cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, also provides many ways to win them without spending anything from your pocket. While some offer bitcoin or fiat currencies in exchange for your time and effort, some others provide crypto-coin which gives you a choice to buy the digital currency of your interest. Unfortunately, finding the right ways to earn cryptocurrency is tough. Therefore, Analytics Insight has listed the top ways to earn cryptocurrency without spending money.

Top Ways to Win Cryptocurrency

Give a Try on Crypto Mining

If you are tech-savvy, then crypto mining is one of the easiest ways you can earn cryptocurrency. However, the process and routines are not the same for all digital currencies. It varies based on the crypto you want to mine. Besides, cryptocurrency mining is also a complicated process. Many think that mining cryptocurrency means you can pick up all the digital currencies you have mined and keep them as yours. But unfortunately, that is not the case in the practical mining process. Miners use their computers to solve complex mathematical equations that validate blocks of transactions. Cryptocurrencies are already created inside a protocol that gets on to the market when it is cracked with valid keys. As a result, the person who engages in the mining process gets a reward. Interested candidates usually join mining networks and engage in mining work with other members.

Engage in DeFi Yield Farming

Similar to crypto mining, decentralized finance projects also need somebody to work for them. But unline mining, is a process of locking the funds in the network. Yield Farming, also known as Liquidity Mining, is a method of locking funds and grant liquidity to a DeFi token. As a result of locking up cryptocurrencies, you will gain a reward. Mostly, the reward comes in form of a digital token. Compound, Kyber Network, and 0x are some of the famous DeFi sources.

Just Shop and get ‘Bitcoin Back’

In a move to promote their platform and fulfill cryptocurrency enthusiasts’ needs, many online sellers are leveraging disruptive ways to attract consumers. One such idea is ‘Bitcoin Back.’ Some online sellers are already engaging in this kind of cryptocurrency back for every purchase customers make on their platform. The recent company to join the game is Lolli, a Google Chrome or Firefox browser extension. Similar to Rakuten and Honey, it offers discounts and cash backs when using the portal to shop online. After making payment, Lolli gives a bitcoin back ranging from 1% to as much as 30%.

Get Cryptos through Airdrop

Although earning cryptocurrency through Airdrop is not a risky task, the providers are at a hectic spot between life and death. Yes, when developers want to gain traction for their new digital currency, they send it as a complement to routine crypto investors to garner adoption. Many crypto trading platforms often engage in Airdrops to publicize new cryptocurrencies. They pick out crypto investors who have a certain amount of existing investment. If you qualify, the platform or developer will send Airdrops directly to your wallet.

Earn Cryptocurrency Dividents

Earning cryptocurrency dividends is one of the easiest ways to earn more cryptocurrency. You just need to buy some cryptos and hold them for a while. In exchange, developers pay you for holding their digital assets. Besides, you don’t even have to stake them in your wallet, just holding them for a while will do the work. The mechanism behind this is that a digital currency’s value goes up based on the number of buyers it gets. Therefore, developers try to attract more buyers by showing that they have a good amount of investors already. COSS, CEFF, KUCOIN, and NEO are some of the famous dividend providers.

Get Employed at Cryptocurrency Companies

There is a never-dying need for workers in the cryptocurrency sphere. Cryptocurrency companies are always looking for candidates who can fill digital marketing, content creation, and web designing profiles. Some even offer work at employees’ convenience like remote mode, flexible working hours, and part-times. Besides, the companies also offer competitive packages. Therefore, if you happen to come across one, don’t hesitate and take up the opportunity.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Top-Ways-to-Earn-Cryptocurrency-Without-Spending-Money.jpg',)",none
2021-08-23,Gadgets 360,"Cryptocurrency Scam Involving $22 Million Uncovered in UK, Victims Spread Across the World",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-fraud-ether-price-in-india-ethereum-manchester-police-usd-22-million-usb-drives-2513913,"Cryptocurrencies worth $22.2 million (roughly Rs. 165 crores) have been seized by the UK police after a global fraud scheme was unearthed. They have found USB sticks containing large quantities of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world after Bitcoin. The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the scheme cheated people from the UK, US, Europe, China, Australia, and Hong Kong. The victims deposited money, some even their entire life's savings, believing it to be a genuine saving and trading service using Binance Smart Chain. Two people were arrested for alleged fraud and money laundering, but they have been released under investigation.

The discovery has brought into focus the anonymous and international nature of these virtual currencies. Criminals often take advantage of anonymity to launder money and for terrorism, tax fraud, and drug trafficking. Although a majority of cryptocurrency transactions are legitimate, many are also fraudulent.

GMP's Economic Crime Unit said a total of $9.5 million (roughly Rs. 70.6 crores) in stolen Ethereum was discovered in the seized USB sticks. The police found another $12.7 million (roughly Rs. 94.4 crores) a few days later after finding an online safe (a cryptograph safety deposit box) and its access code.

The GMP said they have begun locating the rightful owners, some of whom are still unknown and spread across the world, and reuniting them with their money.

One of the victims of the fraud, who wished to remain anonymous, told the police that he had been using cryptocurrency for years. “The hack really surprised us at first,” he added, thanking the police for tracking the money.

GMP said the victim will now get 90 percent of his investment back and if all the funds remain unclaimed, he will receive the full amount.

Detective Chief Inspector Joe Harrop of the Economic Crime Unit said people are increasingly moving online and see cryptocurrency as the future of money and trading. But this shift is also leading to a new type of crime and opportunist criminals are looking to exploit these trends as well as any gaps in the technology. Harrop said policing also needs to adapt to this emerging type of crime.

As of August 19 (12:10pm IST), Ether price in India stood at Rs. 2.33 lakhs.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/ethereum_red_reuters_1627626041391.jpg',)",none

Using factors like peer-to-peer exchange trading volume and value received, Chainalysis said global cryptocurrency adoption rose some 881 percent in the past 12 months.

The firm sees institutional markets as crucial but aimed to highlight the countries with the greatest cryptocuurrency adoption by retail investors. It focused on use cases related to transactions and individual saving, rather than trading and speculation. Top-ranked countries are Vietnam, India, Pakistan, and Ukraine.

“In emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions,” Chainalysis said in the report. It added that “adoption in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia over the last year has been powered largely by institutional investment.”

Interest in cryptocurrencies has surged since the onset of the pandemic, in part because of substantial gains by digital tokens like Bitcoin and Ether. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index has climbed about 380 percent in the past year. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 34.71 lakhs while Ethereum price in India stood at Rs. 2.34 lakhs as of 10am IST on August 19.

The Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index ranked 154 countries by three main metrics. China and the US both dropped in the rankings, primarily because peer-to-peer trading volume declined. Last year, China ranked fourth and the US sixth. This year, the US is eighth and China 13th.

Chainalysis took out one factor it had used previously: number of deposits by country weighted by number of Internet users. The firm found that it skewed the rankings toward countries with comparatively more decentralised finance, or DeFi, users. Instead, it's creating a DeFi Adoption Index that it said will be available in coming weeks.

“Growing transaction volume for centralized services and the explosive growth of DeFi are driving cryptocurrency usage in the developed world and in countries that already had substantial adoption, while P2P platforms are driving new adoption in emerging markets,' Chainalysis said, adding a key question is whether new approaches will disrupt those trends.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped Bitcoin rally.

Key Highlights Many retail investors are now opening accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges to trade/invest in this asset class. Like stocks, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined by demand, supply and market dynamics. Similar to stocks, cryptocurrency transaction on an exchange involves certain transaction costs.

New Delhi: Gradually cryptocurrencies are finding a place in the portfolios of retail investors as they believe this asset class will soon emerge as the most lucrative asset class of the 21st century. Many retail investors are now opening accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges to trade/invest in this asset class. Like stocks, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined by demand, supply and market dynamics. Similar to stocks, cryptocurrency transaction on an exchange involves certain transaction costs. New investors should be aware of the costs involved in cryptocurrency trading. Here are the different transaction costs levied by crypto exchanges.

Exchange/trading fees: Exchange fee or trading fee is the amount charged by the cryptocurrency exchange for executing a buy or sell transaction. Typically, in India, crypto exchanges charge transaction fee as a fixed percentage of trade value. For example, WazirX, which is a cryptocurrency exchange, follows a flat fee structure of 0.2% for everyone. ""People can also pay trading fee using WRX on WazirX to avail 50% discount on fees, thereby making it the lowest trading fee in India at just 0.1%,"" said Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX.

Some crypto exchanges also follow a variable fee model depending on the volume of trading. If you are an active trader or you have transacted a high value over a longer rolling period, you may negotiate a lower trading fee with the exchange. So, investors are advised to do their own research before registering with a particular exchange so that they can get the best brokerage as per their trading volume.

It may be noted that exchange fee is the primary source of revenue for crypto exchanges and forms an integral part of their business model.

Network fees: Other than exchange fees or trading fees, crypto investors will also have to pay network fee, which is payable to the cryptocurrency miners for the work they do. Crypto miners are individuals who work with powerful computers to verify and validate transactions to be added to a blockchain. Miners play an integral role in crypto transactions by ensuring that tokens weren’t spent twice and transactions are real and true.

Worth mentioning here is that cryptocurrency exchanges have no direct control over the network fees and it is payable to the miners/validator of the network. When the network becomes crowded on the back of high demand, network fees may increase. Miners are paid these fees for the electricity and vast processing power required to process crypto transactions.

Wallet fees: This fee is similar to the demat fee that we pay for trading in shares. Cryptocurrencies are stored in a digital wallet, which is like an online bank account, meant for the safekeeping of the cryptocurrency. These digital wallets make it easier for you to use the cryptocurrency and send it to others.

Most of the wallets don’t charge any fee for holding the cryptocurrency but charge a fee at the time of withdrawing/sending cryptocurrency from the wallet which is basically network fees. ""We don't charge any fees on holding crypto in your WazirX wallet. We do charge crypto withdrawal fee and it is the lowest in India starting from zero fee,"" said Nischal Shetty of WazirX.

Worth mentioning here is that crypto wallets also offer systematic cryptocurrency buying options and have integrated merchant gateway service using which you can pay for transactions such as smartphone recharge, DTH recharge using cryptocurrency.","('https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/1564484114-cryptocurrency_getty.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top',)",none
2021-08-23,CNBC,This map shows where cryptocurrency is taking off around the world,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/new-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-user-global-map.html,"Global adoption of cryptocurrency has taken off in the last year, up 881%, with Vietnam, India and Pakistan firmly in the lead, according to new data from Chainalysis. It is the second year the blockchain data firm has released its Global Crypto Adoption Index, which ranks 154 countries according to metrics such as peer-to-peer exchange trading volume, rather than gross transaction volume, which typically favors developed nations with high levels of professional and institutional crypto buy-in. Chainalysis said the purpose of the index is to capture crypto adoption by ""ordinary people"" and to ""focus on use cases related to transactions and individual saving, rather than trading and speculation."" The metrics are weighted to incorporate the wealth of the average person and the value of money generally within particular countries. Most of the top 20 countries are emerging economies, including Togo, Colombia and Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the United States slipped from sixth to eighth place, and China, which cracked down on crypto this spring, dropped from fourth to 13th.

Chainalysis ascribes the rising adoption levels in emerging markets to a few key factors. For one, countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, Vietnam and Venezuela have huge transaction volumes on peer-to-peer, or P2P, platforms when adjusted for purchasing power parity per capita and the internet-using population. Chainalysis reports that many residents use P2P cryptocurrency exchanges as their primary on-ramp into cryptocurrency, often because they don't have access to centralized exchanges. The report also says many residents of these countries turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, as well as to send and receive remittances and carry out business transactions.

Matt Ahlborg, a peer-to-peer data analyst, told CNBC that Vietnam is one of the top markets for Bitrefill, a company that helps customers live on cryptocurrency by buying gift cards using bitcoin. ""Vietnam stood out to me because it dominated the index,"" said Chainalysis' director of research, Kim Grauer, who compiled the report. ""We heard from experts that people in Vietnam have a history of gambling, and the young, tech-savvy people don't have much to do with their funds in terms of investing in a traditional ETF, both of which drive crypto adoption,"" Grauer said.

2021-08-23,CNBC,"Nvidia beats earnings expectations, but cryptocurrency chip sales falter",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/nvidia-nvda-earnings-q2-2022.html,"Nvidia's graphics segment, which is primarily made up of graphics cards, grew 87% to $3.91 billion, growing faster than the compute and network segment, which includes chips for data centers. Compute and network grew 46% to $2.6 billion.

Graphics chips like Nvidia makes are increasingly important for a variety of technologies including gaming, artificial intelligence and types of cryptocurrency mining.

Nvidia is in a period of sustained, massive growth in its business as semiconductors are in short supply worldwide and as demand for the kind of processors that the company specializes in skyrockets. Nvidia's revenue rose 68% annually during the quarter. In the previous quarter, sales grew 84% .

However, Nvidia's cryptocurrency chip product, CMP, had lower sales, at $266 million, than the $400 million the company predicted in May. Shares of Nvidia were up more than 2% in after-hours trading.

Nvidia reported earnings on Wednesday for its second fiscal quarter , which ended Aug. 1, beating Wall Street estimates because of strong graphics card sales.

Broken down by market instead of reportable segment, one highlight was gaming, which was up 85% to $3.06 billion. Nvidia has had supply issues since late last year as its latest line of graphics cards has remained mostly sold out in stores, and the company said in May that it expected supply issues through the second half of the year. The company said Wednesday that it was seeing longer lead times throughout its supply chain.

Nvidia said the increase in gaming sales was due to both GeForce graphics card sales as well as the chips it sells to game console makers, such as the processor at the heart of the Nintendo Switch.

Nvidia's data center business also hit an all-time high, growing 35% annually to $2.37 billion, which the company attributed to graphics cards for data centers, both in industrial uses and among cloud providers.

Investors are closely watching how correlated Nvidia's business is to cryptocurrency prices.

Cryptocurrency revenue fell short of expectations, reporting $266 million in cryptocurrency card sales, more than 33% lower than expectations. Nvidia forecast in May that the dedicated chips it makes for mining cryptocurrency, called CMP, would have sales of around $400 million in the August quarter.

Nvidia says its cryptocurrency cards are an effort to ensure there is enough chip supply for gamers and it applied software to its GPUs to prevent them from mining cryptocurrencies. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that it expects a ""minimal contribution"" from its CMP sales going forward.

Nvidia's professional visualization segment, mostly graphics cards for high-end professional workstations, were up 156% annually to $519 million. Its automotive business remains a small portion of the company's sales, with $152 million in sales, down sequentially from the most recent quarter and up 37% from the same quarter last year, which was in the middle of the global Covid-19 pandemic that snarled auto production.

Last year, Nvidia said it planned to buy Arm, which makes important intellectual property for mobile chips, for $40 billion. The deal is opposed by some of Nvidia's competitors, which worry that they may lose access to important Arm technology.

""Although some Arm licensees have expressed concerns or objected to the transaction, and discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought, we are confident in the deal and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, its licensees, and the industry,"" Nvidia said in a statement.

Nvidia split its stock 4-for-1 in June. Shares are up over 57% in the last year.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106747420-1602840895304-GettyImages-902419318_1.jpg?v=1602842165',)",none

Larry Dean Harmon, 38, of Akron, agreed as part of his plea in Washington, D.C., federal court to surrender more than 4,400 bitcoins, currently valued at more than $200 million, the Justice Department said Wednesday.

Harmon, who maintained a residence in the nation of Belize during his criminal activity, also faces assessment of a $60 million civil monetary penalty from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, authorities said.

He will be sentenced at a date to be scheduled. He faces a maximum prison term of 20 years and potential fines of hundreds of millions of dollars.

The Darknet is the collection of websites hidden from normal search engines and web browsers. Its anonymized nature is exploited by criminals who trade weapons, narcotics and illegal services.

As part of his guilty plea, Harmon admitted that his Darknet-based service, Helix, partnered with several Darknet markets, such as AlphaBay, Evolution and Cloud 9, to provide bitcoin money laundering services for customers, the Justice Department said.

Helix, which Harmon ran from 2014 through 2017, was known as a ""mixer"" or ""tumbler"" of bitcoin. For a fee, Helix would send bitcoin to recipients in a way that hid who was sending that cryptocurrency.

Helix was linked with and associated with a Darknet search called ""Grams,"" which was also run by Harmon, who ""advertised Helix to customers on the Darknet to conceal transactions from law enforcement,"" the Justice Department said.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929924-1629309517996-gettyimages-959428194-bs_4561.jpeg?v=1629309551',)",none

Robinhood said crypto accounted for more than half of all transaction-based sales in the second quarter, and 62% of crypto revenue came from dogecoin, a meme-inspired digital coin originally started as a joke. In its first earnings report since its IPO last month, Robinhood said its revenue from crypto transactions was $233 million, up from $5 million in the year-ago quarter. Crypto accounted for 52% of transaction-based revenue, rising from 17% in the first quarter and 4% in the fourth quarter of last year. The company also noted that more than 60% of cumulative net-funded accounts traded crypto in the quarter. ""The three months ended June 30, 2021 is the first quarter where a larger share of new customers placed their first trade in crypto rather than equities,"" Robinhood said in the earnings statement.

While Robinhood gained popularity by bringing free stock trading to a new generation of investors, the company has also been a big beneficiary of the surge in cryptocurrency markets. The app allows investors to buy and sell seven digital currencies, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, dogecoin, ethereum and litecoin. Cryptocurrencies had a particularly volatile second quarter. The price of bitcoin plunged by more than 40% after a huge rally in 2020, though it has since recouped much of that value. Ethereum, meanwhile, rose by about 18%, and dogecoin more than quadrupled in value.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106884095-1621274532356-gettyimages-1232878889-Dogecoins.jpeg?v=1621274619',)",none
2021-08-23,MarketWatch,"Bitcoin is king of crypto but ‘Ethereum’s ascent to the top of the cryptoverse seems unstoppable,’ says analyst",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-is-king-of-crypto-but-ethereums-ascent-to-the-top-of-the-cryptoverse-seems-unstoppable-says-analyst-11629313818,"Bitcoin, the world’s No. 1 crypto and the genesis of the current revolution in digital assets may one day bow down to a new king of the sector, speculates a researcher.

“Ethereum will continue to outperform Bitcoin in 2021 and will, ultimately, exceed its rival’s value,” wrote Nigel Green, chief executive and founder of deVere Group, a large financial advisory firm and asset manager, in a Wednesday note.

Green makes the case that bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.11% which was launched in a white paper in 2008 may cede its dominance to Ethereum’s Ether ETHUSD, -0.86% , which is viewed by some as boasting a clearer use case than bitcoin which is considered by some as digital gold.

Bitcoin’s value in 2021 is up 57%, while Ether’s has risen 318%, at last check on CoinDesk.

By comparison, traditional assets have seen far more mundane returns. The S&P 500 index SPX has gained more than 18% in the year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA is up 15% thus far in 2021, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP has risen almost 14% and gold futuresGC00 are down almost 6%, FactSet data show.

Bitcoin’s major marketing point has been its claim by enthusiasts to be a store of value and as a currency to a lesser extent, but Ethereum’s network is viewed by many as a powerful, open-source, decentralized backbone off which a number of applications can be based.

Ether, launched in 2015 by a team including Vitarik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, and Gavin Wood, allows software developers to write bespoke programs atop its network. Sometimes these applications are referred to as smart contracts.

Ether bulls make the case that the world’s No. 2 crypto by market cap is the most in-demand development platform, thereby highlighting the Ethereum network’s “value not only as a platform for developers but as a worldwide financial utility,” wrote Green.

Ethereum also serves as the backbone of a number of popular and groundbreaking platforms, including decentralized finance networks, or DeFi, nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, and DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations.

Those growing uses have gummed up Ether’s works but that is seen changing in coming months.

A key upgrade to the Ether network, which includes a phased shift from a proof-of-work protocol to a proof-of-stake and increased storage capacity and processing power for smart contracts, is under way.

Put simply, a proof-of-work network requires tremendous amounts of computing power to verify the distributed-ledger network, which is the foundation of traditional crypto, while a proof-of-stake requires proof of ownership and is considered more environmentally friendly because it reduces the carbon footprint of verifying transactions on the blockchain and paying out rewards to those “miners” who underpin the network.

The process of investors staking their Ether in preparation for the upgrade to Ethereum also has been credited in buoying prices of the digital asset.

“These upgrades represent a major boost not just for Ethereum but for blockchain technology itself,” writes Green. “Ultimately, this will mean that its value will exceed that of Bitcoin—probably within five years,” he predicts.

Green is hardly the first to speculate that Ether will supplant Ether one day. Industry enthusiasts even have a name for it: the flippening. The flippening is the day that Ethereum overtakes bitcoin in market value.

Still, bitcoin remains the dominant player, representing 44% of the nearly $1.96 trillion in crypto market value compared with Ether’s nearly 19%, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

To be sure, it is impossible to know which, if any, crypto will survive much less become the most dominant. Scrutiny of the sector is intensifying as regulators look to put up guardrails to protect would-be investors and central banks contemplate the use of central bank digital currencies and stablecoins, which could also pose existential threats to the extant array of crypto assets.","('https://images.mktw.net/im-319813/social',)",none
2021-08-23,Mint,India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption in the world,https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/india-ranks-second-in-terms-of-crypto-adoption-in-the-world-11629306088082.html,"NEW DELHI : India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption worldwide behind Vietnam, but ahead of countries such as the US, UK, and China, according to the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

This comes even as worldwide crypto adoption grew by 880% between June 2020 and July 2021, according to the report.

A report by US-based research platform Finder released this month corroborated that the top five countries in terms of crypto adoption were all from Asia.

The company surveyed 47,000 users worldwide and 30% of those surveyed in India said they owned cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the most popular coin in India, followed by Ripple, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash, according to the report.

India’s “huge expatriate population"" makes it the world’s number one remittance recipient in the crypto space, Finder said. India had the largest expatriate population in the world, with 18 million people from the country living outside their homeland last year, noted a January 2021 UN report.

Crypto adoption in India has also been led by smaller towns in the country. The largest crypto exchange in the country by trading volume, WazirX, said last week that it had seen more than 2,648% growth in user sign-ups from tier II and tier III cities in India.

The exchange has a claimed user base of 7.3 million users and said it has clocked more than $21.8 billion in trading volumes this year.

Competitor Coinswitch Kuber, which ranks among the top crypto exchanges in India by trading volumes, noted the same trend. It saw a 135% monthly growth in user sign-ups from smaller towns, which made up 61% of the exchange’s total business. Trading volumes from these cities in the last six months were close to ₹431 billion, said Sharan Nair, chief business officer of the company.

The interest is mostly driven by referrals, said Naimish Sanghvi, who has been running crypto information platform Coin Crunch since 2018. The fact that cryptocurrencies have made money for many individuals almost overnight has drawn more such users to the space, especially from smaller towns, he said. However, serious investors who will get in the space for the long term are yet to really take interest.

Global crypto adoption among ordinary investors has surged in the past year, according to crypto-analysis firm Chainalysis.

Using factors like peer-to-peer exchange trading volume and value received, Chainalysis said global crypto adoption has risen by more than 881% in the past year.

While the firm sees professional and institutional markets as crucial, it aimed to highlight the countries with the greatest crypto adoption by retail investors — focusing on use cases related to transactions and individual saving, rather than trading and speculation. The top countries in the ranking are Vietnam, India, Pakistan and Ukraine.

“In emerging markets, many turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, send and receive remittances, and carry out business transactions,” Chainalysis said in the report, “while adoption in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia over the last year has been powered largely by institutional investment.”

Interest in cryptocurrencies has surged in the past year along with prices. Bitcoin has more than tripled in the past 12 months, while second-biggest crypto Ether is up about sevenfold — and many other top cryptocurrencies have registered strong gains as well.

The firm’s Global Crypto Adoption Index ranked 154 countries by three main metrics. China and the U.S. both dropped in the rankings, primarily because peer-to-peer trading volume declined.

Chainalysis took out one factor it had used in previous analysis: number of deposits by country weighted by number of internet users. However, the firm found that it skewed the rankings toward countries with comparatively more decentralized finance, or DeFi, users. Instead, it’s creating a DeFi Adoption Index that it said will be available in coming weeks.

“Growing transaction volume for centralized services and the explosive growth of DeFi are driving cryptocurrency usage in the developed world and in countries that already had substantial adoption, while P2P platforms are driving new adoption in emerging markets,’ the Chainalysis report said. “Our biggest question for the next 12 months is how much adoption will continue on those platform categories compared to new and emerging models we haven’t seen yet.”","('https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bitcoin.jpg?resize=1200%2C630',)",none
2021-08-23,The Motley Fool,"Why Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Dropped Today",https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/18/why-bitcoin-dogecoin-and-ethereum-dropped-today/,"What happened

Cryptocurrency prices traded sharply lower Wednesday, with Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) prices down 2% over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coindesk. As of 10:15 a.m. EDT, Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) investors are being treated to a 4.9% decline, while Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) is suffering worst of all -- down 9.6%.

The question is why?

So what

Today's headlines contain a couple of notes that may be worrying cryptocurrency investors. On the one hand, Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari just went on record at the Pacific Northwest Economic Regional Annual Summit in Big Sky, Montana, blasting the entire cryptocurrency industry as ""95% fraud, hype, noise, and confusion."" He proceeded to label cryptocurrencies ""garbage coins"" and ""Ponzi schemes,"" and warned investors that cryptocurrencies aim to ""dupe people into investing money and then the founders rip them off.""

(Geez, Mr. Kashkari! Don't sugarcoat it. Tell us what you really think!)

Perhaps worse, says the regional Federal Reserve head, ""I've not seen any use case [for Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies] other than funding illicit activities like drugs and prostitution."" And if you think comments like this one might attract the attention of federal law enforcers, you're right.

As Politico reported yesterday: ""Federal regulators are pursuing cryptocurrency start-ups in court. ... Over the past month alone, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury Department announced more than $120 million in penalties aimed at digital currency exchanges and other service providers that officials said weren't complying with federal markets regulations and anti-money-laundering requirements.""

Nor is the action restricted to the federal level, with Politico pointing out that ""several states also escalated their own crypto enforcement crackdowns this summer.""

Now what

Now, investors might be inclined to dismiss Kashkari's comments as the disgruntled ravings of a dollar-focused bureaucrat who doesn't possess the powers of, say, the SEC, to unilaterally impose regulations on virtual currencies. The rising tide of enforcement actions at both the federal and state levels, however, suggests that the government really is concerned about abuses in the cryptocurrency industry, and beginning to take action to rein them in.

Consider, too, SEC Chair Gary Gensler's comments -- who does have enforcement powers -- blasting the crypto industry for its ""fraud, scams, and abuse"" earlier this month. That language was eerily similar to the sentiments Kashkari voiced yesterday, suggesting there is a consensus forming in government that the crypto industry requires regulation.

If that makes cryptocurrency investors just a wee bit nervous this morning, I can't say I blame them.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/639782/red-stock-market-chart-with-arrows-pointing-down-and-a-bitcoin-symbol.jpg',)",none

After years of silence, the Dogecoin Foundation is back after six years and its new advisory board includes Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Jared Birchall, who heads Elon Musk’s family office, as advisors.In an announcement yesterday, the Foundation announced its re-establishment with “renewed focus” to support the ecosystem and community built around the cryptocurrency . The Dogecoin Foundation is a non-profit organization that was first launched in 2014 but had been dissolved over time.Max Keller, a core developer for the Dogecoin project, will also serve as a technical adviser, while founder Shibetoshi Nakamoto will be the community and memes advisor.In its announcement, the Foundation said it is not here to “take control” of the Dogecoin Core Wallet project but to accelerate development efforts around the crypto token. The Dogecoin Core Wallet is the official wallet for holding Dogecoin that’s maintained by the foundation.“We are here to accelerate the development effort by supporting current Dogecoin Core and future Dogecoin Developers to work on a full-time basis through sponsorship, as well as providing a welcome landing for new contributors hoping to help with the project,” the foundation said in its announcement.It also hopes to raise a three-year budget, which will be used to hire a staff that will look after its day-to-day activities.While Musk has been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin lately, Buterin had famously donated 50% of the supply of Shiba Inu tokens to a crypto covid relief fund in India earlier this year. The developers of the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency had put 50% of the coin’s supply in a public wallet owned by Buterin, and many saw the donation as Buterin’s way of withdrawing support for meme-based cryptos like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin.Further, the Foundation also plans to announce new projects on Dogecoin soon. Its website has space for the project roadmap, which it claims is “being drafted” right now and will be announced “shortly”. “The Dogecoin Foundation is also looking to the future of the broader Dogecoin ecosystem, and in coming weeks, will be announcing new projects that will compliment the current Core Wallet to enable faster integration and easier APIs for Financial, Social and Charitable projects wishing to use Dogecoin,” the announcement said.It’s unclear why the Dogecoin Foundation chose to return at this time, but it could be because the coin has drawn flak from the broader crypto ecosystem. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have often been accused of reducing the overall industry’s credibility since they were both made as joke coins at first. At the moment, Coinmarketcap ranks the token as one of its top cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of nearly $40 billion.The Foundation also announced that it now owns the Dogecoin Logo and mark, and will maintain it for the community, fighting efforts to co-opt the currency. “For many years, the Dogecoin community has continued to think the best of people and hoped that everyone could play nicely with the name and logos. Dogecoin belongs to the people after all,” the foundation said in its post. “However, in recent times, numerous attempts have been made to co-opt the ‘Dogecoin’ brand in various jurisdictions, in ways that would prevent the community and the project itself from using them,” it added.

2021-08-16,Cointelegraph,Ethereum ‘liquidity crisis’ could see new ETH all-time high before Bitcoin — Analyst,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-liquidity-crisis-could-see-new-eth-all-time-high-before-bitcoin-analyst,"Ethereum‘s native token, Ether (ETH), may beat Bitcoin (BTC) to new all-time highs, fresh analysis reveals.

In a tweet on Wednesday, Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant, highlighted a “sell-side liquidity crisis” that could yet give ETH the edge over BTC.

Ether liquidity shortfall “intensifying”

With Bitcoin up over 50% versus its lows of $29,000, altcoins have also begun to reawaken, with Ether as no exception.

The largest altcoin has recaptured $3,000, a level that, this week, is now in the process of being retested as support.

Despite attention focusing on Bitcoin reclaiming $50,000, optimism over Ether remains high after its successful London hard fork deployment earlier this month.

Thanks in part to the supply changes pushed through via the hard fork, a liquidity shortfall could ultimately serve to push ETH/USD to new historic peaks before BTC/USD manages to do the same.

“$ETH might reach its all-time high earlier than $BTC in the long term,” Ki summarized.

“Current $ETH price is closer to ATH compared to $BTC. Higher demand, lower supply. $ETH sell-side liquidity crisis still intensifies, while $BTC exchange reserve stopped its downward trend in May.”

In terms of numbers, Bitcoin exchange reserves have been declining since May, only to return in late July. From a peak of 2.54 million on July 26, BTC reserves then declined to 2.44 million this week.

By contrast, ETH has seen a mostly linear downtrend since late May’s local high of 21.43 million held on exchanges. As of this week, the exchange balance is around 19.25 million.

Battle of the supply shocks

Ki is not alone in forecasting a more rampant bull charge for Ether compared to Bitcoin.

As Cointelegraph reported, Bloomberg Intelligence has also come out favoring ETH over BTC in a recent report, even forecasting a “flippening” of the largest cryptocurrency.

Meanwhile, data continues to show a supply shock underway for Bitcoin as well — something that has its own historical precedent for sparking BTC price run-ups.

“Illiquid Supply Shock ratio has been a good leading indicator over the past few months,” analyst William Clemente III commented on the latest figures from fellow on-chain analytics resource Glassnode.

“Impulses in both directions have resulted in price action following. As the metric continues to grind slowly upward, currently at levels prev. 58K BTC, watching for another major impulse.”

Concerns about cryptocurrencies were raised Tuesday by Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

Kashkari contrasted the open nature of the crypto field with the U.S. government’s monopoly on issuance of dollars.

""There are thousands of these garbage coins that have been created,"" the central banker went on. ""Some of them are complete fraud Ponzi schemes. They dupe people into investing money and then the founders rip them off.""

Kashkari scoffed at the idea that bitcoin could serve as a safe haven from inflation, particularly the kind seen in some developing countries.

In other cryptocurrency news, Australian bitcoin miner Iris Energy said Wednesday it has applied for a direct listing on the Nasdaq, according to Reuters.

It raised as much as $130 million earlier in the year, to develop and expand its operations in British Columbia, Canada, where it mines bitcoin using green hydroelectric power from a local electricity generator.

Bloomberg had reported that the company was in talks to raise about $200 million ahead of its proposed Nasdaq listing.

Why only individual investors are flocking to invest in these virtual currencies but not the big players yet? To be fair, some institutions like MicroStrategy and Tesla have already invested in crypto. But most of the big names haven't yet. Shark Tank star and investor Kevin O'Leary said this is because most big investors want “compliance.” The Canadian businessman dismissed the notion that institutional investors are scared of the volatility, saying rather “they want to play.”

In most parts of the world, cryptocurrency has not received regulatory approval but digital coin trading is allowed.

In an interview with CryptoPotato, O'Leary — popularly known as ""Mr Wonderful"" from the reality TV series — said, “It's one thing to put a small amount of money to work but when you start talking about a 10 percent allocation of a large pool of capital, you need to integrate that with your compliance system and your accounting system, and your external reporting system.”

O'Leary recently bought a stake in FTX crypto exchange and signed a multi-year deal to become its ambassador and spokesperson. He will be paid in cryptocurrency. He said he is a “test case” for institutions to see whether they should join the rapidly evolving market. Previously, he said he has solved his compliance problems with cryptocurrencies.

Finally solved my compliance problems with #cryptocurrencies I'm going to use FTX to increase my allocation and use the platform to manage my portfolios https://t.co/yaoRUnXy14 — Kevin O'Leary aka Mr. Wonderful (@kevinolearytv) August 10, 2021

In February this year, O'Leary told Bitcoin.com that he has invested 3 percent of his portfolio in Bitcoin and Ether, the two most popular crypto coins.

But “Mr Wonderful” was not always excited about cryptocurrency. Although he owned some Ethereum and Bitcoin personally in 2017, the millionaire investor said he remained outside the cryptocurrency business for long because of the regulatory environment.

Now he is investing in it because the “facts” have changed. “When facts change, I change. I'm a pragmatic investor, I allocate capital along a wide range of asset classes.” He said most of the big, institutional investors are in the Bitcoin business because they see it as a property. O'Leary also said he doesn't think any other cryptocurrency will overtake Bitcoin in terms of market dominance.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/kevin_o_leary_shark_tank_abc_1629274618398.jpg',)",none

Profit booking activity spiked during the past 24 hours, leading to significant value erosion.

Bitcoin, which was inching closer to $48,000 a couple of days ago, has now fallen to $45,000. It was down over 1.4 per cent at 1 pm today. The market capitalisation of Bitcoin has fallen to $848 billion, down over 32 billion from Tuesday.

Ether, the second-most popular cryptocurrency in the world, also fell by 3 per cent and was trading at just over $3,000. Ether’s market capitalisation has dipped to $357 billion.

All other altcoins including XRP, Cardano, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Polkadot and Uniswap also fell sharply in the range of 2-9 per cent.

Traders should proceed with caution as the cryptocurrency market is likely to be under pressure for the next 24 hours.

Commenting on the virtual coin market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The past 24 hours were yet another profit booking session. Most of the other Altcoins shed off their gains from the past few days.”

“BTC investors would be on their edge as BTC has again dropped below the psychological level of $45,000. This drop has led to the addition of several new short positions dragging the markets even lower,” he added.

“We can expect the markets to remain under pressure over the coming 24 hours.”

Here are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:

In an interview to The Economic Times, Sitharaman has said that cryptocurrency is a very big potential area where a lot of global developments are taking place.

""We cannot be moving ahead as if this doesn't exist. We are not saying no to cryptocurrency. We are saying we will have to see how this technology can help fintech to maximise the potential it has. But how sophisticated regulation can be is something which I want to work with the RBI,"" she told the newspaper.

The finance minister also said that the work was nearly complete and the cabinet had to decide on it now.

Asked about the privatisation of BPCL and Air India, Sitharaman said she was optimistic that the process would be completed by 2021-end.

""When the government lets go of its ownership, there is far more due diligence that has to be adhered to. There is the complete unglamorous backroom work. You will feel probably it is not happening. But the details of what happens at the back are unglamorous but completely necessary,"" she stated.

Questioned if the LIC IPO is on track, Sitharaman said yes. She added that details of the stake to be divested would be divulged in due course.

Amid China's crackdown on technology, the Finance Minister said that India is probably ideally situated to attract businesses looking to move out of China.

Top Cryptocurrency Prices",https://www.news18.com/news/business/bitcoin-price-today-drops-below-45000-ether-binance-slip-top-cryptocurrency-rates-4098074.html,"The price of Bitcoin continued to drop on Wednesday as it was trading below its $46,000 high. Over the last 24 hours, it has been trading 3.81 per cent lower. Over the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has been trading 1.75 per cent lower. The price of Bitcoin stood at $44,950.92 at the time of this article. On the other hand, the dominance of Bitcoin in the market was 44.36 per cent, which was an increase of 0.71 per cent over the day. It should be noted that it was not only Bitcoin that was trading in the red. The overall crypto market was trading red over the past 24 hours according to data gathered from CoinMarketCap.

Other major coins such as Ethereum and Binance were also trading red. Ether, on Wednesday, showed a price of $3,026.00 which was 5.65 per cent lower over the past 24 hours. The drop over the course of the past seven days was listed as 4.03 per cent as per information on CoinMarketCap. Binance Coin, the third strongest coin slipped 8.16 per cent over the last 24 hours, which left the price of the crypto at $393.11. Over the last seven days, the coin has been trading at a lower 3.96 per cent. Another popular Altcoin, Dogecoin, was trading at $0.2936 or 10.71 per cent lower over the last 24 hours. However, the price overall was trading green over the course of the last week at 12.58 per cent.

Speaking on the performance of Bitcoin, Ether and Dogecoin, Edul Patel, the CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex said, “It was yet another choppy session for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin got dragged down by the bears in the past 24 hours, as we noticed a huge number of short positions opening up. After the recent rally, the largest crypto by market cap has been tightly range-bound. The largest Altcoin by market capitalization, Ether too faced a similar sell-off.""

Patel added, “Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency developed initially as a meme coin, witnessed quite a roller coaster ride over the past 24 hours. DOGE was the third-highest traded coin over after Bitcoin and Ethereum. Since the bears appeared to have the upper hand on DOGE, it could indicate that the meme coin would likely remain under pressure throughout the week. Some of the Altcoins like MATIC and Solana still had a pretty decent trading session. These are definitely exciting times for the altcoins, as the blue chips in crypto are consolidating.""

The global crypto market cap was listed as $1.90 trillion, which was a 4.95 per cent decline over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours was $126.78 billion which made for a 4.08 per cent increase. The total DeFi volume was $17.52 billion or 13.82 per cent of the total crypto market’s 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins was standing at $101.37 billion, which was 79.96 per cent of the total crypto market volume of the last 24 hours.

Siddharth Menon the COO of WazirX said, “The Altcoin market has broken out of the rectangle pattern after 3 months of consolidation. Upmove till $1.45 Trillion is expected after the breakout, Solana has entered into top 10 ranking by touching new ATH (All Time High). These are some strong signals of the Bull market where these Alts make new highs ahead of Bitcoin and Ether. Cardano is short of 10% from its previous ATH.”

“Markets are offering favourable risk:reward at this stage. One should always trade or invest with caution in crypto markets as it is a highly volatile market. Risk should be given top priority over reward while you approach any market,” Menon added.

2021-08-16,News18,EXPLAINED: Why Best Thing About Cryptocurrency May Be The Blockchain Tech That Anchors It,https://www.news18.com/news/explainers/explained-why-the-best-thing-about-cryptocurrency-may-be-the-blockchain-tech-that-anchors-it-4098050.html,"Many of us have increasingly become used to making transactions using digital wallets and online payment systems. We are also exhorted to never share our PIN numbers and passwords to prevent hackers and fraudsters from breaking into out account and stealing money. So, while the transactions are digital, the fears are pretty analog, akin to having our pocket picked or property burgled. Such worries though are largely non-existent in the world of cryptocurrency for all the talk of the unsavoury ways in which they are used. That is because of the blockchain technology underlying cryptocurrencies, which ensure that it is terribly difficult to tamper with records or get away with unauthorised transactions.

What Is The Blockchain?

It’s a combination of two words ‘block’ and ‘chain’, and the meaning is quite direct. To begin with, what you need to know is that Bitcoin — the earliest and the most valuable cryptocurrency — records transactions in tranches known as ‘blocks’, and then adds such one block to another in a continuing ‘chain’ of all transactions. Much like a ledger or an account book, where entries are listed one below the other. Except that here there is no single person who records the entries but everybody who owns the cryptocurrency gets to play an active role in the upkeep and fidelity of the account book.

Why Was The Blockchain Created?

Any cryptocurrency is a digital token. That is, say you own 10 Bitcoins, you don’t actually hold them in your hands. Your crypto assets will exist as lines of code on a computer and any transaction you make will have to be digitally executed and verified.

Now, to have a purely digital currency, which exists only as code, can be more complicated than physical money. That is because with physical money, if you have a Rs 10 note and you gave it to a shopkeeper to buy a pen, you will not be able to use the same note again because you have lost, or exchanged, custody of the Rs 10 note for the item you bought. However, with a digital currency there is a problem that the same line of code, which represents a set monetary value, can be sent to multiple people. How would they know that one hasn’t already spent the money that is being offered afresh?

You can point out that when we spend money online, even if the transaction is digital, we do not manage to spend the same funds twice. That is because, the wallet or account that is being used for online transactions is monitored by a third-party — the bank or the payment service provider — which keeps tabs on how much money you hold in the account and how much you have spent.

But Bitcoin, and the other cryptocurrencies that have followed in its wake, were created to be decentralised currencies, that is, ones that wouldn’t need a bank or a third-party monitor to verify transactions. The blockchain, then, was the key tech proposed by the creator, or creators, of Bitcoin to solve the problem of not having a central authority to oversee transactions.

How Does The Blockchain Work?

In a 2008 white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or group of people who led the creation of Bitcoin, said, “We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.""

That, in a nutshell, is the basic idea behind blockchain with, of course, a statement of the other technicalities that go into making the system a robust online account book. Since there is no central authotrity keeping a tab on transactions, the blockchain is said to represent what is called a “decentralised ledger"".

The creators of Bitcoin had noted that to remove the role of a trusted third-party, “what is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other"". But there was the ‘double-spend’ problem and, to counter it, the creators proposed “a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions"". Sounds like complicated code, but what it lays out is the philosophy of the blockchain.

The Bitcoin paper assumes, simply enough, that to be able to detect any case of ‘double-spend’, a user must be aware of any previous transactions made with the same coin, or code, since it’s digital money we’re talking about.

“The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions… To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced, and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received,"" the paper said. Accomplish this and, voila, you have your peer-to-peer, decentralised, and secure, cryptocurrency.

How Does Bitcoin Use Its Blockchain?

So, first, when a transaction is made using Bitcoin, it is broadcast to all the nodes, which is nothing but Bitcoin parlance for any computer that any user uses to access her Bitcoins. What happens after the details of a transaction is shared with all the nodes is that each node bunches them into a block. So far so good. But what prevents a node to broadcast a fraudulent transaction and getting it uploaded? To counter this, Bitcoin has an elaborate ‘proof-of-work"" and ‘consensus’ mechanism.

What ‘proof-of-work’ involves is the nodes getting down to solving a complex algorithm — once a block has been created — that would generate a key to add the transaction to the chain of all preceding transactions. But solving the algorithm is a task that requires massive computational power, something that yields Bitcoin — the so-called mining — and also ensures the integrity and security of the distributed ledger.

“When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes. Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent,"" the Bitcoin paper says, describing how a block is added to the chain. Now comes the part about why it’s so tough to tamper with the Bitcoin ledger.

Since the nodes in the Bitcoin system have to accept the transactions in a block, there is a majority decision system involved here. That is, 51 per cent of all the computing power in the Bitcoin network would have to okay a block for it to be added to the blockchain. The Bitcoin paper says that “the majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it"".

“If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes,"" given the computational power required to verify and add one block, this is something that Bitcoin users believe can never happen.

Unless, one group controls 51 per cent of the computational power. Then it can force the other users to accept whatever transactions it clears. But the Bitcoin paper notes that transactions will be “computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power"".

What Other Uses Can It Have?

From maintaining databases of land records to facilitating voting at elections, the use of blockchain tech is being explored in multiple sectors. IBM is said to have devised a logistics tracker for food based on blockchain while the tech is being developed for sectors like banking, healthcare, etc. “Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved,"" IBM says. Within the crypto-verse itself, the blockchain is now used to also support the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a new digital asset category that allows users to digitally mint artwork, etc. and trade those as signature property.

Coming back to real-world uses, tampering of documents and records and vote manipulation are issues that a blockchain-based system can address given that there is no central authority or central database that manipulators can hack.

In its draft ‘National Strategy on Blockchain‘, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) said that blockchain is “an apt technology for applying to resolve shortcomings of any property record management system. Immutability in Blockchain can provide an assurance to citizens that their property records are never tampered"".

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has also reportedly directed the setting up of a blockchain system to track aspects related to the stock market.

But that’s not to say that the blockchain does not have its drawbacks, the chief among which is the huge requirement of energy to run the system. The cracking of the algorithm that enables the addition of a block to the chain requires users to devote massive computational power. When it comes to Bitcoin, the spending of so much energy is rewarded with the cryptocurrency, but it is one aspect of the system that has been flagged as not being environmentally sustainable.

2021-08-16,Yahoo Finance,This Company Lets You Buy A Tesla With Dogecoin And Other Cryptocurrencies,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/company-lets-buy-tesla-dogecoin-000055624.html,"Puerto Rican technology company Bots Inc (OTCMKTS: BTZI) is making Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) a payment option for buying pre-owned Teslas.

What Happened: According to the company's press release, it has enabled local car dealerships to start accepting DOGE and other cryptocurrencies as payment.

Bots said it moved to offer Dogecoin merchant services after seeing demand from car dealers and manufacturers.

Why It Matters: After the crypto boom in 2020, dealerships reportedly recognized that the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Dogecoin was an opportunity to reach new customers.

What’s more, the price of used cars has rapidly increased over the same period, driven by the global shortage in microchips forcing cutbacks in production.

For instance, automotive research site iSeeCars.com found that an average new Model 3 sells for $44,409, while a lightly used version is listed for $45,677.

“Buyers are willing to pay extra for a used Tesla Model 3 because the Model 3 is still relatively uncommon in the used car marketplace. And despite the high resale value of its used versions, it is the most affordable Tesla available,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer to the Observer.

What Else: Last month, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk hinted that the company could soon resume accepting Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles.

“I want to do a little more diligence to confirm that the percentage of renewable energy usage is most likely at or above 50% and that there is a trend towards increasing that number. If so, Tesla will resume accepting Bitcoin,” he said.

For now, however, used cars dealers that opt to provide their customers with the option of using crypto to make purchases can do so with Bots’ merchant services.

Price Action: At press time, Dogecoin was trading at $0.2984, down 6.39% over the past 24-hours.

2021-08-16,The Economic Times,Beyond Bitcoins: Investors make big bets in altcoins,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/beyond-bitcoins-investors-make-big-bets-in-altcoins/articleshow/85398742.cms,"Cryptocurrencies have made a sharp comeback, with top-notch tokens leading the way. However, alternative coins have outperformed leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past one week, thanks to a catch-up rally.Edul Patel, CEO & co-founder, Mudrex , said the rally in altcoins has reduced the dominance of Bitcoin, whose market cap was now at 45 per cent of the total crypto market cap. “If we look at an indicator called the Money Flow Index, we see that the volume and money flow into most of the top altcoins has gone significantly up. It is because of the growth potential of these smaller altcoins.”After the London Hard Fork update, there was a rally in Bitcoin and Ethereum, leading to a breakout for the entire market following a prolonged consolidation. The major digital currencies have gained 9-12 per cent in the past week.On the other hand, altcoins such as IoTeX have rallied over 320 per cent in the last seven days. Revain and Terra have soared 78 per cent and 62 per cent, respectively. Among the popular names, Solana, Axie Infinity, Cadano, XRP and Dogecoin have jumped 40-65 per cent during the period.Sharan Nair, Chief Business Officer at CoinSwitch Kuber , said cryptocurrencies were still at a nascent stage. There was still a huge potential for new entrant coins to make an impact. ""Most investors are on the lookout for new coins that they believe will radically change the ecosystem and they want to invest in them at early stages and benefit from it, like what investors did in bitcoin and ether,"" he added.Investors who flock to cryptocurrencies for attractive returns said crypto behemoths like Bitcoin and Ethereum do not have much steam left. This has made many altcoins scale higher in the market cap chart. ""Adoption leads to demand, which drives prices significantly higher,"" said Patel. ""In the coming months, we would see these smaller altcoins gain adoption as well as market capitalisation.""For example, Binance Coin and Cardano are now the third and fourth largest cryptocurrencies, respectively. Similarly, Solana is now on the verge of entering the top 10 table. Axie Infinity has joined the top 35. ""The market seems to be bullish and, in general, we have seen such a market bringing in new crypto investors, many of whom try to invest more in new coins,"" said Nair.Market watchers said investors were now more inclined towards altcoins, instead of mainstream tokens, as they were aiming to make an early entry into new crypto projects with promise and potential. “The new projects are undervalued and once its potential is exposed, it will draw a lot of traction and will lead to an increase in price,” Nair of CoinSwitchKuber said.Analysts suggested that investors were not willing to put all their eggs in one basket. Prudent investors prefer to diversify their portfolios.Several retail investors come to the crypto markets to make quick gains and only invest in the smaller altcoins, many of which often nosedive.Some of the smaller altcoins have exciting prospects as they gain adoption from institutional investors and retail investors, said Patel. ""The bulk of the investments would still flow into the mainstream tokens instead of smaller altcoins,"" he added.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85399014,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-67542,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-16,Politico,‘Massive wake-up call’: Crypto faces growing legal crackdown,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/17/cryptocurrency-legal-crackdown-505595,"""This should serve as a massive wake-up call to the crypto industry,"" said Charley Cooper, a former CFTC chief operating officer now with software and blockchain technology firm R3. ""A policy or a posture of ignoring Washington or showing disdain for Washington ... will ultimately be a failed strategy.""

The enforcement actions are fueling debate about how cryptocurrency players fit into financial regulations. Federal regulators say the new digital currency platforms must adhere to existing rules, but industry players counter that it's not that simple and that it's time for Congress to pass new laws that are more tailored to crypto.

""This regulation by enforcement that we're seeing is not the way to go because it doesn't create good policy,"" said Kristin Smith, who advocates for the cryptocurrency industry as executive director of the Blockchain Association. ""Regulators — in particular the SEC — think that the laws and regulations are crystal clear and that they're very easy to interpret. But for those of us on the other side of the table that are working in the industry and its ecosystem, the laws aren't clear, and it's very difficult to figure out how to apply them.""

The market value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies hit $2 trillion again this week, meaning the stakes have never been higher for companies looking to enter the space. The movement has also spawned a whole sector of decentralized finance applications — so-called DeFi apps — that offer automated, autonomous trading and lending services with minimal human interaction. One such DeFi service, Poly Network, disclosed losing $600 million in a breach earlier this month.

Regulators in recent weeks have made clear they’re zeroing in on crypto exchanges and DeFi platforms.

Two high profile cases in August — a $100 million CFTC and Treasury settlement with crypto derivatives service BitMEX and a $10 million SEC settlement with digital asset exchange Poloniex — revolved around charges that the companies were operating unlicensed trading platforms. Another SEC settlement this month with decentralized lender DeFi Money Market accused its backers of selling more than $30 million in unregistered securities using so-called smart contracts and DeFi technology.

Some of the targeted crypto companies are trying to signal that they now take the rules more seriously. BitMEX CEO Alexander Höptner said in a blog post after his exchange's settlement that ""crypto is becoming more responsible.""

""We are committed to becoming a regulated exchange and are looking to set the benchmarks in this new era for crypto,"" said George Godsal, spokesperson for BitMEX operator 100x.

The federal cases came as five states including New Jersey, Texas and Kentucky took action against the startup BlockFi for offering interest-earning accounts that regulators say could be unregistered securities products.

BlockFi spokesperson Madelyn McHugh said the company believes its products and services are lawful and appropriate for crypto market participants, and that ""we remain steadfast in our commitment to protect consumers’ rights to earn interest on their crypto assets.""

""We’re hopeful that BlockFi will lead the charge in collaborating with regulators to define a regulatory path for our ecosystem going forward,"" McHugh said.

Lawyers tracking the cases said they showed that, even though some digital assets businesses assert certain laws don't apply to them, that doesn't stop the government from taking action.

""We've all been telling our clients and we've been telling people publicly for years that just because you come up with some name for something doesn't mean that the laws don't apply,"" said Stephen Palley, partner at the law firm Anderson Kill.

Vincent McGonagle, the CFTC's acting enforcement director, said in a statement that ""there is a strong need for regulatory compliance in the digital asset market space and for bad actors to be identified and held accountable.""

""The CFTC will continue to use the tools available to us to the fullest extent possible to closely monitor these evolving markets,"" McGonagle said. ""The recent resolution with BitMEX and other enforcement actions by the commission, including those in the spot markets for digital assets, reflect our strong commitment to aggressively pursue actionable conduct within our jurisdiction.""

Davis Polk partner Robert Cohen, former chief of the SEC's cyber unit, said that agency has taken an active approach to crypto enforcement since 2017, and it's no surprise it's continued under the Biden administration.

One of Trump-era SEC Chair Jay Clayton's final actions at the helm of the agency last December was to sue financial technology startup Ripple for allegedly selling unregistered securities in the form of the XRP cryptocurrency. The move triggered litigation between the SEC and Ripple that continues to this day over the extent to which digital currency should be regulated as an investment product.

""A question going forward is whether there will be progress on rulemaking and guidance for the community that provides the clarity and certainty needed to operate within the SEC’s regulatory system,"" Cohen said.

Some lawmakers are beginning to push back on the enforcement crackdown and warn there is an urgent need for Congress to draft new rules for the industry's business model.

Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, said ""regulation through enforcement hinders innovation.""

""It's creating uncertainty in a really important and growing industry in the United States and globally,” McHenry said in an interview. “If we don't bring regulatory clarity here in this space, it's going to go to other regimes around the world that are more conducive for its development.""

Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) has introduced legislation that would require the CFTC and SEC to issue new cryptocurrency rules. His bill would give the CFTC — which today regulates derivatives linked to things like oil and also fiat currencies — authority over digital assets. It would give the SEC — the U.S. stock market regulator — authority over digital asset securities.

McHenry has also proposed a bill that would convene a working group between the SEC, CFTC and industry to report on cryptocurrency regulation.

""The lack of legal clarity has hindered investment and innovation, and Congress should provide clear rules of the road for this growing market,"" Beyer said in a statement.

Gensler, who has been leading efforts to rein in crypto as SEC chair, said this month that his agency needs additional authorities to prevent transactions, products and platforms from falling between the regulatory cracks.

""Right now we are turning to the courts to settle our disputes, which is not necessarily a bad thing — that's why they're there,"" said Joseph Rotunda, director of the enforcement division at the Texas State Securities Board. ""But that also provides a lack of certainty.""","('https://static.politico.com/9a/89/4daef56d44839198f6d3288dc110/210817-cryptocurrency-wallet-ap-773.jpg',)",none
2021-08-16,CNBC,Want to put bitcoin in your IRA? Why experts say you may want to rethink that,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/why-experts-say-cryptocurrencies-are-not-the-best-fit-for-iras.html,"In this article ROST

The entire cryptocurrency market climbed to more than $2 trillion over the weekend for the first time since mid-May. Bitcoin, one of the more popular digital offerings, also surged to more than $48,000, though it has already lost some of those gains. If you're like many investors, you may be wondering how you can get in on the action. That could include your retirement savings vehicles, such as individual retirement accounts.

Crypto is a 24/7, 365 market, so you can't just leave it to chance like every other asset. Tyrone Ross Jr. CEO of Onramp Invest

But both bullish and bearish experts on cryptocurrencies say it's still too early to store those assets in retirement accounts. Tyrone Ross Jr., CEO of Onramp Invest, a provider of a crypto asset integration platform for financial advisors, is one of them. That's despite admitting he owns a ""whole lot"" of cryptocurrencies in his own portfolio. Ross compares using cryptocurrencies in a retirement account to taking a beautiful, exotic animal outside of its natural habitat and putting it in a zoo. Instead, it should be free, open and borderless, he said.

""As you start to understand it and all the things you can do with it, you would not put it in some of those accounts,"" Ross said. One reason: Because of how the accounts are structured, the average investor will not be able to hold the keys to their cryptocurrency investment, which is essential for managing their money. Without that, it's just buy and hold, Ross said. Efforts are underway to eliminate that, he said. Still, other concerns are keeping experts from wholeheartedly recommending cryptocurrencies for retirement accounts.

More vigilance

Meanwhile, financial advisors who work with clients who want to add cryptocurrencies to their accounts need to make sure clients are prepared to take on the higher risks associated with those investments. They also need to be prepared to update clients on those investments more frequently than once per quarter as with other holdings such as stocks and bonds. ""You should be talking to clients every month about their crypto,"" Ross said. Investors who instead turn to so-called self-directed IRAs can add those investments without an advisor's help. Yet that will still require more vigilance. ""Crypto is a 24/7, 365 market, so you can't just leave it to chance like every other asset,"" Ross said.

Regulatory risks

Traditional IRA custodians do not currently permit cryptocurrencies in their IRAs. However, self-directed IRAs can. And with that freedom comes risks. ""These self-directed IRA custodians will put in anything you want that's legal, but they're not the police,"" said Ed Slott, CPA and founder of Ed Slott and Co. ""They're not going to tell you what's good or bad or advise."" Currently, these asset classes are not permitted in IRAs: life insurance and collectibles. Part of the problem with those items is the valuations are subjective, such as with a piece of art work.

Other investments that have been cleared for IRAs, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, have a stated market value, Slott said. The known value is important because those assets are taxed when taken out of an IRA. But with cryptocurrencies, the expected value is not clear, Slott said. What makes cryptocurrencies difficult to use is that they are not a regulated product at this point, said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. Meanwhile, IRA accounts tend to be among the most highly regulated, which is why many IRA account administrators will not allow clients to put cryptocurrencies in their accounts, he said. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler recently said the agency needs Congress to increase its ability to oversee cryptocurrencies. In the meantime, the lack of regulation can pose a problem for advisors. ""If you're working with a client and all of a sudden this goes vamoose, what do you say?"" Ross said.

If you still want to invest

When deciding where to put your money, one thing to remember is the purpose of the account you're using to invest, Kinahan said. For IRAs, typically that purpose is not to lose money. ""Particularly when it comes to your retirement, you want to make sure that the money you sweat out to earn is at that same level or hopefully significantly higher when you retire,"" Kinahan said. As such, separate margin or trading accounts that are not dedicated to retirement may be a better place to add riskier assets. If you still are convinced you want cryptocurrencies in your IRA, limit your exposure to 5%, Slott said. ""You get a taste of it in there,"" Slott said. ""If it goes up, that's great. ""If you lose your money, it's not the worst thing in the world, because it's a very small percentage of your retirement portfolio.""

The volatility, I think, is too much for somebody approaching retirement or already there. Ed Slott CPA and founder, Ed Slott and Co.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106714925-1600919715376-gettyimages-1142134773-1dx_1772.jpeg?v=1629214427',)",none
2021-08-16,Cointelegraph,Cryptocurrency derivatives market shows growth despite regulatory FUD,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-derivatives-market-shows-growth-despite-regulatory-fud,"The cryptocurrency market has successfully rebounded from the two-month slump it had gone into from late May to the end of July. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have been leading the charge, posting impressive gains over the last two weeks. The market is seeing price levels that it had reached back in May of this year.

Along with the price gains, the cryptocurrency derivatives market that includes financial instruments like futures, options and even micro futures are also seeing rejuvenated interest from investors. According to data from Bybt, The open interest (OI) in Bitcoin options across all the global exchanges offering the product has more than doubled from the yearly low of $3.63 billion on June 26, hitting a 90 day high of $7.86 billion on Aug. 14.

Cointelegraph discussed this spike in OI with Shane Ai, head of product R&D at Bybit, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, who said: “The rise in Option OI is mostly driven by institutional players, and the rising popularity of third-party OTC platforms has facilitated easier execution of multi-legged strategies with deeper liquidity — which are prerequisites for more institutional participation.” Data from on-chain analytics provider CryptoQuant also reveals that institutions are buying BTC in the same manner as they did back in late 2020.

A similar spike in growth is seen in the metrics of the Ether options market as well. The OI in Ether Options jumped 75% from $2.42 billion on 30 July to hit a two-month high of $4.26 billion on Aug. 14. This puts the year-on-year (YoY) growth for this market at 846%.

Notably, the crypto derivatives market is still in the nascent stages of its development, as it only sprung into existence in Q2 2020. Even global investment banking giant Goldman Sachs announced their plans earlier in June to expand its foray into the cryptocurrency markets with Ether options.

CME data reveals strong growth in 2021

The growth is seen even in the crypto derivatives products offered by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the world’s largest derivatives exchange. CME is often considered to be a benchmark for institutional interest. Currently, they have four crypto derivatives offerings, Bitcoin Futures, Ether Futures, Micro Bitcoin Futures and Bitcoin Options.

According to the data provided by CME, as of Aug. 11, the average daily volume (ADV) in their Bitcoin futures has grown nearly 30% from 8,231 contracts year to date in 2020 to 10,667 contracts year to date in 2021. In the same duration, the open interest for these futures grew by 18.6% to 8,988 contracts year to date in 2021.

While CME has been offering their BTC futures and options since 2017 and 2020, respectively, the exchange launched both their Ether futures and Micro BTC futures earlier this year in February and May.

Since their launch on Feb. 8, CME Ether futures have had an ADV of 2,864 contracts with open interest averaging at 2,436 contracts. A record volume of 11,980 contracts was traded on May 19, and a record OI of 3,977 contracts on June 1.

In the case of CME Micro BTC Futures, they have had an ADV of 21,667 contracts with their OI averaging at 19,990 contracts. This product is designed to enable even retail investors to manage their Bitcoin price risk. Its size is 1/10th that of a Bitcoin and has traded 1.5 million contracts since the launch. An all-time high of 94,770 contracts was traded on May 19 with a record open interest of 38,073 contracts being attained on June 1.

Cointelegraph discussed this growth in the markets with Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of crypto derivatives exchange, Deribit who stated:

“We have seen incredible growth in Q1 and Q2 this year showing the potential of derivatives and, in our case specifically, options driven by ever-increasing client demand. We expect this trend to continue as we are onboarding an increasing number of (institutional) clients.”

Organic growth supported by ETH activity

Strijers added that the spike in OI in August was not only due to the rise in price leading to the notional value growing but also due to the expansion of the number of open contracts after the large Q2 expiry for BTC options.

This reveals that the OI growth that the market is currently undergoing is organic and not just a by-product of the notional value rising. He mentioned that this effect was even larger for Ether, adding:

“The latter is explained by the launch of EIP-1559 and the consequence that nearly $100m worth of ETH has been burned since the upgrade. Furthermore, the NFT hype results in a lot of people buying NFTs, using their ETH and buying upside calls instead to avoid missing out on the potential upside.”

The Ethereum network finally underwent the London upgrade on Aug. 5 which ushered in the much anticipated Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 that changes the transaction pricing mechanism for the network and the management of the fees. Strijers opined on how the London hard fork impacted the upwind for ETH, saying, “The market seems to appreciate the London fork changes. A lot of ETH was already locked in smart contracts or staked, and now the supply is getting even more scarce due to the gas burn mechanism, driving prices upwards.”

Ai mentioned more on the specific impact of the hard fork on the ETH derivatives market, saying that the ETH IV term structure has gone into contango (a scenario where the futures price of the asset is higher than the spot price), alongside steeper call-put skews as trends further in time are observed. Steeper skews could often indicate higher prices for Out of the Money (OTM) put options and lower prices for OTM call options.

Several players in the industry are innovating with automated solutions to simplify Bitcoin options trading for retail investors. Delta exchange, a crypto derivatives platform, recently launched automated trading under the product name “Enhanced Yield” for BTC, ETH and Tether (USDT).

Regulators frown on derivatives trading

Despite the immense growth of the crypto derivatives market, or rather because of it, regulatory authorities are often known to be skeptical of the sector. In the recent past, various organizations have extended their cautionary warnings to curbing actions for players offering these financial instruments in the market.

In a very public settlement, BitMEX has agreed to pay $100 million to the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to put a case filed in the U.S. District Court on Oct. 1, 2020, to rest. The CFTC charged BitMEX owners with “illegally operating a cryptocurrency derivatives platform” and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations.

In another instance of regulatory bodies increasing their scrutiny on the derivatives trading sub-ecosystem, global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced that they will be shutting down derivatives trading in the European region, beginning with Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. In addition to the EU region, Binance has also announced that they would be restricting access to derivatives products for its users in Hong Kong. CEO Changpeng Zhao mentioned that it was a measure to establish “crypto compliance best practices worldwide.”

Early in January this year, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) banned crypto exchanges from selling crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail consumers. The regulatory authority cited the reason for this ban as that these products are “ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose.”

Despite regulatory organizations cracking down on crypto derivatives, the futures and options markets have continued to show immense growth this year. A report by Inca Digital revealed that hundreds of traders in the U.S. are evading local regulations and trading crypto derivative assets on exchanges like FTX and Binance. These platforms have official U.S. counterparts that don’t offer derivatives products on their platform due to regulatory concerns.

However, Brett Harrison, president of FTX.US, the U.S. counterpart of FTX, recently stated that the platform aims to offer crypto derivatives trading in the U.S. in less than a year. Harrison also mentioned that as institutional investors are responsible for nearly 70% of the trading volume of FTX.US, their current aim is to grow their retail base in the country.

This reasoning could be the driving force behind the exchange’s recent decision to hire Kevin O’Leary — aka Mr. Wonderful of Shark Tank fame — as the brand ambassador and official spokesperson for FTX.

While that could be pure conjecture, the growth of the crypto derivatives market is undeniable and inevitable in the future as the liquidity improves. These instruments that provide hedging and risk solutions are much needed by investors, especially in these times of high volatility.","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDgvNmM2NGEwNWUtOGEyOC00MTZmLWEyYWQtYmY2ZDNlZjMzOWY2LmpwZw==.jpg',)",none
2021-08-16,Zee News,Cryptocurrency Bill: Will it become asset class or face ban in India?,https://zeenews.india.com/technology/cryptocurrency-bill-will-it-become-asset-class-or-face-ban-in-india-2385943.html,"The Union Cabinet will soon take up the cryptocurrency bill, which seeks to regulate virtual currency in India. Headed by the secretary(economic affairs), a high-level committee has been formed and it has already submitted its report on cryptocurrency.

Earlier, the central government had formed the panel to study the issues related to digital currencies and propose specific actions regarding the crypto coins. “Cabinet note is ready on cryptocurrency (bill). I am awaiting Cabinet to clear that,"" finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday.

The inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Economic Affairs) to study the issues related to virtual currencies and propose specific actions has already submitted its report.

It has recommended that all private cryptocurrencies, except any virtual currencies issued by state, will be prohibited in India.

""Cabinet note is ready on cryptocurrency (Bill). I am awaiting Cabinet to clear that,"" she said during her interaction with the media here.

Meanwhile, the RBI has concerns on the cryptocurrencies traded in the market and has conveyed the same to the government.

Back in May this year, the finance minister had said that a very calibrated position is supposed to be taken on crypto and digital currency as the world is rapidly transitioning towards technology. Other media reports suggested that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be allowed as an asset class in India.

Underlining that both the government and the RBI are ""committed to financial stability"", RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said there are no differences between the central bank and the Finance Ministry on the matter, and ""we should now await the final decision on the matter"" from the Centre.

Das had said he has ""reasons to believe"" that the government is in agreement with the ""major concerns"" flagged by the RBI about the cryptocurrencies.

The Supreme Court in March allowed banks and financial institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrencies by setting aside the RBI's 2018 circular which had prohibited them.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of their units and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

A three-judge bench, headed by Justice R F Nariman, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular is liable to be set aside on the ground of ""proportionality"".

""Accordingly, the writ petitions are allowed and the circular dated April 6, 2018 is set aside,"" said the bench, also comprising justices Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian.","('https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2021/08/17/961680-crypto-1.jpg',)",none

It has managed to break past its peak of mid-May and has a market cap of more than $20 billion.Meanwhile, Terra's token, called Luna ($LUNA), is also up by almost 40% and priced at a little more than $26.Both the DeFi projects have witnessed trading volume rise by a whopping 50%.

2021-08-16,CNBC,Crypto platform hit by $600 million heist asks hacker to become its chief security advisor,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/poly-network-cryptocurrency-hack-latest.html,"The Poly Network logo displayed on a phone screen with a physical representation of some cryptocurrencies. Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto via Getty Images

The cryptocurrency platform targeted in a massive heist is now inviting the hacker behind it to become an advisor to the firm, and promising a $500,000 reward for the restoration of user funds. Poly Network, a so-called decentralized finance or ""DeFi"" project, was hit with a major attack last week which saw the hacker, or hackers, make off with more than $600 million worth of tokens. Poly Network lets users swap tokens from one digital ledger to another. Someone exploited a flaw in Poly Network's code which allowed them to transfer the assets to their own crypto wallets. It is thought to be the largest crypto heist of all time, surpassing the $534.8 million in digital coins stolen from Japanese exchange Coincheck in a 2018 attack and the estimated $450 million worth of bitcoin that went missing from Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox in 2014. In Poly Network's case, the hacker has taken the unusual step of returning most of the stolen money. All but $33 million of the crypto has now been returned.

However, more than $200 million of the funds is currently locked in an account that requires passwords from Poly Network and the hacker to gain access. Poly Network has pleaded with the hacker, who it is calling ""Mr. White Hat,"" to provide the password — known as a ""private key"" — necessary to retrieve the money. ""Mr. White Hat"" is a reference to ethical hackers who search for vulnerabilities in organizations' systems that could expose them to attacks. Security researchers have questioned the labeling of the Poly Network attacker as a white hat hacker. It's not clear why the hacker is withholding access to the final tranche of assets. An anonymous person claiming to be the hacker has simply said they will provide the key once ""everyone is ready."" Last week, it was revealed that Poly Network had offered a $500,000 ""bug bounty"" to send all of the money back. Such bounties are typically rewarded to people who report bugs to help companies find and resolve flaws before they are disclosed to the general public. The hacker initially turned down the bounty offer. However, in a message embedded in a digital currency transaction Monday, the hacker said ""I am considering taking the bounty as a bonus for public hackers if they can hack the Poly Network.""

Poly Network said Tuesday that it hoped to implement a ""significant system upgrade"" to prevent such an attack from happening again in future, but that it couldn't do so until all the remaining assets are returned. The group said its promise to reward ""Mr. White Hat"" with a $500,000 bounty still stands, and even invited the hacker to becomes its ""chief security advisor.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106926569-1628840500054-gettyimages-1234636357-porzycki-polynetw210812_npiTb.jpeg?v=1628840629',)",none

His tweet comes after the billionaire entrepreneur, Shark Tank star, and the owner of Dallas Mavericks Mark Cuban called the meme coin the strongest medium of exchange in the cryptocurrency world. Cuban has been known as a fan of Dogecoin and he often shows his support on Twitter. But nothing can surpass the Tesla and SpaceX CEO's enthusiasm for the virtual currency. Musk agreed with Cuban's views. Replying to CNBC's tweet stating, ""Mark Cuban says Dogecoin is the 'strongest' cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange,"" Musk tweeted, ""I've been saying this for a while."" His point is made. No one can deter Mr. Musk anymore.

Musk's tweet has received over 26,000 likes and 4,000 retweets within four days. Policy strategist and entrepreneur Erich Reimer replied to him with just one word, Should we take it as his support for Dogecoin? Perhaps we should.

Dogecoin supporters seem to have been torn about the decision to support or shun the cryptocurrency lately. A lot of them have been quite distressed about its performance — and that of the cryptocurrency market — over the last many weeks. As it still continues to go through a low phase, supporters often muse over the future implications of their investments. However, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO continues to actively support it with tweets and memes — not to forget his SNL appearance as 'Dogefather'.

2021-08-16,Business Standard,Cardano's ADA token is now world's third-largest cryptocurrency,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/cardano-s-ada-token-is-now-world-s-third-largest-cryptocurrency-121081700976_1.html,"A little-known digital token linked to the Cardano blockchain has just become the third-largest virtual currency in the world as network developers look to ride the boom in decentralized finance.

With the so-called ADA jumping around 50% over the past week alone, optimism is rising that new technological enhancements will allow smart contracts on Cardano by its announced goal of Sept. 12. That will enable its network to offer lucrative services like DeFi, where Ethereum currently dominates.

In a rally met with skepticism by some big industry names, the ADA token now has a market value of more than $69 billion -- bigger than all rivals except and Ether, according to tracker CoinGecko.

“The Cardano aficionados have been awaiting -- some impatiently -- for what seems like an eternity for some news on smart contracts,” said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner and co-founder of crypto lender Nexo. “Cardano is tussling with no. 2 crypto Ethereum to be the preeminent blockchain offering smart contracts.”

The more than 1,400% jump in ADA over the past year exceeds the returns from both and Ether.

The virtual coin has climbed despite skepticism about its utility from some prominent commentators. For instance, Galaxy Digital LP Chief Executive Officer Mike Novogratz posted on Twitter on Sunday that “I spoke to twenty of the smartest people I know in the space, and zero of them saw Cardano having traction” with developers.





“Most people outside crypto have never even heard of Cardano -- yet here it is with a market cap” that tops many S&P 500 index constituents, Trenchev said.

Decentralized finance -- or DeFi -- ports financial functions onto digital ledgers, allowing people to do things like lend or borrow funds and earn interest in a savings-like account without the need for traditional intermediaries such as banks. Its growing popularity is part of a wider trend of increased blockchain usage.

Recent rallies in Bitcoin, Ether, ADA and other tokens helped the market vault past $2 trillion in value over the weekend for the first time since May, when the famously volatile sector succumbed to a rout.","('https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2021-08/17/full/1629200640-3825.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrency prices have fallen over the past 24 hours as the virtual coin market saw minor consolidation. Almost all cryptocurrencies have seen a fall in prices as the ongoing rally seems to be fading.

Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, was hovering around $46,000, down over 1.2 per cent at 4:30 pm. Bitcoin’s market capitalisation also fell marginally to $880 billion.

Ether price also fell over 1.4 per cent to $3,244. The second most popular cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation fell to $379 billion.

The value of most other altcoins fell including XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Stellar, Uniswap, Chainlink and Litecoin. Only Solana performed well, rising approximately 14 per cent.

Commenting on the consolidation, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The past 24 hours witnessed Bitcoin and Ether toying with their crucial support and resistance levels. BTC hovered around the $46,000 level, and Ether fell below $3200 before settling.”

“Following this, we saw the crypto markets facing a minor consolidation. Among the Altcoins, the star performer of the day was Solana which shot up another 14 per cent,” he added.

“As the top cryptos are losing the steam and consolidating, we might witness another season for the Altcoins after the rally earlier this year.”

India is racing to keep up with the cryptocurrency craze in the country. India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated that the new regulations around cryptocurrencies in India — the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019 — are waiting on approval from the Cabinet before it can be introduced into the Parliament. She had stated this earlier as well, ahead of the Monsoon Session in July this year.The Union Cabinet is India’s highest decision-making body. Only the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and other ministers of rank are a part of the Cabinet. The supreme body needs to give the green light before the new laws can be introduced for debate in Parliament.Those in the know, requesting to remain anonymous, told Business Insider that the government is most likely mulling over a softer stance given the recent surge in crypto adoption and awareness within the country.This means that it's possible that the Cabinet will not approve the bill in its current form, as seen in the draft ahead of the Budget Session of Parliament in February.The massive surge in Bitcoin’s price earlier this year, coupled with high inflation , has led young investors to invest in cryptocurrencies as an alternative financial instrument, despite their reputation for being heavily volatile.This is partly due toexchanges like WazirX, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber, and others garnering new funding. And that funding is going towards heavy-weight sponsorships in the mainstream — like the Euro Cup and the T20 cricket tournament between Sri Lanka and India — which is driving awareness among the masses.If the bill is rejected by the Cabinet, then it’s possible that things will have to start from scratch all over again, especially if the Indian government is looking to take a softer approach to cryptocurrencies.“The government seems to be still in the process of determining the way forward, which may through either an existing committee or a new one with industry consultation where required,"" Rameesh Kailasam, the CEO of IndiaTech, told Business Insider in an earlier interview The way the passing of a bill works in India is that a committee is assigned to draft the bill. The committee is headed by one, or in this case, multiple ministries.Given the vast application of cryptocurrencies — even though the Ministry of Finance’s Department of Economic Affairs is leading the charge — other stakeholders like the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and the Reserve Bank of India also are a part of the process.Once the committee has drafted the bill, it then needs to be approved by the Finance Ministry. Once they approve it, it goes over to the Ministry of Law for another layer of endorsement to ensure it ticks all the boxes and doesn’t include any language that could get the government into trouble.Only once the bill has cleared both those thresholds does it make its way to the Cabinet. The ministers then discuss the bill to ascertain if any changes are required. If they feel the bill isn’t up to the mark, it will be sent back to the Finance Ministry.If not, the bill is presented to the public for comments before being introduced into the lower house of Parliament, the Lok Sabha. They then have three readings of the bill before it is passed to the upper house, the Rajya Sabha.Even then, the bill nevertheless needs approval from the President before it is eligible to come into effect.Depending on the changes suggested, it’s possible that the bill may not clear the Cabinet approval stage of the process. They could request for the Finance Ministry and other stakeholders to form an entirely new committee to draft a new version of the bill. They could even ask for a change at the helm with a department other than the Department of Economic Affairs — that, however, is unlikely.“The government seems to be looking at this afresh considering that there needs to be a different take on how to regulate cryptocurrencies rather than push for an outright ban” said Kailasam.The original committee that drafted India’s crypto bill was headed by Finance Secretary Subash Chandra Garg. Other members included MeitY Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney, SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi, and RBI Deputy Governor BP Kanungo.The version of the crypto bill proposed by them, the draft of which was released ahead of the Budget Session of Parliament in February, bans all ‘private’ cryptocurrencies and lays out a plan for India’s apex banking institution to launch its central bank digital currency (CBDC).The definition of ‘private’ cryptocurrencies was however ambiguous. Most speculate, as per the comments of RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, that this covers all cryptocurrencies traded on exchanges including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and others.This, however, does not mean that the central bank is proposing to ban the underlying blockchain platforms. One can ban Ether but the Ethereum blockchain, which facilitates the implementation of smart contracts, does not necessarily have to be pulled down.But, if the government is looking to take a softer stance, in line with the Supreme Court’s judgement in 2020 that abolished the RBI’s ban on cryptocurrencies, a new bill will likely have to be drafted. And, that process will again take its own sweet time cutting through the red tape.This means, just because the crypto bill is awaiting approval from the Cabinet, that it’s a done deal — especially as more and more Indian citizens are investing in cryptocurrency.

A high-level committee headed by the secretary (economic affairs) had already submitted the report on cryptocurrency. The central government had earlier formed the panel to study the issues related to digital currencies and propose specific actions regarding the crypto coins. “Cabinet note is ready on cryptocurrency (bill). I am awaiting Cabinet to clear that,"" finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday.

The proposed bill narrowly missed out on being tabled during the Monsoon Session of the Parliament. Cryptocurrency bill’s key purpose will be the “creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India,"" according to the bulletin for the Budget Session prepared by the Lok Sabha Secretariat. The bill also “seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India"" but it would permit “certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of crytptocurrency and its uses,"" the bulletin mentioned. The inter-ministerial panel has recommended that all private cryptocurrencies, except any virtual currencies issued by state, will be prohibited in India, according to reports.

Blanket Ban or an Asset Class? What Govt Says on Cryptocurrency

Earlier in May, finance minister had said that a very calibrated position will be taken on crypto and digital currency as the world is moving rapidly with technology. There have been reports that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be allowed as an asset class in India.

However the central government will not accept cryptocurrency as legal tender any time soon. The Centra has reiterated time and again that it does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin. During Budget 2018-19, the Union government had said that it will “take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system.”

Reserve Bank of India on Cryptocurrency

In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had “advised all the entities regulated by it not to deal in"" digital currencies. Later in 2020, the Supreme Court set aside the central bank’s 2018 circular and allowed banks and financial institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrencies. RBI had announced in May, 2021 that banks would be permitted to facilitate cryptocurrency trades after Supreme Court ruling.

The RBI has concerns on the cryptocurrencies traded in the market and has conveyed the same to the government. On cryptocurrency, there are no differences between the central bank and the finance ministry, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had maintained. “We should now await the final decision on the matter from the Centre,"" he added.

Crypto Craze in India

Indians have invested around $ 6.6 billion in cryptocurrencies till May 2021, according to an Analytics Insight report. This saw a over 600 per cent jump from $923 million in April 2020. Nearly 1.5 crore Indians are said to have invested in cryptocurrencies. At present, over 350 startups operate in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Considering the huge interest from the investors and rapidly grown cryptocurrency market, the government is taking a cautious approach towards cryptocurrencies.

“We are happy to see that the government is pushing for crypto legislation. However, we don’t know the final elements of the bill and what it entails for the crypto community and companies in India. Emerging technologies like Blockchain and cryptocurrency, AI and ML hold the key for future economic development. With our large tech-savvy populace, we are ideally positioned to embrace, develop and pioneer the tech space,"" said Nischal Shetty, chief executive officer, WazirX.

2021-08-16,The Guardian,Why bitcoin entrepreneurs are flocking to rural Texas,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/17/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-mining-texas,"In the middle of rural Texas, a cryptocurrency mine is currently under construction.

Hundreds of machines more powerful than the average computer will soon be housed in this 320-acre mining facility in Dickens county, where they will work day and night to solve a complex series of algorithms. If successful, the reward will be newly minted bitcoin, currently worth about $44,000 each.

All the machines need to thrive are spaces to sit and electricity – lots of it.

Kevin Brendle, Dickens county’s top elected official, embraced the idea of the mine when Argo Blockchain, a Canadian cryptocurrency mining company, first approached him with the idea of building a facility in the area. Dickens county, population 2,300, “is mostly improved pasture and grassland”, Brendle said.

“It’s wide-open range land, it’s cattle country with a little farming,” he said. “We don’t have a lot of economic development.”

A mine could help stimulate the economy, creating jobs and improving the county’s tax base. And in return, the mine will be powered by some of the cheapest electricity in the world.

To be profitable, mining cryptocurrency requires lots of cheap energy. China was once the main hub for mining, with over half of the world’s mining taking place in the country, precisely because its electricity is cheap. But earlier this summer, local governments in China began to shut down bitcoin mines as the country works to develop its own, better-controlled digital currency. The bitcoin hashrate – the processing power used to produce bitcoin – halved after the crackdown.

Miners have since been scouring the globe for places where electricity is cheap, and many have settled on Texas as their destination.

Texas’s power grid is deregulated, which means customers can choose between different power providers and providers are thus incentivized to provide low rates.

Mining facilities can set up long-term contracts with power providers that allows them to purchase electricity at a fixed price for many years, says Jason Les, CEO of Riot Blockchain, a US-based cryptocurrency mining company.

Riot Blockchain recently acquired Whinstone US, the largest bitcoin mining facility in the US based in Rockdale, Texas, for $80m. Whinstone says its facility can produce 500 bitcoin per month – worth a total of $22m at bitcoin’s current value.

When demand for electricity goes up, particularly in the summer months, Texas power companies will actually pay mining facilities to lower their energy usage.

“If you were a miner that has a long-term power purchase agreement, then you own power at a fixed price … you’re committing to buying energy for years no matter what,” Les said.

“As a bitcoin miner, you essentially own that power, and that allows you to work like a virtual power plant. You can take the power that you agreed to buy at a fixed lower price, and then you can sell that back to the grid.”

In recent months, Texas leaders have been vocal about their support of cryptocurrency mining coming to their state.

In June, Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a bill that puts cryptocurrency under commercial law, making it easier for cryptocurrency businesses to operate in the state. In the same month, Abbott, tweeted: “Texas will be the cryptocurrency leader!” after the Texas grocery chain H-E-B announced that it will be putting cryptocurrency kiosks in some of its stores.

Also making the state attractive to miners is that 20% of its energy comes from wind power, making mining in Texas a much greener alternative than mining in China, where about two-thirds of electricity comes from coal. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, halted his company’s acceptance of bitcoin transactions, citing the “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel”. Musk said that Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin once there’s confirmation that about half of the energy used by miners will be from clean energy.

While states like Kentucky and Louisiana also have cheap power, and others like Wyoming – which recently made it easier for cryptocurrency businesses to become LLCs – have politicians that are cryptocurrency-friendly, Texas is the only state that seems to offer miners the best of both worlds.

“We’ve seen a good combination of political will with the reality of the electricity market there that have led people to start building in Texas,” said Josh Goodbody, chief operating office of Qredo, a digital asset management company. “Increasingly, people are looking at Texas as a friendly place to build crypto businesses.”

Along with the Argo and Whinstone facilities, BIT Mining, a Chinese mining company, has invested $25m to build a mine in Texas.

An influx of interest from cryptocurrency businesses does not come without risk, though. Bitmain, a China-based company, said in 2018 that it would invest $500m to build a huge mining facility in Rockdale, bringing jobs to a community that has seen huge job losses after a coal plant closure in 2008. But after the price of bitcoin dropped to just over $3,000 in the fall, the company pulled out of the project.

Brendle, of Dickens, said that his optimism is cautious. He has hope that cryptocurrency mining will be able to bolster his county’s economy and give stable jobs to some of his residents, but he notes that long-term sustainability is important.

“We see movement now, we see a lot of interest. We understand why that interest is there. But we just don’t know what the future of bitcoin mining is,” Brendle said. “I think that’s the biggest concern right now is how long, how well the industry will sustain itself.”","('https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f44434624752c0844ffd65649394276dca9de43d/0_141_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f5cc031656529a023526260d6883c543',)",none

2021-08-16,Gadgets 360,ADA Token on Cardano Blockchain Becomes Third-Largest Cryptocurrency as Developers Look to Ride DeFi Boom,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/ada-cardano-price-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ether-third-largest-defi-boom-2512196,"A little-known digital token linked to the Cardano blockchain has just become the third-largest virtual currency in the world as network developers look to ride the boom in decentralised finance.

With the so-called ADA cryptocurrency jumping around 50 percent over the past week alone, optimism is rising that new technological enhancements will allow smart contracts on Cardano by its announced goal of September 12. That will enable its network to offer lucrative services like DeFi, where Ethereum currently dominates. ADA Price in India in stood at Rs. 163 while Ethereum price in India stood at Rs. 2.48 lakhs as of 11am IST on August 17.

In a rally met with skepticism by some big industry names, the ADA token now has a market value of more than $69 billion (roughly Rs. 5,12,360 crores) - bigger than all rivals except Bitcoin and Ether, according to tracker CoinGecko. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36 lakhs as of 11am IST on August 17.

“The Cardano aficionados have been awaiting - some impatiently - for what seems like an eternity for some news on smart contracts,” said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner and co-founder of crypto lender Nexo. “Cardano is tussling with no. 2 crypto Ethereum to be the preeminent blockchain offering smart contracts.”

The more than 1,400 percent jump in ADA over the past year exceeds the returns from both Bitcoin and Ether.

The virtual coin has climbed despite skepticism about its utility from some prominent cryptocurrency commentators. For instance, Galaxy Digital LP Chief Executive Officer Mike Novogratz posted on Twitter on Sunday that “I spoke to twenty of the smartest people I know in the space, and zero of them saw Cardano having traction” with developers.

“Most people outside crypto have never even heard of Cardano - yet here it is with a market cap” that tops many S&P 500 index constituents, Trenchev said.

Decentralised finance - or DeFi - ports financial functions onto digital ledgers, allowing people to do things like lend or borrow funds and earn interest in a savings-like account without the need for traditional intermediaries such as banks. Its growing popularity is part of a wider trend of increased blockchain usage.

Recent rallies in Bitcoin, Ether, ADA, and other tokens helped the cryptocurrency market vault past $2 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,48,50,910 crores) in value over the weekend for the first time since May, when the famously volatile sector succumbed to a rout.

2021-08-16,The Indian Express,Two arrested in Bengaluru for cryptocurrency cheating worth Rs 3.5 crore,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/two-arrested-bengaluru-cryptocurrency-cheating-3-5-crore-7457588/,"Two persons in Bengaluru, including a cryptocurrency trading agent, have been arrested for cheating a city based businessman of Rs 3.5 crore on the pretext of helping him invest in cryptocurrency. The arrested are Piyushbhai Himmatlal Soni and Rajeshbhai Dhirajlal Soni from Gujarat. They were arrested based on a complaint filed by businessman Gowtham, 37, a resident of JP Nagar. The prime accused in the case, Kunal Anup Chandrana, is absconding. A local court had dismissed Chandrana’s anticipatory bail plea on August 10 and they were later arrested.

According to a senior police officer, Gowtham’s friend Ramesh TV claimed he made profits in cryptocurrency trading and that made Gowtham invest in the same. In his complaint, Gowtham said, “as he lacked knowledge in cryptocurrency, he sought Ramesh’s help to befriend Chandrana who claimed to be an expert.”

On May 15, Gowtham on demand transferred Rs 3.5 crore to two bank accounts provided by Chandrana to purchase cryptocurrency. However, Chandrana neither bought cryptocurrency nor returned money. When asked, Chandrana gave reasons which did not convince Gowtham. He filed a complaint with South Cyber, Economic and Narcotics (CEN) police station.

Police who gathered details reportedly called Chandrana to appear before them and then Chandrana approached a local court seeking anticipatory bail in the case. While the attempts to evade arrest were happening in the first week of August, the cops found out that Gowtham had transferred money on May 15 and 17 and traced Piyushbhai and Rajeshbhai.

On August 10, the court rejecting the bail plea said, “the investigation officer must recover the currency and record his statement.” The police said the probe is underway.

A senior police officer said there are a lot of people in the disguise of cryptocurrency trading experts luring public on Telegram and other platforms assuring to get attractive returns on their investments and many of them in the city have been conned but the cases are under reported. As many of them do not have knowledge of how cryptocurrency trading works, they believe these agents and transfer money ending up getting cheated. Cryptocurrency trading scams have been reported in India after the Supreme Court lifted the ban on trading of cryptocurrencies last year.

In March this year, a 38-year-old lecturer, a resident of palace Guttahalli who was new to the cryptocurrency world lost bitcoins worth Rs 10 lakh to a fraudster who had promised to handle his cryptocurrency account. He had shared his login credentials on Telegram mobile application and the scamster siphoned the money.

Criminal Investigation Department (CID) last year May arrested a 26 year old woman entrepreneur who stole bitcoins worth Rs 3.7 crore from a company she co-founded.","('https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/08/Handcuffs-crime-1200-2.jpg',)",none

2021-08-16,The Financial Express,Planning to invest in cryptocurrency? You should know about these three types of transaction fees,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/planning-to-invest-in-cryptocurrency-you-should-know-about-these-three-types-of-transaction-fees/2312262/,"Representative image

Cryptocurrency exchange, as the name suggests, is a platform where you can trade between cryptocurrencies based on their current market value. The value of crypto currencies is determined by the demand, the supply and market. It is very similar to a stock exchange where you buy and sell shares of companies. On a cryptocurrency exchange you buy cryptocurrency at a certain price and you sell it when the price increases to make a profit, it is based on the fundamental principle of entering the market and exiting at the right time. Similar to a stock exchange, cryptocurrency exchange also involves transaction charges on the trades done by the trader. In this article, we will explain trading fees levied by cryptocurrency exchanges.

If you are planning to invest in crypto, you should be aware that there are broadly three types of transaction fees involved in crypto trading:

Exchange fees: While trading in cryptocurrency, the first transaction fee that a trader need to be aware of is the exchange fee. Exchange fee is the amount charged by the cryptocurrency exchange to complete a buy or sell order. In India, most of the cryptocurrency exchanges have a fixed fee model but the final cost of transaction depends on the platform you are using to complete the transaction. As a smart trader, you should do good research and find out which crypto exchanges offer lowest transaction fees.

Maker-Taker fee model also exists within crypto exchanges. The maker is the seller of cryptocurrency and taker is the buyer of crypto currency, this model charges a variable fee depending on your amount of trading activity. If you are an active trader or you have transacted a high value over a longer rolling period, you may qualify (as a maker) for a reduced transaction fee. The fees structure under this model is different for centralized and decentralized exchanges.

The exchange fee is the primary source of revenue for the exchanges and forms an integral part of their business model.

Network fees: Network fee is payable to the cryptocurrency miners for the work they do. Cryptocurrency miners are individuals with powerful computers which are dedicated to verifying and validating transactions to be added to a blockchain. In a nutshell, they play an important part in crypto transactions by ensuring that tokens weren’t spent twice and transactions are real and true. The cryptocurrency exchange has no direct control over the network fees and it is payable to the miners/validator of the network. Network fees are driven by demand, when the network becomes crowded, fees may increase. Users are normally allowed to pre-set the transaction fee they are willing to pay for their transactions when they are using a third party wallet but while they are using exchange, it is setup automatically by exchanges itself to avoid any kind of delay in transfers.

The time taken for the validation of such transactions can vary by network as it depends on miners deciding their own fee and Users choosing whether to accept or not the fee setup by the miners. So the time taken for validating a transaction is inversely proportional to the transaction fee User is willing to pay. Users who are willing to pay the network fee setup by the miners, will see their transactions getting validated quickly. It is important to note that miners are not free loaders but get paid for the electricity cost and vast processing power.

Wallet fees: While trading in cryptocurrency, you store your cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. Digital wallet is like an online bank account where you keep your cryptocurrency safe. The crypto wallet enables you to receive cryptocurrency and store them safely and makes it easier for you to use your cryptocurrency or send to others. Most of the wallets don’t charge any fee on deposits and storage of cryptocurrency but charge a fee on withdrawing/sending cryptocurrency from the wallet which is basically network fees. Crypto wallets offer systematic cryptocurrency buying options and have integrated merchant gateway service through which you can even recharge your smartphones and DTH services.

Most exchanges provide an in-Built wallet functionality where users can store all their crypto at one place and no fees are charged for storing and depositing in the wallet.

Transaction fees and charges are an important part of the financial/investment services sector. The funds collected through such transaction charges are crucial for companies which enable the traders and institutions to invest in cryptocurrency from the comfort of their home through their platform. Every investment service has a team of dedicated professionals working behind the scenes to provide seamless investment experience to the traders and institutions 24×7, 7 days a week and 365 days a year. Cryptocurrency based products and services are capable of providing sustainable economic growth. Cryptocurrency is entering the investment portfolio of Indians very quickly and will emerge as the most secure & lucrative asset class of the 21st century.

Myth 1 - Cryptocurrency is illegal:

Myth 2 - Cryptocurrency is used for criminal activity:

Myth 3 - It can replace Indian currency:

Myth 4 - Cryptocurrency trading is very complex:

Myth 5 - I have missed the bus and now I can’t afford to buy Cryptocurrency:

NEW DELHI: In India, the cryptocurrency craze is not only limited to cities, but has even reached Tier 2 and 3 towns. As of today, there are more than 1.5 crore Indians holding over Rs 1,500 crore worth of cryptocurrencies.If you too are someone who’s looking to invest in cryptocurrency, it’s important that you stay clear of the myths and misinformation that surround the topic. We’ve got you covered on this front. Here’s debunking some popular cryptocurrency myths with facts.The biggest myth of them all is that cryptocurrency is illegal. However, reality is that crypto is a perfectly valid form of investments and payment . Unocoin, a cryptocurrency trading portal in India, recently announced that its customers can use their crypto coins to buy vouchers that can then be redeemed to buy a variety of things.Many people wrongfully link cryptocurrency to criminal activity because of the unregulated nature of the digital currency. But this is not true. In fact, in March 2020, the Supreme Court lifted the Reserve Bank Of India ’s ban on crypto transactions, thus lending the digital currency a shred of legitimacy.This is not true. Indian currency is issued by the Reserve Bank of India and is backed by a sovereign guarantee. Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is not issued by any bank. While it’s definitely getting popular among investors, there’s no way it will replace the rupee.Cryptocurrency trading is not as complex as many people think it is. In fact, it is as easy as buying a share on a share trading platform. A person has to simply open an account and transact. However, you need to be fully aware of what you’re getting into before you start investing in cryptoAgain, untrue. Even though a single bitcoin is currently trading at around Rs 36 lakh, you can still own a crypto. There are several trading platforms that allow customers to buy a fraction of the coin. Crypto platforms are going all out to woo investors. Zebpay , a trading platform, even offers upto 12% annualised rate of return on cryptocurrencies.Furthermore, different cryptocurrencies are valued differently. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are valued in lakhs, other currency options like an EOS or Litecoin can be purchased at approximately Rs 430 and Rs 13,700 respectively. (These were the values at the time of filing the story.)A word of caution here. Cryptocurrency is not a get-rich scheme. It’s an investment option just like gold, commodities, mutual funds etc. and you must weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before buying it.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85390481,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-514834,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Can you buy daily use items using Bitcoins?

What about India?

How does it work?

NEW DELHI: As interest around cryptocurrency surges globally, corporates are trying to stay up to speed to facilitate the purchase of various things using the digital currency. Bitcoin, which is the world’s largest cryptocurrency with a market share of 44.7 per cent, is steadily gaining acceptance across the world as a legitimate way of paying for goods and services.A survey conducted in the US last year revealed that 36 per cent of small and mid-sized businesses in that country accepted cryptocurrency, while 59 per cent of those companies purchased digital currency for their own use as well.Companies like Microsoft , Wikipedia, AT&T, Intuit and Shopify are known to have accepted Bitcoin payments for their services. You could also buy flight tickets with Norwegian Air Shuttle and Virgin Galactic using Bitcoins. Virgin Galactic offers flight tickets only for space tourism, though! And at least one US-based Lamborghini dealer claims to accept payment in cryptocurrency. If you are a fan of Tesla cars, there’s good news. In a virtual conference last month, Tesla founder Elon Musk mentioned that his company would resume accepting Bitcoins after due diligence to confirm the percentage of renewable energy used in mining bitcoins.The answer is yes, depending on which part of the world you’re in! Burger King and Pizza Hut in Venezuela, KFC in Canada and several Subway and Pizza Hut outlets in different countries accept or have accepted payment in Bitcoins. A lot of online platforms issue vouchers that can be purchased using cryptocurrency.India is slowly opening up to the idea of accepting it as a legitimate payment method. Unocoin, a bitcoin trading site, is now allowing its users to buy vouchers from over 90 different brands using Bitcoins. A registered user of Unocoin can use a Bitcoin worth as little as Rs 100 and as much as Rs 5000 to avail these vouchers.Using these vouchers, you can buy Domino's pizza, ice-cream from Baskin Robbins, beauty and health products from Himalaya, and even home appliances from Prestige.According to the company, once the user selects the amount, the corresponding value of bitcoin will be displayed. After paying the amount, the user receives the voucher code and that is where the transaction ends – much like the Point Of Sales process, says their portal.This is the first time that a virtual currency is being used in India for paying for goods and services. Bitcoin's volatile price may cause some initial hiccups for consumers, but with time, the process is likely to stabilise. Megastore chains in India may soon start training their crew for this process.In case of a refund, it can be paid in either the exact amount of Bitcoins or its value in legal tender (Rs in India and $ in the US). In any case, if the value of Bitcoin shoots up before a refund is issued, the customer stands to lose. These should apply only to big ticket purchases such as cars and motorcycles, the portal clarifies.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85390350,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-703800,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

currencies legal tender?

2) Is it a valid currency in India?

3)

judgement on Crypto:

4) Am I doing anything wrong by trading in cryptocurrencies?

5) How safe is it to trade in cryptocurrencies?

NEW DELHI: Cryptocurrency is fast gaining ground as an exciting option among investors in India. The past few years have seen a burgeoning number of investors and analytics suggest that it isn’t just city slickers - most of its recent users come from small cities and towns in India.However, despite the mounting excitement, much ambiguity persists around the legality of cryptocurrency in India. If you are considering investing in cryptocurrencies, you want to be sure you are not breaking any law or regulations. Therefore, it’s important to understand the legality that surrounds cryptocurrencies clearly. Here’s a quick primer for you to get going.Whether an activity is in compliance with the law of the land is critical to understand before wading into the domain..Here’s a simple analogy: Think of the Internet, it is free, used by billions of people around the world, yet no country owns it or controls it. Cryptocurrency (or crypto, in short) is also somewhat like the Internet. It is not owned or controlled by a country or a bank. They are not issued by the central bank of the country (in our case, the Reserve Bank Of India ) as legal tender. Neither are they recognised by the Government as legal tender nor are they regulated by the RBI. There are no laws that prohibit (or allow) trading in crypto. In that sense, cryptocurrency is like any other asset class such as gold, commodities or real estate. People trade in gold without the government creating a law for it. Same is the status of cryptocurrency at the moment.It isn’t a valid currency in the conventional sense, which means that you cannot pay with cryptocurrency to buy and sell anything in India. The currency of a country is legal tender backed by a sovereign guarantee. In India, only the central bank (RBI) can issue any currency.Crypto, on the other hand, is minted across the world by a complex decentralised, peer-to-peer powerfully coded system. Since it can be traded online within the country, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies and valid as an asset class in India.In the year 2018, RBI had prohibited banks, Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and payment systems regulated by it, from facilitating financial transactions for entities related to cryptocurrencies. However, this was quashed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in March 2020. The judgement has paved the way for financial institutions facilitating the trading of cryptocurrencies, creating the ground for several crypto market exchanges in the country.No, you are not breaking the law in any way! There is no regulation governing cryptocurrencies in India so far. Recently, during a Parliament session there was a question on whether the Centre intended to bring in a specific regulation around cryptocurrency trading in India. The government responded that if there was a legislative proposal regarding cryptocurrencies and their trading, , it would be introduced in Parliament following due process.It is as safe as any other investment class, and is subject to underlying market risks such as mutual funds or stock investments. However, share trading and mutual funds are regulated by the government-appointed Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ). Due to its decentralised nature, the trading of cryptocurrencies doesn’t fall under the ambit of any regulator and they can be volatile.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85390314,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1251260,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency , is up over 59% this year (year-to-date). As per CoinDesk, Bitcoin prices declined 3% to $46,231.

Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, was also trading with cuts of 4% at $3,174. Dogecoin, on the other hand, plunged nearly 4% to $0.32. Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also fell over the last 24 hours.

The total market value of cryptocurrencies rose above $2 trillion again as Bitcoin continued to climb and the likes of Cardano, XRP and Dogecoin advanced as well. Crypto’s market value rose to $2.06 trillion on Saturday, according to CoinGecko, which tracks more than 8,800 coins. Bitcoin reached as high as $48,152, the highest level since May 16, as it showed staying power above its 200-day moving average.

Meanwhile, India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed that the proposed legislation on cryptocurrencies has been tabled before the Cabinet and awaiting its approval. ""Cabinet note is ready on cryptocurrency (Bill). I am awaiting Cabinet to clear that,"" the minister told reporters during an interaction on Monday. India has been on the fence on cryptocurrencies for long, gradually making up its mind to whether accept or reject digital currencies.

In another news, retail giant Walmart Inc. is looking to hire a cryptocurrency expert to develop a blockchain strategy, joining a growing number of major corporations exploring the viability of digital currencies such as Bitcoin.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped Bitcoin rally.

Use Bitcoin to buy Domino's Pizza, Baskin Robin ice creams and more in India: Know how



India’s oldest cryptocurrency trading platform Unocoin has allowed its users to use bitcoins to buy Domino's Pizza, Baskin Robin ice creams, coffee from Cafe Coffee Day, and other utilities from over 90 different brands by using Bitcoins. A registered user of Unocoin can use bitcoin worth as little as INR 100 and as much as Rs 5,000 to avail of these vouchers from these brands, the Bengaluru-based startup said. Read details here.

The Union Cabinet is soon expected to take up a bill to regulate cryptocurrency and its growing market in India, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on August 16.

""Cabinet note is ready on cryptocurrency bill. I am awaiting Cabinet to clear that,"" Sitharaman said during an interaction with reporters.

In the past, Sitharaman has made her stance on cryptocurrency clear, saying that the government was not looking to shut all options and that people will be given adequate windows to experiment with blockchain, bitcoins and cryptocurrency.

In late July, Sitharaman had informed Rajya Sabha that the government does not collect information on the number of cryptocurrency exchanges and investors in India. She also said that the Finance Ministry has received no information on whether some of these exchanges are involved in narcotic drug trafficking or money laundering.

According to data from crypto exchanges, there are approximately 1.5 crore Indians who have invested in cryptocurrencies holding worth Rs 15,000 crore, with more and more people starting to invest. There are 350 startups that operate in the blockchain and crypto space.

As Moneycontrol had reported earlier, it is understood that while there will be no outright ban on cryptocurrencies, they won’t be allowed as legal tender either. Rather, cryptocurrencies are likely to be treated as a tradable asset class with a market.

A cabinet clearance between now and November means that the bill will likely be tabled in the Winter Session of Parliament.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/08/cryptocurrency-770x433.jpg',)",none

A new study shows that ethereum is the most popular cryptocurrency among more than 4,000 adults surveyed in Singapore. The second-most popular crypto is bitcoin, followed by cardano.

Singapore-Based Crypto Investors Prefer Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cardano

The new 2021 State of Crypto in Singapore, a joint study by Seedly, Gemini, and Coinmarketcap, was published Monday. It contains a survey of 4,348 Singapore-based adults ages 18 to 65 across varying household incomes.

The survey was conducted between June 29 and July 9. It included 2,862 respondents who said they were current crypto holders and 1,486 respondents who said they were non-crypto holders. One in five crypto holders surveyed were women.

According to the survey results, 78% of respondents who had crypto said they owned ethereum (ETH), 69% said bitcoin (BTC), 40% said cardano (ADA), 31% said binance coin (BNB), and 25% said XRP. The report describes:

Of the 2,862 crypto holders, 2,236 of them are currently holding on to ETH. BTC is the second most popular cryptocurrency, with 1,975 of the crypto holders holding on to it. Coming in third and fourth are ADA and BNB , held by 1,141 and 893 investors respectively.

The report notes: “With ETH, BTC and ADA being the most popular cryptocurrencies across both genders, females actually hold and trade XRP and DOT [polkadot] more than their male counterparts. USDT [tether], on the other hand, is more popular among male crypto holders.”

Crypto investors also revealed how they were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The report notes, “Out of 2,862 people who invested in crypto, two-thirds of them invested more into crypto because of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The report adds, “The Covid-19 pandemic has spurred more Singaporeans to invest in crypto.”

2021-08-16,CNBC,"The crypto market topped $2 trillion for the first time since May, and 6 other key things that happened in crypto this past week",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/16/crypto-news-btc-doge-rally-microsoft-may-use-ethereum-for-antipiracy.html,"The top cryptocurrencies by market value saw a boost in price over the weekend. Bitcoin topped $48,000 on Saturday, which lifted the value of the entire cryptocurrency market above $2 trillion for the first time since May. Altcoins, like ether, dogecoin and cardano, jumped as well. This comes despite a relatively tough past week for the industry. From the Senate passing the infrastructure bill without an amendment to its crypto tax reporting provision to over $600 million in crypto stolen in a record DeFi, or decentralized finance, hack, here are six things worth knowing.

1. Senate passes infrastructure bill without an amendment to crypto tax provision

After contention over the language in its provision on cryptocurrency tax reporting, the Senate passed the $1 trillion infrastructure bill on Tuesday without an amendment. Now, many House democrats are urging for change, just like crypto advocates and many Senators attempted prior. Currently, the bill defines a ""broker"" as ""any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person,"" which crypto advocates say is too broad. As written, it could potentially target miners, developers, stakers and others who do not have customers and therefore wouldn't have access to the information needed to comply.

Since the infrastructure bill passed in the Senate, members of the House, including Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., Bill Foster, D-Ill., and Darren Soto, D-Fla., have urged for adjustment and called for the definition of a ""broker"" to be narrowed. If the House amends the bill, it would then be sent back to the Senate for another vote before proceeding to President Joe Biden's desk. But to avoid further delay, the U.S. Treasury Department plans to clarify its definition of a ""broker"" without amending the bill, Bloomberg reports, citing a Treasury official. The bill would remain unchanged, but the Treasury would verbally promise not to target non-brokers when later writing the tax law. Policymakers are set to meet this week to discuss.

2. A record $600 million was stolen in a DeFi hack

3. Coinbase reports that Ethereum trading volume was higher than bitcoin's for the first time in Q2

In its second quarter earnings report released on Tuesday, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase reported revenue that was stronger than analysts had expected. It brought in $2.23 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion in net profit. Coinbase also reported that total trading volume on the platform went beyond bitcoin during the quarter. For the first time, Ethereum trading volume was higher than bitcoin trading volume.

4. Walmart is hiring a digital currency and cryptocurrency product lead

Walmart is looking to add a ""digital currency and cryptocurrency product lead"" to its team, according to a recent job listing. The company is seeking to hire someone to ""own and drive the digital currency strategy for Walmart."" ""As an expert in digital currencies/cryptocurrency and blockchain related technologies, you will drive the vision for the product and capabilities roadmap. You will provide the leadership to identify technology and customer trends and the investments needed to build on those trends,"" the job posting reads. In July, Amazon announced it was seeking to hire a similar role.

5. Mark Cuban and Elon Musk agree that dogecoin is 'strongest' as medium of exchange

Extending a week-long rally that saw its price appreciate by more than 56%, SOL recorded a 472.48% uptick in daily trading volume, which exceeded $3.9 billion at the time of writing.

The hybrid blockchain is often referred to as 'Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) killer' because of its incredibly short processing times.

As one crypto trader pointed out, Solana processes about as many transactions in a month as Ethereum has in its entire history.

While this has more to do with Solana’s network capacity than user growth, the blockchain recorded a total transaction volume of 24.1 billion as of this weekend.

Meanwhile, the Total Value Locked (TVL) of DeFi on Solana reached $1.96 billion driven by decentralized exchange Serum (CRYPTO: SRM) and its automated market maker and liquidity provider Raydium Protocol (CRYPTO: RAY).

What Else: Last week, another Solana-powered decentralized exchange Mango Markets (CRYPTO: MNGO), raised $70.5 million in one of the largest token sales in DeFi history.

According to the decentralized exchange, Solana’s total transaction fees on user deposits were as low as $126 for the token sale’s peak liquidity of $500 million.

“Solana is in hyper drive, pushing boundaries and growing faster than all its predecessors. It will inevitably be met with criticism, but that's not a bad thing. We will simply take the legitimate criticism and continue to improve exponentially,” commented Chase Barker, developer relations lead at Solana.

Microsoft is looking to use the ethereum blockchain to combat digital piracy, according to a recent white paper published by the firm.

The company is exploring a new system named Argus, which it dubbed as the ""first public anti-piracy system.""

Across 11 pages, Microsoft laid out the design, implementation, and evaluation of the new system.

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.

Software giant Microsoft is looking to use the ethereum blockchain to combat digital piracy by relying on the network's transparent and decentralized nature, according to a new paper released by the firm's research department.

The Redmond-based company is exploring a new concrete system named Argus, which Microsoft dubbed as the ""first public anti-piracy system.""

In the 11-page paper, Microsoft - together with researchers from Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba and Carnegie Mellon University - laid out the design, implementation, and evaluation of the new system.

CoinTelegraph was the first to report on the initiative.

Microsoft says Argus will run on a public blockchain in order to allow digital piracy informers to remain anonymous while maintaining a certain level of transparency for the wider public at the same time.

Reports filed to Argus, for instance, will protect the identity of the informers but allow the firm to backtrack the source of the pirated content.

A blockchain is a form of public ledger, in which every transaction is recorded after it is authenticated.

Furthermore, by optimizing several cryptographic operations, the cost for piracy reporting will be ""reduced to an equivalent cost of sending about 14 ETH-transfer transactions,"" the company added, contrary to the typically high transaction fees ethereum is known for.

""With the security and practicality of Argus, we hope real-world antipiracy campaigns will be truly effective by shifting to a fully transparent incentive mechanism,"" the paper said.

The latest effort undertaken by Microsoft highlights the obstacles faced by technology firms in protecting their intellectual properties.

This boost came after billionaire investor Mark Cuban told CNBC Make It last week that ""the community for doge is the strongest when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange."" On Twitter, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said that he agrees.

""I've been saying this for a while,"" Musk tweeted on Saturday.

In May, Musk tweeted that he has been working with dogecoin developers to ""improve system transaction efficiency."" Musk also reportedly told a dogecoin developer that his goal is to make dogecoin easy enough to use that investors could use it to pay for a cup of coffee.

""The point is that dogecoin was invented as a joke as essentially to make fun of cryptocurrency,"" Musk told TMZ in May. ""Fate loves irony. What would be the most ironic outcome? The currency that started as a joke in fact becomes the real currency.""

""Cabinet note is ready on cryptocurrency (Bill). I am awaiting Cabinet to clear that,"" the minister told reporters during an interaction on Monday.

India has been on the fence on cryptocurrencies for long, gradually making up its mind to whether accept or reject digital currencies.

An inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency, chaired by Secretary (Economic Affairs), to study the issues related to virtual currencies and propose specific actions has already submitted its report. It has recommended that all private cryptocurrencies, except any virtual currencies issued by state, will be prohibited in India.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also raised concerns on the cryptocurrencies traded in the market and conveyed them to the Centre.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had emphasised that there are no differences between the central bank and the Finance Ministry on cryptocurrencies. He had said he has ""reasons to believe"" that the government is in agreement with the ""major concerns"" flagged by the RBI about the cryptocurrencies.

""We should now await the final decision on the matter"" from the Centre, he had added.

Back in March, the Supreme Court had allowed banks and financial institutions to reinstate services related to cryptocurrencies by setting aside the RBI's 2018 circular that had prohibited them.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of their units and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

A three-judge bench, headed by Justice R F Nariman, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular is liable to be set aside on the ground of ""proportionality"".

""Accordingly, the writ petitions are allowed and the circular dated April 6, 2018 is set aside,"" said the bench, also comprising justices Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian.

Dado Ruvic | Reuters

Bitcoin topped $48,000 over the weekend, its highest level since May, but pared some of those gains on Monday. On Saturday, the digital coin hit $48,126.47, its highest level since May 17, according to Coindesk data. It last traded $45,831.37 according to Coin Metrics. The bitcoin recovery comes after it sold off heavily in June and July, dropping below $30,000 following a record high of over $64,000 in April. ""I do believe this (bitcoin's rise) is the result of massive accumulation"" when bitcoin was trading around $29,000 to $30,000, according to Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno.

Bitcoin's rise lifted the value of the entire cryptocurrency market above $2 trillion on Saturday for the first time since mid-May, according to data from CoinMarketCap, which tracks the prices of digital coins. The crypto market has faced a number of headwinds over the summer. One of the biggest was the renewed regulatory scrutiny on the industry from authorities in China which has forced bitcoin mining operations to shut down and move elsewhere. That was one of the biggest reasons for bitcoin dropping below the $30,000 level. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate passed a massive infrastructure bill last week without any of the proposed amendments on crypto tax reporting that had delayed its passage. That was seen as a blow for the crypto community, but some said it showed the U.S. government was taking the industry seriously. These ""fundamental regulatory roadblocks"" have ""clipped the market's wings"" in the near term, said Jehan Chu, founder of cryptocurrency-focused venture capital and trading firm Kenetic Capital.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106911087-16263029762021-07-12t182451z_1049474836_rc26jo9ua1af_rtrmadp_0_fintech-crypto-flows.jpeg?v=1626462384',)",none

2021-08-16,NDTV.com,Crypto Relief Donations To India During Covid-19 Second Wave. What Was It?,https://www.ndtv.com/business/crypto-relief-poured-into-india-during-covid-19-second-wave-what-was-it-2511771,"Cryptocurrency is still a grey area in India as far as legislation is concerned

As India suffered under the second wave of Covid-19, we saw donations from all around the world pouring into the country's relief funds. And help came in all forms. One of the most eye-catching phenomena was the heap of donations made through cryptocurrency, which, by the way, has not yet been legalised in India. Big names in the crypto-trading front and entrepreneurs announced monetary help for India to tide over the crisis.

Donations

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated dogecoins worth $1 billion (roughly Rs 7000 crore) and later added more worth $3 million (roughly Rs 44 crore). Former Australian cricketer Bret Lee also donated one bitcoin (roughly Rs 45 lakh). Entrepreneur and angel investor Balaji Srinivasan donated $50,000 (roughly Rs 36.68 lakh) worth of Ether. Later, he planned to double his donations to $100,000.

Ethereum-linked Polygon (previously Matic) co-founder Sandeep Nailwal started Crypto Relief as a COVID-19 relief initiative for India in April this year. He set it up with the help of some volunteers. He also figured ways to collect the cryptocurrency in UAE in crypto wallets, convert them into fiat currency and transfer them through the US to India in ways that most suited Indian legislation.

Nailwal's relief fund has collected donations worth approximately $6 million (roughly Rs 44 crore) in 10 different cryptocurrencies. Crypto Relief has reportedly disbursed over $999,900 (roughly Rs 7.4 crore) already. This was done through United Way of Bengaluru to ACT Grants, which supports demands for medical oxygen in India.

Crypto Relief also tied up with tech-enabled healthcare supply platforms like Medikabazaar and Aknamed.

Issues

Cryptocurrency is still a grey area in India as far as legislation is concerned. Cryptocurrency has not yet been brought under any legal regulation yet. The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 is underway. There are also reports that the government is planning to launch its own official Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) that will be backed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In March 2020, the Supreme Court quashed the RBI ban on virtual currencies but the bank hasn't yet clarified its stand. The confusion can cause an upheaval in the Indian market, where investments in cryptocurrency can be pegged at almost $1.5 billion (roughly Rs 10,000 crore).","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-02/kq34jumk_cryptocurrency-bitcoin-reuters_625x300_11_February_21.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrencies are about more than just money, but not too many newbie investors know about the underlying technology that powers the value of virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, Doge and others.Why they’re all technically ‘ cryptocurrencies ’ running on one blockchain or the other, each one proposes to solve a different problem and derives its value in a different way.According to Bakkt Holdings, a digital asset financial firm, the market for cryptocurrencies may hit $3 trillion over the next four years if not sooner. It already crossed the $2 trillion mark last week before slipping slightly to settle at $1.96 trillion on Sunday, August 15.India is home to one of the largest populations ofholders in the world, according to a new report by Finder . WazirX, a crypto exchange based in India backed by the global crypto behemoth Binance, saw new users jump by 2,648% in 2021 as compared to last year. Most of these users came from smaller towns and cities — like Mohali, Lucknow and Ranchi — rather than urban metropolitan areas.According to leaders in the space, Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein , financial assets like cryptocurrencies only come along once in a generation. And, they could become the most important asset class of the 21st century if current trends continue and new use cases continue to emerge.If you’re one of the many people out there looking to diversify your investments and dip your toe in the crypto market, doing your own research (DYOR) is imperative.

2021-08-16,Dallas Morning News,"What were you doing in grade school? These Frisco kids are making $32,000 a month mining Ethereum",https://www.dallasnews.com/business/entrepreneurs/2021/08/16/what-were-you-doing-in-grade-school-these-frisco-kids-are-making-32000-a-month-mining-ethereum/,"Ishaan Thakur, 14, and his little sister, Aanya, 9, typically ran a lemonade stand each summer that netted them about $100 for their college fund.

But in February, after their dad told them a bedtime story about bitcoin prices spiking to over $50,000, the Frisco duo dreamed up a new money-making idea: mining Ethereum.

“We wanted to invest in it, but we didn’t have the money to buy bitcoin,” Ishaan said. “So instead, we bought the equipment to mine for it instead.”

They started mining in March with an old gaming computer, making $1,000 in their first month. For the past month, they made more than $32,000. They use their earnings to buy more mining equipment for their company, Flifer Technologies, which they created on April 30.

“I thought I wouldn’t be able to do it because it’s too high-level, but we watched YouTube videos and my dad and sister helped,” said Ishaan, a ninth-grader at Frisco High School.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in the world with a value of around $44,455 per coin and a market value of $835 billion, according to Coindesk.com. Ethereum is the second-largest with a value of around $3,055 and a $357 billion market value. They decided bitcoin had become too competitive so they chose to mine Ethereum.

Building a cryptomining rig came with one major COVID-19-era complication: a chip shortage.

Ishaan and Aanya, a fourth-grader at Spears Elementary, signed up for supply updates from Best Buy and Micro Center. When they got an evening email alerting them to parts, they’d line up hours before the store opened the next morning.

“There’s usually hundreds lined up but most are looking to resell the parts online for a higher price,” Ishaan said.

Other times, they’ve been able to find deals on eBay. Their dad, Manish Raj, a former Wall Street investment banker, took out a loan to help them purchase supplies to start.

The main equipment needed is graphics cards, which use software to guess the right code to get a bitcoin. They have 94 processors mining and mainly use Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics cards. When the computers guess the right code, they get a bitcoin.

It’s a guessing game, and their current setup makes about 9 billion guesses per second.

“Crypto mining is just like mining for gold or diamond,” Ishaan said. “Instead of using shovels, you mine with computers. Instead of finding a piece of gold or diamond in the mine, you find a piece of cryptocurrency.”

While YouTube videos showed them step-by-step directions, they estimate it takes about 10 hours per rig to set up. But once the rigs are set up, it becomes a passive income maker.

They have 14 rigs comprising 82 processors mining for Ethereum and five small rigs with 12 processors mining for Raven Coin (because those processors weren’t optimized for Ethereum). They’ve ordered four additional rigs from China with built-in processors.

“We want to grow this into a big thing,” Ishaan said.

Ishaan and Aanya's portfolio in mid-August 2021.

A whirring sound is constant in their garage, where some of their rigs are kept for building and testing. Ishaan estimates they have about 30 cards in their garage setup, costing about $90,000 total, or $3,000 per card. Their main operations are now in an air-conditioned data center in downtown Dallas because the heat and noise were too great to keep confined to a garage.

Ishaan and Aanya said it was important for them to use renewable energy, which costs about 12 cents per kilowatt-hour versus traditional energy that costs about 10 cents.

The difference in cost is insignificant compared to what they make, especially because mining for Ethereum is more efficient than bitcoin. Last month’s electric bill, including their home and the data center, was $2,500. A typical home electric bill in the summer is $500 for them; with mining, it increased to $850. The downtown data center electric bill was $1,650.

This isn’t Ishaan’s first entrepreneurial pursuit. He also created a hat with a solar-powered mini fan on it to help keep people like construction workers cool in the heat. He and his dad applied for a U.S. patent for the product and plan to sell it. Outside of his business pursuits, he plays the saxophone.

The Thakurs are hoping their profits will help them pay for college. Ishaan hopes to go to the University of Pennsylvania and become a doctor. Aanya wants to go to New York and become a doctor as well. They’re equal partners in the company.

Some investors are wary of cryptocurrencies because of their volatility. But the brother-sister duo said they don’t have concerns about finding a buyer for their Ethereum when the time comes to pay for college because the market is very good. It has a larger market value than the largest companies, like Irving-based Exxon Mobil, which has a market value of $243 billion, they said.

So far, they’ve sold small amounts to pay for expenses such as the electric bill, graphic cards, software and the data center.

Cryptocurrency has grown in popularity this year, leading lawmakers to think more seriously about how to regulate it. Recently, Texas enacted HB 4474, the Virtual Currency Bill, which allows the 216 Texas state-chartered banks to provide safekeeping services for virtual currencies. This week, the U.S. Senate passed the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that requires more tax reporting for cryptocurrency transactions.

Ishaan said he tries to keep up with news on the cryptocurrency world. But neither he nor Aanya have told their friends about their latest venture.

“Most kids like to play games on their computer,” he said. “We like to build them, I guess.”","('https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/MsOj8wwOAprvZhHWNts_hUAjNI4=/1200x630/smart/filters:no_upscale()/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/dmn/RKSQ7USKXRE6ZEB66J3O7K3OEQ.jpg',)",none

The summer sizzle

Ethereum rival solana has soared almost 40% over the last 24 hours as bitcoin and other major ... [+] cryptocurrencies make minor price gains. CryptoCodex

As the weather's heated up, so has the cryptocurrency market. The combined value of the 11,000 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap has climbed further over $2 trillion during the weekend with some major coins making huge moves.

But bitcoin isn't one of them, with the world's largest cryptocurrency failing to make a break above $50,000 over the last couple of days. $50k is very much still in play, however, with some traders and investors eyeing even bigger prizes.

Ethereum has continued to run victory laps since its early-August upgrade, with its price now firmly above $3,000. Ethereum's biggest rivals are though painting a mixed picture, with cardano and Binance's BNB making low single-digit percentage gains. Meanwhile, polkadot, up 10%, pales in comparison to solana's near-40% rally over the last 24 hours that's pushed it into the crypto top ten by value, as measured by CoinGecko.

Solana, a blockchain trying to win market share from ethereum, has close links with the FTX crypto exchange—FTX's sister company Alameda Research is an investor in solana, and FTX also operates its own decentralized exchange called Serum on the solana blockchain.

Now watch this: FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried (who has donated $450,000 to a nonprofit that supports bitcoin developers) on what can we expect from the crypto market

Elsewhere, the meme-based dogecoin has climbed over 10% during the last 24-hour period as traders cheer support from billionaires-turned-crypto influencers Mark Cuban and Elon Musk—both of whom reaffirmed their support of the memecoin over the weekend.

Biden's looming CFTC chair pick

President Joe Biden plans to name Rostin Behnam to lead the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), according to a Bloomberg report, citing ""people with knowledge of the matter.""

The CFTC, which oversees much of the $582 trillion global derivatives market including cryptocurrency trading, has become a powerful force on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis.

It's thought Behnam's appointment announcement is still some weeks away, however.

Behnam, a commissioner at the CFTC since 2017 and acting chairman since January, signaled his broad support of blockchain technology and called for an ""open mind"" on the regulation of financial technology (fintech).

The CFTC has previously said it sees bitcoin as a commodity and permitted the CME Group, which it regulates, to list bitcoin futures contracts.

Cryptocurrency prices gained slightly on Monday after gaining steadily during the weekend. Most cryptocurrencies have maintained a positive momentum since last week including Bitcoin.

Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, was trading strong at over $47,200, up 2.93 per cent at 2:10 pm. Bitcoin has gained nearly 8 per cent in the past seven days and its market capitalisation has increased to $887 billion.

Ether has also gained over 3 per cent, and it is trading at nearly $3,300. The value of the second-most popular cryptocurrency has gained nearly 11 per cent in the past seven days and its market capitalisation has increased to $384 billion.

All other altcoin prices have also gained steadily including Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin, Polkadot, Uniswap, Chainlink, Luna, Solana and Litecoin.

Commenting on the steady rise in valuations, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “Over the past 24 hours, we witnessed the markets finding support.”

“The largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin, appears stable closer to the $48,000 level. The small candle body suggests a healthy stability. The second largest crypto, Ether, also reflected the same. Stability among the largest cryptos allows the Altcoins to make larger moves,” he added.

“Solana and Luna made significantly large upside moves over the past 24 hours.”

Here are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:

The second-largest cryptocurrency is going to get stronger.

The Cryptocurrency market is abuzz with activity and the latest being Ethereum’s big changes. Anticipated by many market experts, Ethereum is the second-largest Cryptocurrency in the market, next to Bitcoin. The world’s most used blockchain network, Ethereum, is bringing changes to the proof of work system.

Cryptocurrencies are dependent on the blockchain, a new technology that maintains a ledger of timely transactions. These ledgers are shared on computers globally and are decentralized. In simple terms, the ledgers are not operated by a central authority or a bank.

The first blockchain to ever be created was Bitcoin by Santoshi Nakamoto. While the identity of the man remains a mystery, his accomplishments solved the problem of double-spends in digital cash projects. How? The blockchain records every transaction on its network, so if someone is trying to reuse a Bitcoin, they would be easily caught.

The concept created by Santoshi Nakamoto wasn’t particularly new. Proof of work systems existed before Bitcoin’s arrival in 2008, but it was never put to use. Cryptocurrencies now use the blockchain to verify transactions and publish them to a public chain every few minutes. This is done by crypto miners which has another purpose too.

When Bitcoin was launched, it was worth nothing compared to what it is now. Eventually, its value increased because of miners and their race to validate blocks and earn rewards. This has created a new problem; mining is now energy-heavy and expensive. Hence, proof of work got criticism from environmentalists all over.

What’s the latest update about?

Let’s now talk about proof of stake. The logic behind this new system is to have a secured blockchain via a carrot and stick incentive for checking and cross-checking transactions collectively. Here’s a breakup of what happens.

• To take part in this initiative, participants should stake 32 Ether tokens.

• From the lot, people will be chosen at random to become validators for a batch of transactions.

• Validators will then share the new blocks with a group of members who are chosen to be attestors, 128 attestors to be specific.

• The attestors will review the work and accept or reject it accordingly. For every successful completion, the validators and attestors will be rewarded with free Ether.

Switching to proof of stake will cut down Ethereum’s energy consumption significantly, bringing down its carbon footprint. It will also increase the network’s speed and become a superior platform for financial and commercial transactions. From 30 transactions per second, it can go up to 100,000 transactions per second.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-ethereums-big-change-will-work-quicktake.jpg',)",none

Asian countries are pulling ahead in terms of crypto adoption worldwide. While countries in the region do present a large market in terms of numbers, barring China, most others have been seen as insignificant in the crypto world. However, a new report from research firm Finder says that the top five countries for cryptocurrency ownership are all in Asia.Vietnam had the largest percentage of crypto ownership at 40%, followed by Indonesia, India, Malaysia and Philippines, respectively. 30% of those surveyed in Indonesia and India said they owned cryptocurrencies, while Malaysia and Philippines had 29% and 28%, respectively.Meanwhile, the US and the UK had the least number of people who owned crypto, at 8% and 9%, respectively. This is an aberration from general tech trends since the two developed nations usually lead in terms of adoption of new technology worldwide.The company surveyed a total of 47,000 individuals around the world. “The US currently provides one of the most dynamic markets for cryptocurrencies. On the one hand it provides a progressive market that attracts many start-ups and tech companies, while on the other hand it still lacks regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies, with multiple companies being retroactively punished for their operations,” the report said.One trend that remains consistent across the world though is that younger users are leading the charge in terms of crypto adoption. The Finders reported that 18 to 34 year olds accounted for over 40% of users around the world.In addition, 35-44 year olds accounted for 20% of the user base, while 45-54 year olds accounted for 17%. In countries like Colombia and Netherlands, crypto adoption came from the elderly, above the 65-year-old age range.adoption in India has been driven by smaller towns of late. The country’s largest crypto exchange by trading volumes, WazirX, recently reported a 2,648% growth in user signups from Tier II and Tier III cities in the country. The exchange has over 7.3 million users and has amassed trading values worth over $21.8 billion in 2021 alone. To be fair, signups from urban centres in India were also growing, with 2,375% growth in user signups from Tier I cities.India’s crypto industry has been abuzz recently, with the government working on regulations and investors pouring in money into crypto firms. Coinbase backed CoinDCX became the country’s first billion dollar startup in the crypto space last week.“The cryptocurrency industry is steaming hot. 2021 has seen an accelerated interest in the crypto space as companies look to gain exposure to the market. A number of sectors floundered in FY21, given the challenges of doing business in a pandemic environment. Fintech, for the most part, was not one of them,"" Sharan Nair, chief business officer of Coinswitch Kuber, another top exchange in the country, told Mint That said, crypto adoption in these countries doesn’t necessarily mean the industry is out of hot water just yet. Most countries, including India, remain uncertain in terms of regulations.

10 cryptocurrencies that have been purchased the most in August.

Cryptocurrencies have taken a solid place in the trading market. A lot more people are interested in buying cryptocurrency and Analytics Insight has selected the 10 most purchased cryptocurrencies in August 2021.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is considered the original crypto, and its launch in 2009 is what started the whole cryptocurrency movement. Bitcoin – and the blockchain technology on which it operates – was invented by an individual or group of individuals operating under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was put forward as an alternative to the fiat monetary system. The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has never been revealed. In the Bitcoin whitepaper, Nakamoto argued that a fiat monetary system controlled by central banks and a small number of financial institutions led to a centralized wealth and power and made social and financial mobility difficult. Ordinary people’s savings were eroded through inflation, largely as a result of central banks’ money printing. Bitcoin solved that problem by fixing the number of units ever issued, thereby preventing inflation caused by money printing. Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer blockchain technology meant it didn’t need financial institutions to facilitate transactions and verify ownership. Bitcoin is still by far the most popular cryptocurrency and its price movement has a strong impact on the rest of the crypto market.

Ethereum (Ether)

Ethereum is historically the second most popular cryptocurrency however it is very different from Bitcoin. Ethereum is the name of the blockchain platform and Ether is the name of the cryptocurrency. Ethereum is the blockchain platform for smart contracts. They can also be considered as defined ‘rules’ from which many different applications, or Dapps – decentralized applications – can be created from. Ethereum Dapp’s range from games to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), which are the cryptocurrency world’s equivalent to crowdfunding or IPOs. While other smart contract platforms have been launched since Ethereum, each claiming to offer more sophisticated blockchain technology, the original blockchain has retained its position as the most utilized. While Bitcoin is intended as an alternative to traditional fiat currencies, the purpose of Ether (besides being traded as an asset) is to pay for use of the Ethereum platform. It’s known as a ‘utility’ cryptocurrency.

Ripple XRP

Ripple XRP is another ‘utility’ coin. Its blockchain platform is set up to facilitate cross-border transfers of fiat currency more efficiently. Closely connected to and supported by several banks from its beginning, Ripple XRP is often regarded as the ‘establishment’ cryptocurrency. The number of transfer services using Ripple’s platform has gradually grown over the years and there is a genuine possibility that it will become part of the traditional financial system.

Litecoin

Litecoin is another potential fiat alternative and a prominent rival for Bitcoin. Its creators hope Litecoin will eventually be used to pay for everyday goods and services. Litecoin has positioned itself as a more practical and technologically superior alternative to Bitcoin. Litecoin transactions can be confirmed by the P2P network significantly quicker than Bitcoin transactions. In theory, this could make Litecoin more attractive for merchants, but with ‘real-life’ cryptocurrency transactions still hugely limited, Bitcoin’s more established ‘brand’ keeps it well out in front as the fiat alternative cryptocurrency of choice.

NEO

Like Ethereum, NEO is a smart contract and Dapps platform. Released in 2014, NEO’s ambition was to improve upon Ethereum by offering approximately the same utility through a technologically more sophisticated example of blockchain technology. Many argue NEO is the technically superior platform to Ethereum but, as is the case with Litecoin and Bitcoin, the latter’s more established position has helped it maintain a larger market share.

IOTA

IOTA is a unique cryptocurrency that is based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, created to work with Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT facilitates feeless microtransactions involving connected devices, and it also helps maintain their data integrity. More recently, IOTA jumped to the top of the list of most traded cryptocurrencies and appears to have a big future, with IoT technology becoming the standard.

Tether

Tether is a cryptocurrency with tokens issued by Tether Limited, which in turn is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. Tether is called a stable coin because it was originally designed to always be worth $1.00, maintaining $1.00 in reserves for each tether issued.

Cardano

Cardano is a public blockchain platform. It is open-source and decentralized, with consensus achieved using proof of stake. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its internal cryptocurrency, Ada. Cardano was founded in 2015 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson.

Dogecoin

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a joke, making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time. Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment prospect.

Binance coin

Binance coin is the cryptocurrency issued by Binance exchange and trades with the BNB symbol. Binance coin initially ran on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC 20 standard but has since become the native coin of the Binance chain. Binance coin has a strict maximum of 200 million BNB tokens.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-10-most-purchased-cryptocurrencies-in-August-2021.jpg',)",none
2021-08-16,Cointelegraph,Microsoft wants to use Ethereum blockchain to fight piracy,https://cointelegraph.com/news/microsoft-wants-to-use-ethereum-blockchain-to-fight-piracy,"Windows operating system and Office productivity suite have always been top performers on any software piracy platforms. So, it’s no wonder that Microsoft, the developer of both products, works hard to establish anti-piracy measures.

In a new paper released by Microsoft’s research department, with the participation of researchers from Alibaba and Carnegie Mellon University, the Redmond-based software giant studied a blockchain-based incentive system to bolster anti-piracy campaigns.

As the title of the research, “Argus: A Fully Transparent Incentive System for Anti-Piracy Campaigns,” suggests, Microsoft’s new system relies on the transparency aspect of blockchain technology. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Argus aims to provide a trustless incentive mechanism while protecting data collected from the open anonymous population of piracy reporters.

“We see this as a distributed system problem,” the paper stated, “In the implementation, we overcome a set of unavoidable obstacles to ensure security despite full transparency.”

Argus enables backtracing of pirated content to the source with a corresponding watermark algorithm, which is detailed in the paper. Also named “proof of leakage,” each report of leaked content involves an information-hiding procedure. This way, no one but the informer can report the same watermarked copy without actually owning it.

The system also has incentive-reducing safeguards to prevent an informer from reporting the same leaked content over and over under different aliases. “With the security and practicality of Argus, we hope real-world antipiracy campaigns will be truly effective by shifting to a fully transparent incentive mechanism,” the report stated.

Detailing the issue of Ethereum network fees, the paper explained that the team optimized several cryptographic operations “so that the cost for piracy reporting is reduced to an equivalent cost of sending about 14 ETH-transfer transactions to run on the public Ethereum network, which would otherwise correspond to thousands of transactions.”

Tech companies worldwide have become increasingly concerned with protecting intellectual property and fighting digital piracy. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Tech Mahindra, the IT subsidiary of Indian conglomerate Mahindra Group, recently launched a new blockchain-based digital contracts and rights platform on Hyperledger Fabric protocol for the media and entertainment industry.","('https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDgvYmMxNzQ5ZWMtMTVjZS00Zjk4LTliYmYtMjI1NGZkYWE1OWYxLmpwZw==.jpg',)",none
2021-08-16,News.com.au,Cryptocurrency market hits $2 trillion amid bitcoin price gains,https://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/world-markets/cryptocurrency-passes-massive-us2-trillion-milestone/news-story/1c7a012843f5bcd638ebd7836eb7a0c2,"Cryptocurrency passed a major milestone in market capitalisation – but it remains to be seen whether it will stay that way.

Cryptocurrency passed a major milestone over the weekend when it reached a market capitalisation of a staggering $US2 trillion ($A2.7 trillion) for the second time in a row.

CoinGecko tracks 8884 cryptocurrency coins and found that between them, they were now worth $2,108,466,906,329 ($A2.8 trillion) at time of writing.

That means in total, those 8884 types of cryptocurrency are worth more than $2 trillion.

The $2 trillion marker is a huge achievement considering that the world’s first ever decentralised cryptocurrency, bitcoin, launched in 2009 with a single coin selling for less than a cent.

It’s not the first time the digital currency has surged past $2 trillion. In April, when cryptocurrency peaked to its highest ever levels, it reached the 12-digit number – before dropping dramatically.

A huge chunk of cryptocurrency’s market cap is thanks to bitcoin, which surged on the weekend to its highest level since its all-time high back in May.

Bitcoin reached $US48,152 ($A65,439) but was down to $US47,526 ($A64,639) on Monday.

It has a market capitalisation of $US894 billion ($A1.2 trillion) – so makes up a little under half of cryptocurrency’s total worth.

Major players in digital coin world

There are more than 8000 types of cryptocurrency on the market. Apart from bitcoin, some others have made significant contributions to the $US2 trillion market capitalisation.

Ethereum is the second most valuable crypto token, worth $US3290 ($A4484) per coin, with a market capitalisation of $US387 billion ($A526 billion) at time of writing.

Ethereum first started trading in 2015 with a single coin worth just $A3.76.

Cardano is now the third most valuable cryptocurrency,

Over the last week, cardano surged 47 per cent.

In that same period of time, binance coin rose by 14 per cent, XRP by 61 per cent and dogecoin by 18 per cent, according to CoinGecko.

This is the second time crypto has surged past the $US2 trillion milestone.

So far, it seems to be holding, well into the trillions by mid-Monday.

On April 6 this year, the crypto market cap reached $US2.02 trillion.

Bitcoin then reached its all-time high on May 16 of around $US50,000 ($A68,000).

However, prices started dropping after that.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4718adb30a4c69a3383df152f47c4977',)",none
2021-08-16,Gadgets 360,"Can You Convert Cryptocurrency Into Cash? Yes, Here's How",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/convert-cryptocurrency-into-cash-explained-how-to-2511389,"Cryptocurrency is now a popular investment option for younger people but you can't exactly spend your crypto in order to pay for your dinner. Well, you can if you want to choose from a few limited options (as big businesses get on board) but for the most part, people still need to convert their crypto into cash. The good news is that this is very easy to do. Having said that, there are several factors an individual might want to consider before converting their cryptocurrency into cash. Digital tokens are extremely volatile and their values fluctuate a lot so if your timing is wrong you potentially stand to lose money. On the other hand, a risk-averse investor, seeing the uncertainty around digital currencies, might consider converting their digital money to fiat currency.

Either way, here's what you need to know about converting your cryptocurrency into cash. Just remember that if you cash out, then you will need to pay taxes on your profits — although crypto currently exists in a legal grey area in India, that's not to say that gains made from investing in this asset are outside the ambit of taxes.

How to convert your crypto into cash?

Let's understand this by taking Bitcoin as an example of a cryptocurrency that you want to convert into cash. Remember to keep in mind that converting any cryptocurrency into cash will involve taxation as well an exchange fee that a third-party broker will levy depending on the number of digital tokens. Not to forget, a third-party broker may take a day or two to transfer the money to your bank account. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.53 lakhs as of 10am IST on August 16.

Now let's come to converting cryptocurrency into cash. There are two ways of doing it.

Through an exchange or broker

This is similar to the currency exchange system at airports. Once you deposit your digital currency to exchange and request for withdrawal, the broker will transfer the money to your bank account.

However, since there are money laundering restrictions on brokers, you have to withdraw your money through the same bank account that you made a deposit with.

The biggest disadvantage with this method of conversion is the time it takes. Experts say it's safe and secure, but it takes time for the money to reflect in your bank account. The exchange also charges a fee for the transaction, and it varies from broker to broker and country to country.

Through an exchange or broker

Considered a quicker and more anonymous method, an individual can use a peer-to-peer platform to convert their digital currency into cash by simply selling it. The other advantages include a smaller fee and the possibility of a better exchange rate compared to a third-party brokerage. Having said that, you have got to be careful of fraudsters.

It's recommended that you ask for proof of ID and payment before releasing your cryptocurrency.

You can also use a peer-to-peer platform that keeps your digital tokens locked until your bank account is credited with the money.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/cryptocurrency_red_reuters_1626854224702.jpg',)",none
2021-08-16,Gadgets 360,What Is Cryptocurrency Mining? How Can You Do It?,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/what-is-cryptocurrency-mining-how-to-2511378,"Have you wondered what mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies involve, and how you can get yourself some crypto tokens without having to buy them at an exchange? The rapid increase in the prices of crypto coins like Bitcoin, Ether, and Dogecoin in the first half of this year led to many people wanting to get involved in the crypto ecosystem. While most people buy and sell them through exchanges, it's also possible (though in some cases, like Bitcoin today, very time consuming) to 'mine' these tokens by using your computer to solve complex mathematical equations. Here's how it works, and how you can mine your tokens.

Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and most other cryptocurrencies are built using a technology called Blockchain, which is the public ledger, that is is secured using complex encryption techniques. Getting new coins on the ledger involves solving complex mathematical puzzles that help verify virtual currency transactions. These are then updated on the decentralised blockchain ledger. In return for this work, the miners get paid with cryptocurrency. This process is called mining as it lets new coins into circulation. Thus, miners are an essential part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.53 lakhs while Ethereum price in India stood at Rs. 2.53 lakhs and Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs. 26 as of 11am IST on August 16.

How does mining work?

During mining, computers solve complex mathematical equations. The first coder to crack each code is able to authorise the transaction. In return for the service, the miner earns small amounts of cryptocurrency. Once the miner successfully solves the mathematical problem and verifies the transaction, they add the data to the public ledger, called the blockchain.

Proof of work

This is the algorithm that secures several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. It ensures that no single authority becomes so powerful that it begins to run the show. This process executed by miners is a necessary part of adding new blocks of transaction data to the blockchain. A new block is only added to the blockchain system if a miner comes up with a new winning proof-of-work. This happens after every 10 minutes in the network. The goal of proof-of-work is to prevent users from printing extra coins they didn't earn, or double-spending.

Why is it expensive to mine tokens?

In the early days, soon after Bitcoin came into existence in 2009, it was a profitable activity. At the time, miners would get 50 BTC (then worth $6,000) for solving each equation. Since the resources required to mine a single bitcoin were also less, miners were able to pocket most of the reward as pure profit. Although the reward for Bitcoin mining has decreased over time, the value of each BTC has increased hugely. As of April 2021, the value of a Bitcoin reward is nearly $3,33,000 (roughly Rs. 2.47 crores).

But the cost of Bitcoin mining has increased dramatically. This is because the competition for tokens is much higher, and high-performance computing is now required to successfully mine the tokens. As a result, the cost of the energy consumed in this process could be huge depending on the miner's location and the type of hardware they use.

How can you start mining?

First, get a high-performance computer. Then create a wallet for Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies. Once that is done, join a mining pool to maximise profitability. These pools are groups of miners who combine their resources to increase their mining power. The profit generated from mining is then distributed evenly to all members in the pool. Mining pools allow individuals to work together and compete more effectively.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_profund_bloomberg_1627542936069.jpg',)",none

“Bitcoin continues above its critical 200-day moving average,” Fundstrat strategists wrote in a note Friday. “Also on our radar is Cardano (ADA), which after signaling smart contracts are soon to hit the platform earlier this week is up” significantly.

The moves higher came even after the cryptocurrency industry failed to win a change to crypto tax reporting rules in a US infrastructure bill, leaving intact language for broad oversight of virtual currencies in the legislation that passed the Senate on Tuesday.

2021-08-16,Gadgets 360,"Understanding Crypto: Money - Past, Present, and Future",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/opinion/understanding-cryptocurrency-future-of-money-past-and-present-2509861,"What is the future of money? Thousands of years ago, our ancestors used to barter or swap food, hunting gear, and cattle. And now Uniswap, the world's most popular crypto swapping and bartering protocol, has generated a billion dollars in fees! Money has come a full circle. Welcome to the first edition of this “zero BS” weekly column on future money and crypto. Today we discuss the past, present, and future of money.

We spend most of our time in an endless race to earn money. But many of us don't know what money actually is.

1. The past

Our ancestors started off with the barter system - something like ""I will give you two buffaloes in return for five shiny new, super-sharp axes"". Soon they realised that the barter system had too many limitations:

everyone didn't want buffaloes,

buffaloes were not divisible (not too many people would want 0.35 buffaloes)

buffaloes were not portable (imagine having to carry a buffalo on your shoulders while going shopping!).

So they moved on to more acceptable, divisible, homogeneous, and portable forms of money - cowry shells, salt, gold, silver, and lots more.

The Chinese invention of paper eventually led to the birth of paper currency, which was initially backed by gold or other precious metals. The United States dollar was on the gold standard for many years. That means the dollar was backed by gold. This ended on June 5, 1933.

Posters to announce the end of the Gold standard

The US government continued to convert dollars to gold at a fixed value until August 15, 1971.

Today, the entire world has moved on to fiat money - currency that's declared as legal tender by a government but not backed by a physical commodity.

Have a look at an Indian note (anything except a 1-rupee note). It carries a promise signed by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) :

“I promise to pay the bearer the sum of one hundred rupees”.

If you were to take this note to the Governor of the RBI, he would (probably) give you coins or one-rupee notes. (Disclaimer: I haven't tried it!)

These bank notes issued by the RBI can be used as ""legal tender"" in India. That means everyone must accept them for all legal payments. Remember the demonetisation of some notes in India in 2016? Well, legally speaking, this is what happened: the ""legal tender status"" of the then Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 bank notes was withdrawn.

2. The present

The birth of computers and the Internet has brought in many innovative payment systems such as debit & credit cards, net-banking, mobile wallets, UPI, etc.

The cryptocurrency revolution started with Satoshi Nakamoto's path-breaking whitepaper - ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" in October 2008. This brought the world Bitcoin, the first truly peer-to-peer electronic currency. Today, there are almost 6,000 actively traded cryptocurrencies!

These cryptocurrencies are of many types — medium-of-exchange coins, stablecoins, utility coins, privacy coins, meme coins, NFTs, etc.

There are also use case specific cryptos which are disrupting sectors like e-commerce, education, data storage, gaming, marketing, media, supply chain, video streaming and lots lots more.

Do you know that there is a crypto project called Basic Attention Token (BAT) that is monetising human attention? Yes, that's right, human attention! I will cover this in a future edition.

3. The future

According to me, money must have at least 1 of the following characteristics:

I should be able to buy and sell stuff using it

I should be able to maintain my accounts using it

I should be able to hold and grow my savings with it

Money is not just cash and bank deposits. It includes so much more - art, cryptocurrencies, equity shares, gold real estate, loyalty points, etc.

Let's say I have a great idea for a startup. But I don't have the cash to hire a good team. I could pay them using shares of my startup. I could also give them ESOPs (employee stock options). If my startup succeeds, my team would be able to sell their shares at a huge profit.

This is what I believe the future of money will look like:

2021-08-16,Cointelegraph,"Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, ETC, LUNA, KLAY, AXS",https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-etc-luna-klay-axs,"Bitcoin (BTC) is facing a stiff challenge from the bears near the $48,000 mark. As Cointelegraph reported earlier, the buy and sell levels show that sellers on Binance have held their ground at $48,000.

PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price model, said that if Bitcoin manages to close August above $47,000, the year-end ""worst-case scenario"" target price of $135,000 may come into play.

Despite the slight downturn, the institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to increase. Filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission show that four wealth management firms have bought shares in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust.

A survey of about 42,000 people in 27 countries by product comparison website Finder showed a high adoption rate in Asia. Among the countries polled, Vietnam had the highest adoption rate at 41%, while India and Indonesia had a 30% adoption rate.

Compared to their Asian counterparts, the respondents in the United Kingdom and the United States reported a low 8% and 9% adoption rate. However, the report warned that “Due to the varying Google infrastructure in each territory, not all surveys were nationally representative.”

Will Bitcoin’s hesitation near the $48,000 mark result in profit-booking? Could altcoins attract funds that exit Bitcoin? Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may extend their up-move in the next few days.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin (BTC) turned down from the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern on Aug. 14. This suggests that the bears have not given up and are defending the resistance line aggressively.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The BTC/USDT pair could now drop to the support line of the wedge, which could attract buyers. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to resume the up-move. A breakout and close above the wedge will invalidate the bearish pattern and open the doors for a rally to $53,000 and then $60,000.

The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive zone suggest that bulls are in control.

Contrary to this assumption, if bears sink the price below the wedge, the pair could drop to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $42,682. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the up-move.

But if the price slips below the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $37,176.

The bears are posing a stiff challenge in the zone between $46,743.47 and $48,144. They have pulled the price down to the 50-day SMA on the four-hour chart. If the price breaks below this support, the pair could drop to $43,770 and later to $42,451.67.

The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the bullish momentum may be weakening.

If the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the overhead resistance zone, it will indicate that bulls are buying on every minor dip. That will suggest the resumption of the up-move.

ETC/USDT

Ethereum Classic (ETC) broke and closed above the overhead resistance at $63.56 on Aug. 13, completing an ascending triangle pattern. This bullish setup has a pattern target of $94.91.

ETC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Usually, after breaking out of a pattern, the price turns down and retests the breakout level. In this case, the ETC/USDT pair could retest the $63.56 level in the next few days. If bulls flip this level into support, the pair could start a new uptrend.

The rising 20-day EMA ($57) and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand. If the price breaks below $63.56, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA.

A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest that the bullish sentiment remains intact. The buyers will then make one more attempt to resume the up-move. This positive view will be negated if bears pull the price below the 20-day EMA. That could result in a decline to the 50-day SMA ($51).

The 4-hour chart shows that the pair is in an uptrend. The bears are attempting to stall the up-move at $76.16 but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory indicate advantage to the buyers.

If bulls propel the price above $76.16, the next stop could be $84.16. On the contrary, if bears sink the price below $70, the pair could decline to the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce off this level will suggest that the sentiment remains positive but a break below it may pull the price down to $63.56.

LUNA/USDT

Terra protocol’s LUNA token has been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few days. The breakout and close above the downtrend line suggest the start of a new uptrend.

LUNA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears have been defending the overhead resistance at $18 for the past four days. If the price rises from the current level or rebounds off the support line, the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the LUNA/USDT pair above $18. If they manage to do that, the next stop could be $19.54 and then $22.

Alternatively, if the price breaks below the channel and the 20-day EMA ($14), it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened. The pair could then retest the breakout level at the downtrend line.

The bears have twice stalled the up-move at $18, which makes it an important level to watch out for. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is just above 50, which points to a possible consolidation in the near term.

If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the pair could trade between $15.81 and $18 for some time. A breakout and close above $18 could start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $20.81. Conversely, a break below $15 may signal the start of a deeper correction to $13.

KLAY/USDT

Klaytn (KLAY) rose above the $1.81 resistance on Aug. 14, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The long wick on the candlestick of the past two days suggests that bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance.

KLAY/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought zone, indicating the possibility of a minor correction or consolidation in the next few days. Any dip is likely to find support at $1.60 and then at $1.40.

If the price rebounds off either support, the bulls will make one more attempt to rise above $1.81. A breakout and close above this level will complete a rounding bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $2.90.

This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($1.32). That could result in a decline to the 50-day SMA ($1.07).

The four-hour chart shows that bears thwarted two attempts by the bulls to push the price above the $1.81 resistance. If bears sustain their selling pressure and sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the decline could extend to the 50-day SMA.

Conversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to clear the hurdle at $1.81. If they succeed, the KLAY/USDT pair could rally to $2.18. The rising moving averages and the fact that the RSI is in the positive zone indicate an advantage to the bulls.

AXS/USD

Axie Infinity's native token, Axie Infinity Shards (AXS), has been in a strong bull run in the past few weeks, hitting a new all-time high at $77.48 on Aug. 11. The long wick on the day’s candlestick showed that traders booked profits at higher levels.

AXS/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The AXS/USDT pair has corrected to the immediate support at $63. If bears sink the price below this level, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($51). The previous two corrections reversed direction from the 20-day EMA.

Therefore, the bulls are again likely to buy the dip to the 20-day EMA. A strong rebound off this level will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying the dips. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend.

A breakout and close above $77.48 could clear the path for a possible run to $91 and then to psychological resistance at $100. Alternatively, a breakdown and close below the 20-day EMA may signal the start of a deeper correction.

The four-hour chart shows the formation of a descending triangle pattern, which will complete a breakdown and close below the support at $63. This reversal setup has a pattern target of $48.52. The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint indicate that the bullish momentum is weakening.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price rises from the current level and breaks above the downtrend line, it will invalidate the bearish setup. That could increase the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $77.48.

2021-08-16,CNN,"State Department tries to 'push the envelope' with Dark Web informants, cryptocurrency rewards in the millions",https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/15/politics/state-department-dark-web-cryptocurrency-rewards/index.html,"(CNN) As hackers and cybersecurity experts descended on Las Vegas last week for the famous cyber conference Black Hat, they may have noticed an open Wi-Fi network called ""#Rewardsnotransoms."" It's not the kind of place where a network is usually left unprotected but, in this case, that was the point.

Logging in, or scanning the QR code on T-shirts and flyers also being handed out on the convention floor, took attendees to a page for the State Department's new initiative offering up to $10 million to informants with information on state-backed hackers.

The Rewards for Justice table at the Black Hat Cyber Conference in Las Vegas promoting the launch of the new cryptocurrency reward.

The Vegas push was made to such a highly targeted cyber audience because for the first time in the Reward for Justice program's almost four decades, informants could elect to receive payments in cryptocurrency and reach out to the US government with sensitive information through a secure portal on the Dark Web. It came after the State Department quietly made the announcement last month amid a flurry of other actions taken by the Biden administration to shore up the country's cybersecurity.

""Within our program there's a tremendous amount of enthusiasm because we're really pushing the envelope every chance we get to try and reach audiences, sources, people who may have information that helps improve our national security,"" a State Department official said in an interview, the first since the announcement was made. ""It's been edgy for some government agencies, perhaps, but we're going to keep pushing forward in many different ways.""

In the past few months, the Biden administration has accused hackers employed by both Russia and China of breaching multiple US government agencies and departments. The goal of RFJ's new reward is to solicit helpful information from the type of hackers who might know people involved in operations like these. State-backed attackers who target protected computers like those used by the US government, financial services and a variety infrastructure sectors are in RFJ's crosshairs.

""Something on the Dark Web that allows total anonymity and an initial level of security is probably more appropriate for those folks,"" said a second official from the State Department, which declined to allow the officials' comments to be on the record. ""So just finding people where they are and reaching them with the technology on which they are most comfortable, I think, is the name of the game for Rewards for Justice.""

The new cryptocurrency reward offer, from a program typically associated with rewards for terrorists, says that up to $10 million can be paid for the identification or location of a state-backed hacker attacking US government systems and critical infrastructure like water, power or transportation. (The highest reward RFJ offers is $25 million for the head of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who may be dead.)

The spate of recent cyberattacks and the Biden administration's vocal response to them were not what drove the new cryptocurrency reward, the State Department said. Instead, the administration's growing focus on the country's cybersecurity was fortuitous timing for RFJ.

""We've been working on this quite a while and it coincided at a very good time that we managed to get this rolled out as critical infrastructure and ransomware were at the top of the news cycle, so to speak, and a major concern for the US government,"" said the first official, who is from the Diplomatic Security Service which oversees RFJ.

Dark Web tips

The RFJ channel can be accessed using Tor, the most common browser for the Dark Web, which is a hidden part of the internet that regular search engines don't see. Accessing the Dark Web with Tor allows users to be anonymous. In the weeks since the channel opened up, tips about malicious cyber actors have already come in, the officials said. They declined to say how many or describe them because of the sensitivity of the information and sources, adding that it's too early to say whether they'll lead to anything.

""This is not a quick process. We are receiving tips. We are evaluating tips. We'll share those tips with the interagency partners. They must then use that information and reach out and begin their investigation,"" one official said. ""This is a longer-term process.""

The US government has already had success with information it has received on the Dark Web. In 2019, the Central Intelligence Agency rolled out its own onion site -- as sites on the Tor network are known -- for both recruiting and receiving tips, recognizing it needed to be present in areas where people felt safer reaching out.

In the two years since the site was launched, the CIA has gotten a wide variety of tips, including about terrorism plots, a US official told CNN.

""The CIA has received validated information about terrorist networks and attack planning, intelligence matters, cyber and technology issues, and crime, among other areas,"" the official said.

Information received can then be corroborated with existing intelligence data or can be used to further validate intelligence already obtained.

Now, the State Department is jockeying to become a centralized clearinghouse for information that people are trying to get to the US government. The global visibility of RFJ around the world and on the ground, in dozens of different languages, helps cement its position, the State Department officials said, as ""an interlocutor to get information to our national security partners.""

""I would like to think in the coming months and years we will have developed such an efficient and successful process that our partners in the National Security Council will come to see us as one of the most effective and reliable ways to obtain information on the national security threats that they are trying to thwart. Period,"" the other official said.

Congress gave RFJ the authority to hand out rewards on cyber issues in 2017 and since then they have advertised two specific rewards pertaining to North Korean cybercrime and foreign cyber election interference. The new reward applies only to state-backed actors, so not the criminal hackers whose recent major attacks have caused gas pipelines and food processing plants to shut down.

Cryptocurrency payments reflect the changing times and join a list of different types of payment that can be made.

'Suitcases full of cash'

""We provide wire transfers, we actually can still deliver -- and do deliver - suitcases full of cash, we can provide in-kind rewards"" the Diplomatic Security official said. And a now a recipient will be able to choose whichever cryptocurrency they like.

Often, the second official said, it's not even about the money.

""A disproportionate amount of our sources are probably not even people that RFJ are paying but nevertheless might lead to positive national security outcomes for our partners,"" this official said.

The State Department's foray into cryptocurrency is certainly the most public the US government has ever made, but it has been used before, according to Bill Evanina, CEO of The Evanina Group who retired this year as Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center after three decades at the FBI and CIA.

""My knowledge of that would be more in the super classified realm,"" Evanina said, declining to say more.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, the CIA and FBI all declined to comment on how the intelligence community and law enforcement have used cryptocurrency.

""It is inconceivable that the government has not used cryptocurrency to paid undercover informants or sources,"" said Erez Liebermann, a former Department of Justice cybercrimes prosecutor.

'Money's still king'

The mainstreaming effect of the government's public use of cryptocurrency for payments is welcome news for cryptocurrency advocates.

""We have long suspected that law enforcement agencies were taking advantage of the properties of cryptocurrencies,"" said Neeraj Agrawal at Coin Center, a Washington think tank that advocates for cryptocurrency. ""It is great to see the administration recognizes the role that cryptocurrencies can play in promoting activism.""

Experts who analyze and engage with malicious cyber actors say it remains to be seen whether a potential windfall of millions will resonate with those inclined to inform on sophisticated hackers employed by powerful countries like China and Russia. They could be afraid of the states they work for coming down on them or be wary of the US government's ability to trace the payments.

""They say there's no honor among thieves. You would still get, I think, good leads,"" said Chris Painter, who was the State Department's first top cyber diplomat and is co-chair of the Ransomware Task Force, a collaboration of public and private sector groups. ""If [informants] can do it anonymously and they get paid anonymously, even if they're quasi state-sponsored, they might just do it. Because money's still king.""

As secure as cryptocurrency is perceived to be, the Biden administration has made clear that tracking it is a top priority to fight ransomware. The FBI recently retrieved more than $2 million in Bitcoin they say was from the ransom Colonial Pipeline paid to the group DarkSide, whose attack prompted the shutdown of the key East coast pipeline in May.

More reward offers coming

""Will potential informants have confidence that their anonymity will be protected?"" Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow asked. ""Any potential informants are also cybercriminals and may only rat if they're confident they can do so safely.""

Still, the simple fact that something new is being tried should be celebrated, said both Painter and Cameron Burks, a former chief of staff at the Diplomatic Security Service.

""I always felt the RFJ program could do a lot more,"" Burks said, ""and this initiative, I think, really demonstrates a forward leaning innovative commitment to going after bad guys, I think, will pay dividends. I'm super proud to see it.""

""I really was surprised,"" Burks added, ""because of government grind, trying to do something as forward leaning as this.""

More reward offers on cybersecurity can be expected ""very soon,"" the State Department officials said, and the use of cryptocurrency is also expected to expand.

""This program is evolving,"" one official said. ""I think this offer of cryptocurrency is something that we will be using in the future for other types of rewards. It could encourage other types of sources to come to us with information who may not have wanted to come to us before.""","('https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210811141959-02-rewards-not-ransoms-super-tease.jpg',)",none

Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban's claim that dogecoin is the strongest cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange has been backed up by long-time doge fan Elon Musk.

Cuban told CNBC last week that ""the community for doge is the strongest when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange.""

In response to CNBC's article about Cuban's claims, Tesla boss Musk tweeted on Saturday: ""I've been saying this for a while.""

Both celebrity businessmen have been drawn to dogecoin for its light-hearted nature and strong community - and have been important to its 8,000% gain over the last year.

However, cryptocurrency skeptics struggle to see what Musk and Cuban see in dogecoin, which is highly volatile and more complicated to use for purchases than mainstream payment methods.

""It's a medium that can be used for the acquisition of goods and services,"" Cuban told CNBC. ""The community for doge is the strongest when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange.""

Musk has long supported dogecoin - a meme cryptocurrency that was started as a joke in 2013.

After halting Tesla's acceptance of bitcoin in May, Musk said he was working with dogecoin developers to improve the cryptocurrency network's transaction efficiency - although there has so far been no more details about his progress.

Musk's comment on Saturday appeared to reassure doge fans that the Tesla boss still supports the coin, which was trading 6.4% higher on Sunday at $0.2968.","('https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/85349880/elon-musk-backs-mark-cubans-claim-that-dogecoin-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-as-a-medium-of-exchange.jpg?imgsize=330695',)",none
2021-08-16,NDTV.com,How To Trade In Cryptocurrency? Here Are Some Beginners' Tips,https://www.ndtv.com/business/how-to-trade-in-cryptocurrency-here-are-some-beginners-tips-2510952,"It is important to tread cautiously while investing in cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrency is a relatively new concept in India and transacting in it is not exactly common knowledge. Yet people have been jumping on to the crypto bandwagon, mainly because of good returns which it guarantees.

Unlike trading in shares and debentures, which is governed by bodies like the Reserve Bank of India and Securities and Exchange Board of India, that safeguard the interest of investors, dealing in cryptocurrency is free from any third party control.

All transactions and operations under the crypto market are controlled and governed by the crypto community itself. Also while returns on investment in cryptocurrencies are high, the market is highly volatile and transactions once initiated, cannot be reversed.

Therefore before putting in your money in the crypto market, do go through the following tips:

It is important to first select a trading platform or the right crypto exchange. A crypto exchange is just like the stock market. There are several crypto trading platforms in India like WazirX, Coin DCX and CoinSwitch Kuber among others. A first time investor can choose from any of these to begin crypto trading.

Once a trading platform has been identified, an investor has to upload all the required documents online on the exchange to complete the KYC (know your customer) process.

After the KYC process is completed and all the required documents are verified by the concerned crypto exchange, an investor can begin trading in cryptocurrency. Crypto exchanges function 24 hours round the clock and don't have opening or closing hours like normal stock exchanges.

An investor can either store the crypto currency in a digital wallet or can withdraw it in the form of money.

To begin with, one cryptocurrency should be chosen at a time as the market is quite volatile and it is important to tread with caution before expanding one's portfolio.

Adhering to experts' opinions is very important before expanding one's investment in cryptocurrency. Therefore one should always begin with small investments and study the market carefully instead of blindly following anybody's advise.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/jnqec5do_cryptocurrency_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-08-16,Analytics Insight,Can Gold Be An Answer To Fight Back Extreme Volatility in Cryptocurrency Market?,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/can-gold-be-an-answer-to-fight-back-extreme-volatility-in-cryptocurrency-market/,"Can Gold Be An Answer To Fight Back Extreme Volatility in Cryptocurrency Market?

No wonder, the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile. Every possible effort is being put in on futuristic products and protocols in order to mitigate this extreme volatility. Let’s talk about the most famous cryptocurrency and also the current favorite of many – Bitcoin. The fact that this digital currency comes with no physical backing of value draws all the criticism. Contrary to how fiat currencies are pegged to a stable asset, cryptocurrencies aren’t. Blockchain technology deserves all the credit for being the major contributor to the popularity of cryptocurrencies. Gone are the days when Blockchain technology was limited to mere trading. Today, this technology has made a lot of industries rely on it for several purposes.

Talking about how promising the cryptocurrency market has been for the investors, both in terms of volume and value, in the last couple of years needs no special mention. Yes, people made huge profits by virtue of the rising demand for cryptocurrencies but the fact that there have been bad days too wherein the market bled badly cannot be overlooked as well.

As far as gold is considered – let’s start by throwing light on the world’s reserve currency, USD. Not known to many but the USD has been backed by gold for a good period of time. Though the demand and popularity of cryptocurrencies overshadowed the performance of gold, what is worth a mention is that gold has had its unique way of standing apart from the rest. It has been a silent performer all this while. Contrary to how cryptocurrencies get impacted as a result of tweets pertaining to crypto and inflation for fiat currencies, gold is relatively on the safer side – thanks to the fact that there are negligible factors that can disrupt the value of gold. Its consistency, ability to beat inflation by a fair margin, and high liquidity among others are the reasons why gold is considered to be an ideal commodity for cryptocurrencies to be pegged to.

Let’s now talk about – Can gold be an answer to fight back the extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency market?

The regulatory uncertainties have always been a cause of concern for cryptocurrencies. But with gold being a universal asset, an opportunity to ease the acceptance of cryptocurrencies opens up. As fiat currencies have to fight inflation every now and then, no second thoughts about how well the gold-backed crypto can be the new medium of exchange for institutions. Addressing the issue of scarce knowledge pertaining to the cryptocurrency market, the gold-backed cryptocurrency is a step to ensure that the participants entering the market are knowledgeable about their investments.

Not only will the cryptocurrencies enjoy liquidity, benefits of security and transparency can also be reaped in, thanks to blockchain technology. The minimal fluctuation in the price of gold is yet another reason why such an investment would be worth it all. The ability of gold to hold its value even during recessions and economic failures when combined with cryptocurrencies would result in a combination of stability and accessibility.

All in all, the coexistence of gold and crypto could be an excellent way to mitigate extreme volatility.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency-vs-Gold.jpeg',)",none

Blockdata compiled a list of the 13 banks that have invested the most in cryptocurrency and blockchain companies to date.

Coinbase, Ripple, and NYDIG have landed financial backing from big banks.

55% of the world's top 100 banks are investing in the crypto and blockchain space.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Financial institutions are grabbing for a piece of the booming $2 trillion cryptocurrency market, with 13 of the world's largest banks pushing roughly $3 billion in funding so far into cryptocurrency and blockchain companies, according to analytics company Blockdata.

The data firm in an updated report this week published a list of 13 banks that lead in terms of size of funding rounds as a proxy of investment into the crypto space, saying it used that measure as banks participated in funding rounds with multiple or many other investors.

London-based Standard Chartered leads the list with $380 million in valuation of the funding rounds in which it participated while its London-based rival Barclays ranked as the most active investor based on the number of investments in blockchain companies.

Blockdata found that 55% of the world's 100 biggest banks by assets under management are investing directly or indirectly in companies and projects related to digital currencies and blockchain.

Here's the list of the top 13 banks in terms of size of funding rounds as a proxy of investment:

2021-08-16,The Economic Times,"Bitcoin, Dogecoin or something else?",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-dogecoin-or-something-else/articleshow/85344392.cms,"Time is everything in the investment world. Whether it is timing the market or the time spent in the market, it plays an important role. Coming to whether it is a good time to hold an investment in Bitcoin and Dogecoin , let’s analyse the difference between the two cryptocurrencies Bitcoin was created in the aftermath of the 2008 economic recession by an anonymous user named Satoshi Nakamoto. It is scarce by its design, philosophy, and nature. We can only have 21 million Bitcoin, not more or less than that. Today, there is already 18.7 million Bitcoin in circulation and by 2140 all the 21 million Bitcoins are expected to be mined.On the other hand, 10,000 new Dogecoin are created at every block at the rate of roughly one block per minute. That is nearly 15 million Dogecoin being created every day, making it an infinite supply with more than 130.54 billion already in circulation.When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, he/she/they knew exactly what they were creating. The first peer-to-peer electronic cash system was created as an alternative to an inefficient, trust-based monetary system. Bitcoin, by all means, satisfied the criteria of a monetary system. It’s a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a transferable asset. The core idea is that money should be globally accessible, which anyone can buy, sell, store anywhere in the world.On the other hand, Dogecoin was created by software engineer Billy Markus as a joke. It just took about three hours to make it, forking from the available Bitcoin source code.While both Bitcoin and Dogecoin have a great community, the essence of community in Bitcoin is very different from that of Dogecoin. Bitcoin has been around for more than 12 years, and it has stood the test of time. Most of the Bitcoin owners are well informed about the technology and philosophy of the Bitcoin concept. Mostly, they are the ones who challenge the status quo and advocate for the technology that offers distributed open-source, decentralised monetary systems.While the Dogecoin community is growing fast, that growth is credited to hype and trends. People with no understanding of the market want to take doge to $10, $100 and so on, which is realistically impossible. Lifestyle celebrities with no basic understanding of technology ask fans to buy doge and influence them, taking the market on a crazy ride.So, is it the right time to hold an investment in Bitcoin and Dogecoin? It is you who decides!But for anyone who has seen the success of Bitcoin since the last decade, it is based on a technology that can change our lives and not just the monetary system. Dogecoin is a baby product of Bitcoin. And most of the coins that have come into the market after Bitcoin have seen the same graph as that of Bitcoin.Dogecoin, if it wants to be popular and rule the crypto world, needs to offer something unique that none of the coins has ever offered to people. It is always better to stop asking questions and take action. There is no right answer.More questions bring more confusion. It is always advisable to take baby steps, early actions and invest what one can afford to lose.Unlike gold, stock, or any other investment assets, Bitcoin is an accumulation game. The asset price is only going up on average and it can be proved by a simple supply-demand theory. The circulating supply of Bitcoin is getting lesser and lesser and there are already more than 100 million Bitcoin owners. With its great fundamental philosophy intact, there is more and more demand which leads to price rise. The recent “The B-Word” virtual Bitcoin event witnessed a discussion between Jack Dorsey, Cathi Wood and Elon Musk. The entire conversation was based on why Bitcoin is taking over the world just like the Internet did three-decade ago and Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, went on to reveal that Tesla, SpaceX and he himself own Bitcoin. The key message here is, big corporations and big whales are accumulating more, leaving behind the retail investors. So, if you are a believer in this technology, the right time to hold a Bitcoin investment is now.While the future prices of any cryptocurrency are not predetermined, any wise investor should know where he/she is putting his/her money. Be it stock, real estate, business, crypto, or any investment, understanding the basic principle and philosophy is crucial. No one can be sure if tomorrow Dogecoin or Bitcoin can go up or down. What we know is about the technology, why, and how these coins were created. Having another cryptocurrency with infinite supply will become another fiat currency just waiting for inflation. Bitcoin may not be the best and far from perfect, but with its core principle intact, having a great community is surely a better bet to take on.(The author, Sathvik Vishwanath is the Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, Unocoin Technologies Pvt Ltd.

2021-08-16,News.com.au,Cryptocurrency or property: Which is the better financial investment,https://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/buying/cryptocurrency-or-property-which-is-the-better-financial-investment/news-story/c7bf00012cce949bf240105c7f2279e9,"Despite having a crypto portfolio worth up to $50,000, one Sydneysider still can’t buy a property as homes sell for $300,000 above the price guide.

Oliver has a cryptocurrency portfolio worth between $40,000 and $50,000 but his quest to become a first homebuyer is proving fruitless, with the Sydneysider saying he has been “blown out of the water” every time he has tried to bid on a place.

It leaves the 26-year-old, who did not want his surname shared, in a curious predicament. With house prices skyrocketing and a portfolio that is performing well, should he switch to focusing on investing and give up his property dream?

“It’s been a long hunt. I have viewed close to 70 homes and bid competitively on 10 and lost every single one. The average I have lost to is $200,000 to $300,000 above the asking price, it’s a bit flattening,” he told news.com.au.

“At 26 we all work hard, everyone works hard with the Aussie dream in mind of having your own property. It’s been something I’ve been working towards since I was 18 or 20 and it seems every weekend I go to houses and it still seems a little bit further away.”

“I lost a property that I thought was amazing that had a price guide of $1.2 million and sold for $1.6 million – the real estate agent would be laughing.”

The software company employee is searching for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with his girlfriend anywhere from Neutral Bay to Chatswood, with a deposit of around 20 to 30 per cent.

His interest in cryptocurrency came about when he was studying economics and he heard stories about people in America buying pizza for 50 bitcoin.

Liking the idea of crypto being a “disruptor to traditional markets”, he decided to jump in.

“It’s a new stock market essentially and there’s that get rich quick mentality that’s comes into it as a 20-year-old where you think maybe one day I can be a billionaire,” he said.

In 2015, he decided to invest close to $10,000 in the first year but is quick to point out that his strategy was to use money that wasn’t crucial to living.

“The great thing about cryptocurrency, unlike the Australian stock exchange, there is not a minimum you need to invest. You can start with $1 and I remember I started with $15,” he said.

Riding crypto’s price highs and lows – he remembers being on holidays and bitcoin peaked at $24,000 before crashing the very next day – hasn’t panicked him as he’s in it for the long haul.

But the Millennial is concerned by a number of people thinking crypto is their ticket to driving a Lamborghini by the time they are 30.

“I think right now if you looked into who is buying cryptocurrency in Australia it’s the younger demographics, everyone from 18 is jumping in there with $50 to $100 and the 25 to 30-year-olds are looking how to boost their savings so they can play in a higher bracket of housing or buy a property,” he said.

“But the fact is it’s unregulated means it fluctuates and you can make a lot of money so there is a big appetite and young Aussies love it but there is a gamified nature to it too. There’s definitely a massive danger in that it’s essentially educated gambling ... but if you look through social media it looks like everyone is getting richer and buying Lamborghinis from cryptocurrency. That’s the danger my generation and the generation below me face as the market continues to grow.”

Cryptocurrency will always be a part of his investment portfolio but he doesn’t want to put all his eggs in such a risky basket, with the dream of home ownership living on.

“A house is a great foundation ... and it’s one asset that will never really lose money not with our population rates and property growth and it’s one of the only assets that doesn’t pay capital gains tax on it as a principal residence,” he said.

Cryptocurrency and residential property are the chalk and cheese of investment, according to financial comparison website Canstar’s group executive and finance expert, Steve Mickenbecker.

“Yet crypto is the current market darling and property the perennial favourite,” he said.

“Residential property has a long established record of steady capital appreciation, though punctuated by booms and corrections, and is at the lower end of the risk scale.

“Crypto has a short life span, in its current forms has limited intrinsic value, and no ongoing cash flow. It is a speculative investment that fluctuates wildly. Yet fortunes have been made from crypto and some will be lost.”

For investors who don’t get enough adrenalin rush from vanilla crpto, they can gear the investment with derivatives – options, CFDs and futures – to heighten the thrill and danger of living on the edge, he said.

“Diversification is a sound general investment principle, and both property and crypto can form a part in a diversified investment portfolio, provided investors understand the risk they are taking and place limits on high risk investments in particular,” he said.

For Fred Schebesta, Finder co-founder, he views cryptocurrency as a more accessible and easier investment to get into compared to the larger commitment of property.

“For crypto, the biggest fear is a big fall in value, but the best thing to do with it is to consider it as a long-term investment and ignore the day-to-day volatility,” he said.

“For property, the worry is that you buy too much and leverage too far and possibly lose your property if interest rates go up.

“Our August research shows that almost 150,000 Australian households would be pushed into financial hardship if their home loan rate increased out of cycle – and that’s with rates at rock-bottom levels.”

Christopher Zinn, from online financial advice platform Life Sherpa also described crypto as unregulated gambling. Picture: Supplied

Christopher Zinn, from online financial advice platform Life Sherpa, said at this stage, crypto can be an unregulated gamble but it is cheaper than buying houses and arguably more fun.

“Some younger Aussies have done very well on the roller coaster ride of cryptos but others have lost their shirts,” he said.

“Buying a house is hard and often heart-breaking work. It’s also very expensive but has the benefit you can live in it too.”

Diversification should be driving your decisions around investments, he advised.

“Winning investment portfolios hold a mixture of shares, bonds and real estate distributed between geographies, currencies, and industries,” he said.

“It’s not just about the number of investments, though. It’s more about the nature of the assets – they need to behave differently as well.”","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/efc3242920d90c028aa60159ffdce6b2',)",none
2021-08-16,Analytics India Magazine,Top Weekly News: OpenAI Codex To Biggest Cryptocurrency Heist,https://analyticsindiamag.com/top-weekly-news-openai-codex-to-biggest-cryptocurrency-heist/,"Earlier this week, OpenAI announced the release of OpenAI Codex through an API in private beta. An AI system, Codex, translates natural language to code, meaning it can interpret and execute commands given in plain English. This makes it possible to build a natural language interface for existing apps. Codex is designed to assist and speed up programming work for both professionals and coding amateurs. OpenAI’s demo video, featuring founders Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman, demonstrated how Codex can build simple websites and rudimentary games.

Today OpenAI launched Codex, which is an API that uses AI to write code from natural language.



There's a demo video here: https://t.co/hOOfo3MZlu — Sam Altman (@sama) August 10, 2021

OpenAI’s AI pair programmer Copilot is based on Codex. Copilot takes context from the code being written and suggests whole lines and functions. OpenAI claims that the latest version of Codex is more advanced and can create and complete a chunk of code.

Codex is a descendant of OpenAI’s language model GPT-3 that can work with written words uniquely due to its sizable training data. The data contains both natural language and billions of lines of source code from publicly available sources, including code in public GitHub repositories.

It is still in its early stages, but the developers behind Codex warn that since its responses are based on training data from the internet, Codex can be prompted to generate racist, denigratory, and harmful outputs in code comments.

Biggest Cryptocurrency Heist

More than $600 million worth of crypto was stolen recently in what is touted as one of the biggest cryptocurrency heists. Blockchain site Poly Network said that the hackers exploited a vulnerability in its system and swindled off thousands of digital tokens like Ether. This hack is on par with recent breaches at exchanges such as Coincheck and Mt Gox in terms of scale.

The company posted on Twitter, urging the thieves to establish communication and return the hacked assets. Only hours after the hack, the attacker started returning the funds to the online wallets controlled by Poly, starting with small amounts and then in millions.

Decentralised finance aims to reproduce traditional financial products like loans and trading without the involvement of middlemen. It is one of the fastest-growing spaces within the crypto industry. Although it has attracted heavy investment, running into billions of dollars, the DeFi space is prone to hacks and scams. One recent example includes a token by billionaire investor Mark Cuban that dropped from $60 to several thousandths of a cent due to an alleged bank run.

Top Honour for NVIDIA’s Huang

Intel co-founder Rober Noyce is considered one of the pioneers of the semiconductor industry, often referred to as the ‘mayor of Silicon Valley’. In his honour, the Noyce Award is handed over to people with demonstrated excellence in the semiconductor field. This year, this prestigious award would be bestowed upon NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, the Semiconductor Industry Association announced. The ceremony will be held on November 18.

“Jensen’s accomplishments have fueled countless innovations — from gaming to scientific computing to self-driving cars — and he continues to advance technologies that will transform our industry and the world,” said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO.

Huang founded NVIDIA in 1993 and, since then, has been a recipient of several awards and recognitions, including the IEEE Founder’s Medal and Dr Morris Chang Exemplary Leadership Award. In 2019, Harvard Business Review named him the best performing CEO over the lifetime of their tenure; before that, in 2017, Huang was named Fortune’s Businessperson of the Year.

Last year, the Noyce award was presented to Dr Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.

Four Decades to IBM’s First PC

Forty years back, on August 12, IBM released its first personal computer, Model 5150 or just IBM PC. Notoriously known for being highly bureaucratic and unable to keep up with the fast-growing market for portable computers, IBM foray into the PC market was nothing short of a watershed moment. Created by the team of engineers and designers directed by Don Estridge, IBM PC soon became a massive influence in the industry. It was based on open architecture.

The specifications of the IBM PC became standard in computer design, and the only significant competition it faced was from the Apple Macintosh line. It would not be an exaggeration to say that modern personal computers are distant descendants of the IBM PC. IBM PC’s innovation, quality, and affordability were a big frenzy among the masses when it was first introduced.

Bezos-Murthy end Joint India Venture

In India, Amazon has come under fire for alleged dominance through business practices that small vendors and retailers deem unfair and illegal. As a result, an antitrust investigation is undergoing against Amazon and other giants, including Flipkart.

Amidst this antitrust probe, Amazon has decided to disband a controversial joint venture in India with Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. The seven-year-old joint venture called Prione Business Services Pvt Ltd. will cease operations from mid-2022. In a joint statement, the parties said they have mutually decided to discontinue their joint venture beyond the end of this current term. Discontinuation of this venture could mean a possible setback for Amazon as India’s online market is projected to surge to $1 trillion.

2021-08-16,Bitcoin News,UK Police Seize USB Stick With Ethereum Worth $9.5 Million – News Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-police-seize-usb-stick-ethereum-worth-9-5-million/,"UK Police Seize USB Stick With Ethereum Worth $9.5 Million

British detectives have seized $22.25 million from operators of an international cryptocurrency scam. Among the items seized was a USB stick containing ethereum worth $9.5 million. The police are now attempting to contact the victims of this scam to return their funds.

UK Police Seize Crypto in USB Stick

The U.K.’s Greater Manchester Police announced Wednesday that its Economic Crime Unit has seized a USB stick containing “huge amounts of ethereum, the second largest crypto currency after bitcoin.”

The USB stick was discovered after the police arrested a 23-year-old male and a 25-year-old female for fraud and money laundering offenses. The pair have since been released under investigation.

The announcement details:

Specialist officers received intelligence that those running the scheme had been in Manchester for a limited time and tracked them down, recovering an encrypted USB stick containing $9.5 million of stolen ethereum.

The police said that $12.7 million more were seized a few days later when a “cryptograph safety deposit box” and “the code to access it” were located. In total, $22.25 million were seized from the scammers, the Economic Crime Unit confirmed. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,231.

The victims of the scam were based in the U.K., U.S., Europe, China, Australia, and Hong Kong. They “deposited money, including life savings, into what they thought was an online savings and trading service using Binance Smart Chain, which stores and records transactions made in crypto-currency confirming their movement and value,” the police described.

After a significant amount of money had been deposited, the scammers shut down their website and transferred the funds to their own accounts.

The police detailed:

The sum totalled 90% of the cryptocurrency stolen, and work has now begun on re-uniting it with the rightful owners, some of whom are still unknown and located across the world.

Detective Chief Inspector Joe Harrop commented: “We urge anyone involved [in] these platforms to use extreme caution, and know that there are still significant vulnerabilities and risks that could put their savings at risk.”

UK police have recently been active in seizing cryptocurrencies. In July, the Metropolitan Police seized £180 million in crypto as part of a money-laundering investigation after they confiscated £114 million in crypto a few weeks prior.

2021-08-16,Moneycontrol,Here’s how you can safely invest in Cryptocurrency in India,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/special-site/heres-how-you-can-safely-invest-in-cryptocurrency-in-india-7367281.html,"Even though the country is yet to formulate regulations for investing in cryptocurrency, there was almost a 20,000% increase (from $200 million to $40 billion) in crypto investments in India in the past year alone! Several people rode the wave and reaped unparalleled returns on their investments.

So, how can you get started? And which is the safest way possible to invest in cryptocurrency in India? Let’s explore

Despite the Indian government's debatable stance on crypto assets, cryptocurrency investments in India are still increasing. Start-ups like WazirX are even introducing newer concepts like Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) . What are the reasons behind this uptick?

Low internet costs, rising real estate prices, and increased taxation on metals like Gold and Silver also seemed to have contributed to the paradigm shift of investing in tangible assets.

Moreover, the introduction of cryptocurrency brought an unprecedented degree of latitude for people as young as 18 years of age to invest and grow their portfolios.

The high inflation rates in India along with the restrictive and non-streamlined modes of investment presented a golden opportunity for visionary entrepreneurs to set up cryptocurrency exchanges in India.

Due to the intrinsic nature of crypto and blockchain technology, entrepreneurs like Nischal Shetty were able to give rise to crypto exchanges that have an intuitive and easy-to-use User Interface (UI). These crypto exchanges also offered almost no annual maintenance charges (AMCs) and a much lower trading fee.

With 24x7 availability, minimal design, and potentially sky-high returns on investment for any individual - crypto exchanges boomed.

The most favored cryptocurrency, judging from the market cap, is the OG token – Bitcoin (BTC). However, many argue that Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum network could soon replace Bitcoin.

Other popular crypto tokens are:

Polygon (MATIC)

Litecoin (LTC)

Binance Coin (BNB)

Polkadot (DOT)

Cardano (ADA)

Solana (SOL)

The bottom line

Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are disrupting the modern financial infrastructure and governance for the better.

However, due to the lack of regulatory bodies in the DeFi space, individual investors must do their part in researching about DeFi projects and 'tokenomics' (economics of a cryptocurrency/crypto token) before investing their money in a highly volatile market.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/08/wazir_article_4-770x433.png',)",none
