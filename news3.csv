2021-09-05,CTV News Vancouver,"Cryptocurrency scam victim suffered 'over $100,000' in losses, Delta police say",https://bc.ctvnews.ca/cryptocurrency-scam-victim-suffered-over-100-000-in-losses-delta-police-say-1.5574115,"VANCOUVER -- Police in Delta are warning residents thinking about investing in cryptocurrency to do their due diligence, after receiving six complaints about scams in recent weeks.

Most of the complaints were made in August, according to a news release from the Delta Police Department.

""Unfortunately their losses have been significant, ranging from just under $5,000 to over $100,000 in one file,"" police said in their release.

Police said there are ""a number of common factors"" in the six files that have been reported to them.

In most of the cases, the scammers contacted the victims through online platforms - such as dating sites and chat apps - and established a relationship with them.

""Investors were typically encouraged to e-transfer funds from their bank accounts to mobile wallets, and from there to unknown accounts,"" Delta police said. ""When victims tried to withdraw their 'profits' or investment, the money was either gone, or the victim was informed they needed to pay considerable additional fees to access their money.""

Police said would-be investors should research the name of the investment company or website they're considering to see if anyone else has been scammed. Investors should also avoid taking advice from people online who they've never met, police said.

For reputable information for investors, Delta police recommend visiting the websites of the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Canadian Securities Administrators.","('https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1717992.1394149852!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg',)",none
2021-09-05,Todayuknews,Vitalik Buterin Has Suggestions for Dogecoin and Doge’s Cooperation With Ethereum – Altcoins Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/vitalik-buterin-has-suggestions-for-dogecoin-and-doges-cooperation-with-ethereum-altcoins-bitcoin-news/,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has some suggestions of what he personally would like to see happening with Dogecoin and the meme cryptocurrency’s cooperation with Ethereum.

Vitalik Buterin on Dogecoin’s Development and Its Ethereum Collaboration

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his thoughts on the potential cooperation between Dogecoin and Ethereum Wednesday as part of a Twitter experiment he is conducting where only the 268 people he followed can ask him questions.

Three Arrows Capital CEO Zhu Su asked: “What are some promising ideas for Ethereum / Doge cooperation? What was it about Doge that got you interested in the project?” Su recently said that he is “very bullish” on dogecoin and that the meme cryptocurrency has “no risk of it having any regulatory issues ever.”

Referencing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW), Buterin replied to Su:

Personally, I hope that doge can switch to PoS soon, perhaps using Ethereum code. I also hope they don’t cancel the 5b/year annual PoW issuance, instead they put it in some kind of DAO that funds global public goods. Would fit well with dogecoin’s non-greedy wholesome ethos.

In June, Buterin also talked about potential cooperation between Ethereum and Dogecoin. “If Doge wants to somehow bridge to Ethereum, and then people can trade DOGE thousands of times a second inside of loopring, then that would be amazing,” the Ethereum co-founder opined. “I think if we can have a secure Doge-to-Ethereum bridge. That would be amazing, and then when Ethereum gets any scalability that works for Ethereum assets, you would be able to trade wrapped DOGE with very low transaction fees and very high speed as well,” he further said.

In August, the Dogecoin Foundation relaunched with Buterin as one of its board advisors, along with Jared Birchall, a close associate of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, another prominent dogecoin supporter.

Among numerous questions Buterin received as part of his Twitter experiment was whether he was likely to create another cryptocurrency. The Ethereum co-founder simply responded with “No.”

What do you think about Vitalik Buterin’s suggestions for Dogecoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

2021-09-05,Altcoin Buzz,Top Crypto News: 09/04,https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/top-crypto-news-09-04/,"Bitcoin reached a low of $49,706, and now it’s trading at $49,850. On the other hand, Ethereum is trading a little bit below $3,900.

Let’s examine some of the top crypto news stories for the day.

1 – Poolz Starts $2 Million Fund to Invest in Metaverse and NFT Gaming

Poolz is known as decentralized cross-chain platform that helps crypto projects in raising funds before listing. Their latest move is to establish a new fund to support metaverse and NFT gaming platforms. This goes together with the wishes of their community, who shows increased interest in this sphere.

The fund itself will invest in intriguing projects capable of transforming the industry. Two million dollars will be the much needed cash injection pushing new players on the horizon.

The co-founder of Poolz, Liam Cohen, is highly optimistic: “[Metaverses are] not just the future of games but also the future economy of the internet. The time is not far away when we get very close to the immersive metaverse like what we see in movies such as Ready Player One,” he noted.



2 – Zee Studios Launches Its First-Ever NFT on Polygon

Zee Studios will now have their own NFT store on Polygon. It’s going to be powered by NFTically – a platform that allows anyone to create their own NFT stores without prior technical knowledge.

Zee Studios is well known in India, particularly in the Indian entertainment industry. Entering the world of NFTs will be a new experience for them. Apart from creating an additional revenue stream, it will create a new type of connection with their fans across the world.

3 – Immutable Launches a Gas-Free Solution for Minting and Trading NFTs

In the past, scaling NFT projects was pretty hard. Developers had only a few alternatives if they didn’t like Ethereum – move to another blockchain or sidechain. None of the options were good because they had to sacrifice the scale and security provided by Ethereum. But staying on the world’s 2nd biggest blockchain was creating a bottleneck to mass adoption due to high gas fees.

Mass adoption can get a massive push forwards with Immutable X offering a Layer-2 solution. It offers 100% gas-free minting and trading of NFTs, massive scalability with 9,000 transactions per second, and the security of Ethereum. Other benefits include self custody and seamless UX for both developers and users.

4 – Cryption Network Upgrades to Core Farms 2.0

Cryption Network pushes crypto adoption further by developing products for normal retail investors. In its latest move, the network is stopping its Core Farms on PolyDEX and upgrading them to version 2.0. This provides both better APR and rewards for the community.

Core farms are important to provide liquidity for frequently traded cryptos such as ETH, BTC, MATIC, and stablecoins. Cryption previously used farms such as Matic-USDC, Matic-ETH, and others. The new farms will now have CNT pairs in them and will be listed on PolyDEX. Some pair examples are CNT-ETH, CNT-USDC, and CNT-MATIC. This will be a great boost for the CNT price over the long-term.

The old farms will end, and the new farms will launch on 6th of September 3pm UTC.

5 – World Origin Wilder Series Opens Its Second NFT for Bidding

In our last bit of crypto news stories for the day, Wilder World has launched its second 5D NFT poster. What they do differently is give you more value than just buying an NFT and then simply storing it in your wallet. Their innovation gives you NFTs that are Wilder World Metaverse ready – 5D hats you can wear, cars you can drive, and apartments you can own.

2021-09-05,The Star,Cryptocurrencies draw Mafia online in search for ill-gotten gains,https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2021/09/05/cryptocurrencies-draw-mafia-online-in-search-for-ill-gotten-gains,"ROME: Those involved in organised crime can't afford to fall behind the times, especially when it comes to raking in cash.



So cryptocurrency is not only an issue for people who are involved in technology and finance, but also for those trying to either sustain or break up criminal networks.



More and more, Italy's Mafia is turning to digital currency for its illegal operations, for example.



""All criminal organisations, even those like the Mafia, have an interest in using these instruments for their business,"" said an official with the DIA, Italy's anti-Mafia police, in an interview with dpa. He asked that his name not be used for safety reasons.



The best-known cryptocurrency is bitcoin, which is purely digital, meaning there's no bill or coin to be held. Instead, the money is made up of cryptological codes of numbers and letters. They are generally decentralised, with transactions taking place directly between users.



That means the transactions do not involve financial regulators or government guidelines. Users employ something called a blockchain, a complex kind of database, to make sure that bitcoins aren't duplicated.



That's the kind of thing that appeals to the Mafia, which is how it became involved in digital finance, said the DIA official from his office on the outskirts of Rome. Transactions with digital currencies are fast and offer security, as well as a kind of anonymity, all of which are advantageous for illegal business.



That makes it hard to find anyone involved in any business using cryptocurrency. Police tend not to reveal data about trade volumes, investigations or damages linked to any illegal business.



For example, the 'Ndrangheta Mafia, based in Calabria, use cryptocurrencies for trade with Latin American cartels, according to the most recent DIA report to lawmakers, focused on the first half of 2020. The 'Ndrangheta focuses primarily on the cocaine trade and has made use of digital money to ease transactions with Colombian cartels.



And there's more, according to the report.



""The Mafia seems to be directing its attention to cybercrime and the possibilities of the dark web, which are both hard to monitor, in order to direct large sums of financial resources to completely illegal ends.""



By turning money raised illegally into cryptocurrency and then using it in illegal parts of the Internet, like the dark web, the Mafia can launder money or pay bills without attracting notice.



Still, the police have enjoyed moments of success, despite the anonymity and wide reach of the web. At the end of April, Italian police brought in more than two dozen members of the Nigerian organised group Black Aze in connection to illegal migration and the drug trade. They stand accused of using bitcoin to buy fake credit cards online, which they used to buy yet more merchandise.



In another case, in August 2019, police put four Ukrainians into handcuffs in the Tuscan city of Lucca. They were accused of being part of an organisation using the dark web to buy drugs like cocaine, LSD and marijuana from Germany and the Netherlands using bitcoin.



According to the DIA report, police are bulking up the number of units capable of Internet investigations, with more collaboration with the country's finance police and national police forces.



One goal is to make sure investigators gather evidence in a legally sound fashion, making sure data is not subject to tampering, a member of the Carabinieri, the national police, told La Repubblica newspaper in June. That's the only way to make sure this evidence stands up in court.



German police have also gained experience with cryptocurrencies.



""The use of cryptocurrencies for online payments in the course of crimes, such as those related to customs, has climbed significantly,"" according to a statement from the country's main customs agency.



Investigators say bitcoin and another currency, monero, are the favourites.



Customs officials also say they've seen that cryptocurrencies are being used for crimes that involve finding ways to anonymise the purchase and shipping of illegal goods.



Doing so allows criminals to disguise their identity and location, since the payment goes from one user to another and not through any bank, which would normally alert authorities if anything strange popped up. – dpa

2021-09-05,Todayuknews,NFL Bars Teams From Participating in Certain Cryptocurrency and NFT Ventures: Report – Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/nfl-bars-teams-from-participating-in-certain-cryptocurrency-and-nft-ventures-report-bitcoin-news/,"According to a recent report, the National Football League (NFL) advised teams that they could not, at least for now, sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and sponsorships to digital currency companies. Advertisements for specific crypto assets were mentioned alongside initial coin offerings (ICOs), according to various club sources who remained anonymous.

Anonymous Club Sources Disclose the NFL’s New Policy

On Friday, The Athletic reported that sources familiar with the matter detail that the NFL is barring teams from participating in certain crypto ventures. The NFL’s alleged ban follows a great number of blockchain, NFT, and cryptocurrency endorsements from a number of star athletes and teams.

For instance, Tom Brady has shown his support for bitcoin with laser eyes, but he’s also started his own NFT company called Autograph. Brady and his Brazilian supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen also signed a long-term partnership with FTX.

But the seven-time Super Bowl champion is not the only one dipping into the crypto economy. The world’s largest cryptocurrency asset manager, Grayscale Investments, has partnered with the New York Giants. Trevor Lawrence, the NFL’s No. 1 Draft Pick, put his signing bonus into crypto in May. NFL player and offensive lineman Russell Okung gets half of his salary in bitcoin (BTC).

Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes released a collection of NFTs on Makersplace on March 17th. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers player, Rob “Gronk” Gronkowski, sold an NFT collection as well. Moreover, MLB and the National Basketball Association (NBA) have both gotten involved in the crypto asset and non-fungible token space.

“Multiple club sources” from the NFL told The Athletic contributor Daniel Kaplan teams cannot contribute to this space at the moment. An anonymous NFL team official read the following:

Clubs are prohibited from selling, or otherwise allowing within club controlled media, advertisements for specific cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings, other cryptocurrency sales or any other media category as it relates to blockchain, digital asset or as blockchain company, except as outlined in this policy.

NFL’s New Policy Does Allow Specific Crypto Partnerships

The report does not disclose if any negative repercussions have been felt by those who have already participated with crypto firms or if they have been granted immunity for now. If the report holds weight, the NFL’s action may just stop players and teams from following the lead of other clubs and players.

The NFL’s purported new policy does allow sponsorships with firms “whose primary business is providing investment advisory and or fund management services in connection with cryptocurrency, provided that such advertising sponsorship rights are limited to promoting the company’s corporate brands,” the anonymous source concluded.

2021-09-04,Todayuknews,JPMorgan Says Cryptocurrency Markets Are ‘Looking Frothy’ – Markets and Prices Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/jpmorgan-says-cryptocurrency-markets-are-looking-frothy-markets-and-prices-bitcoin-news/,"Global investment bank JPMorgan says cryptocurrency markets are “looking frothy” as retail investors spill over from the stock market into cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Crypto Markets Look Frothy, According to JPMorgan

JPMorgan published a note Wednesday on the stock market and cryptocurrencies. It explains that retail investors bought stocks at a record pace over the summer with an estimated net flow into the U.S. stock market of $13 billion in August after reaching a record high of almost $16 billion in July.

The JPMorgan analysts asserted that the stock-buying frenzy spilled over into altcoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in August, and the surge in NFTs and decentralized finance (defi) activity has boosted the price of certain cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, solana, and cardano.

They wrote:

Cryptocurrency markets [are] looking frothy again.

As Bitcoin.com News reported, the crypto market gained approximately 83% in value over the last three months, led by altcoins. The global crypto market cap is currently $2.28 trillion. Bitcoin’s dominance slipped from 47% on Aug. 1 to 41.39% Saturday. Ethereum (ETH) currently represents 20.13% of the entire crypto market, followed by cardano (ADA) at 4.11%. Solana (SOL) represents 1.80%.

Solana has become one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies this year. At the price of $141.04 per coin, SOL is now the seventh-largest crypto by market capitalization. The coin gained 310.8% during the last month and 3,277.6% year-to-date.

The JPMorgan analysts noted that altcoin trading now represents about 33% of the crypto market, emphasizing that it was a big increase from the 22% reading in early August. They concluded:

The share of altcoins looks rather elevated by historical standards and in our opinion it is more likely to be a reflection of froth and retail investor ‘mania’ rather than a reflection of a structural uptrend.

2021-09-04,The Market Periodical,ICP Coin Has Entered Into A Short Consolidation Phase,https://themarketperiodical.com/2021/09/04/icp-coin-has-entered-into-a-short-consolidation-phase/,"The ICP coin currently trades at $73.39, with an intraday gain of 11.5%

The RSI shows a slight divergence concerning the coin’s price action

The ICP/BTC pair was trading at 0.01457BTC with a gain of 10.11%

The ICP coin is currently resonating in a consolidation phase. This range began when the price was rejected from the $76 mark with an inside day candle. However, such minor consolidations can be an excellent way for the price to stabilize and maintain a healthy bull run. Therefore, the ICP traders can wait until the bulls are back in business and continue their rally.

The RSI (BULLISH) value is 60, indicating a bullish sentiment in the coin market. However, the investors can notice a substantial bearish divergence in the RSI line.

ICP Coin Price Resonating In a Rectangle Pattern

The ICP coin chart displays the formation of a rectangular pattern in the 4hr time frame chart. This range has its crucial SR level at the $55-$76 mark. The price is currently approaching the overhead resistance. However, an explicit confirmation that a trade is only possible when the price provides a decisive breakout from either of its levels.

ADVERTISEMENT

Due to the sideways movement in the ICP coin, the crucial EMA’s of this chart are drawn too close together, making it challenging to trade any signal properly. Thus, The ICP traders can limit EMA’s to 50 and 200 EMA in order to avoid confusion which will allow them to identify the primary trend in this coin.

The MACD indicator (BULLISH) indicates a bullish momentum in the coin as both the MACD line and the signal line are still moving above the neutral zone(0.00).

Conclusion: From the technical perspective, the ICP coin’s outlook is positive regarding price action and indicators. Thus, trend traders looking for long opportunities can consider. Moreover, the price is currently wavering in a small range, and if it can give a decisive at any of its levels, then the ICP trader can grab an excellent directional move in this coin.

Support: $55

Resistance: $76","('https://themarketperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s13-15.jpg',)",none

2021-09-05,CTV News Vancouver,"Cryptocurrency scam victim suffered 'over $100,000' in losses, Delta police say",https://bc.ctvnews.ca/cryptocurrency-scam-victim-suffered-over-100-000-in-losses-delta-police-say-1.5574115,"VANCOUVER -- Police in Delta are warning residents thinking about investing in cryptocurrency to do their due diligence, after receiving six complaints about scams in recent weeks.

Most of the complaints were made in August, according to a news release from the Delta Police Department.

""Unfortunately their losses have been significant, ranging from just under $5,000 to over $100,000 in one file,"" police said in their release.

Police said there are ""a number of common factors"" in the six files that have been reported to them.

In most of the cases, the scammers contacted the victims through online platforms - such as dating sites and chat apps - and established a relationship with them.

""Investors were typically encouraged to e-transfer funds from their bank accounts to mobile wallets, and from there to unknown accounts,"" Delta police said. ""When victims tried to withdraw their 'profits' or investment, the money was either gone, or the victim was informed they needed to pay considerable additional fees to access their money.""

Police said would-be investors should research the name of the investment company or website they're considering to see if anyone else has been scammed. Investors should also avoid taking advice from people online who they've never met, police said.

For reputable information for investors, Delta police recommend visiting the websites of the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Canadian Securities Administrators.","('https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1717992.1394149852!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg',)",none
2021-09-05,Todayuknews,Vitalik Buterin Has Suggestions for Dogecoin and Doge’s Cooperation With Ethereum – Altcoins Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/vitalik-buterin-has-suggestions-for-dogecoin-and-doges-cooperation-with-ethereum-altcoins-bitcoin-news/,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has some suggestions of what he personally would like to see happening with Dogecoin and the meme cryptocurrency’s cooperation with Ethereum.

Vitalik Buterin on Dogecoin’s Development and Its Ethereum Collaboration

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his thoughts on the potential cooperation between Dogecoin and Ethereum Wednesday as part of a Twitter experiment he is conducting where only the 268 people he followed can ask him questions.

Three Arrows Capital CEO Zhu Su asked: “What are some promising ideas for Ethereum / Doge cooperation? What was it about Doge that got you interested in the project?” Su recently said that he is “very bullish” on dogecoin and that the meme cryptocurrency has “no risk of it having any regulatory issues ever.”

Referencing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW), Buterin replied to Su:

Personally, I hope that doge can switch to PoS soon, perhaps using Ethereum code. I also hope they don’t cancel the 5b/year annual PoW issuance, instead they put it in some kind of DAO that funds global public goods. Would fit well with dogecoin’s non-greedy wholesome ethos.

In June, Buterin also talked about potential cooperation between Ethereum and Dogecoin. “If Doge wants to somehow bridge to Ethereum, and then people can trade DOGE thousands of times a second inside of loopring, then that would be amazing,” the Ethereum co-founder opined. “I think if we can have a secure Doge-to-Ethereum bridge. That would be amazing, and then when Ethereum gets any scalability that works for Ethereum assets, you would be able to trade wrapped DOGE with very low transaction fees and very high speed as well,” he further said.

In August, the Dogecoin Foundation relaunched with Buterin as one of its board advisors, along with Jared Birchall, a close associate of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, another prominent dogecoin supporter.

Among numerous questions Buterin received as part of his Twitter experiment was whether he was likely to create another cryptocurrency. The Ethereum co-founder simply responded with “No.”

What do you think about Vitalik Buterin’s suggestions for Dogecoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

2021-09-05,Altcoin Buzz,Top Crypto News: 09/04,https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/top-crypto-news-09-04/,"Bitcoin reached a low of $49,706, and now it’s trading at $49,850. On the other hand, Ethereum is trading a little bit below $3,900.

Let’s examine some of the top crypto news stories for the day.

1 – Poolz Starts $2 Million Fund to Invest in Metaverse and NFT Gaming

Poolz is known as decentralized cross-chain platform that helps crypto projects in raising funds before listing. Their latest move is to establish a new fund to support metaverse and NFT gaming platforms. This goes together with the wishes of their community, who shows increased interest in this sphere.

The fund itself will invest in intriguing projects capable of transforming the industry. Two million dollars will be the much needed cash injection pushing new players on the horizon.

The co-founder of Poolz, Liam Cohen, is highly optimistic: “[Metaverses are] not just the future of games but also the future economy of the internet. The time is not far away when we get very close to the immersive metaverse like what we see in movies such as Ready Player One,” he noted.



2 – Zee Studios Launches Its First-Ever NFT on Polygon

Zee Studios will now have their own NFT store on Polygon. It’s going to be powered by NFTically – a platform that allows anyone to create their own NFT stores without prior technical knowledge.

Zee Studios is well known in India, particularly in the Indian entertainment industry. Entering the world of NFTs will be a new experience for them. Apart from creating an additional revenue stream, it will create a new type of connection with their fans across the world.

3 – Immutable Launches a Gas-Free Solution for Minting and Trading NFTs

In the past, scaling NFT projects was pretty hard. Developers had only a few alternatives if they didn’t like Ethereum – move to another blockchain or sidechain. None of the options were good because they had to sacrifice the scale and security provided by Ethereum. But staying on the world’s 2nd biggest blockchain was creating a bottleneck to mass adoption due to high gas fees.

Mass adoption can get a massive push forwards with Immutable X offering a Layer-2 solution. It offers 100% gas-free minting and trading of NFTs, massive scalability with 9,000 transactions per second, and the security of Ethereum. Other benefits include self custody and seamless UX for both developers and users.

4 – Cryption Network Upgrades to Core Farms 2.0

Cryption Network pushes crypto adoption further by developing products for normal retail investors. In its latest move, the network is stopping its Core Farms on PolyDEX and upgrading them to version 2.0. This provides both better APR and rewards for the community.

Core farms are important to provide liquidity for frequently traded cryptos such as ETH, BTC, MATIC, and stablecoins. Cryption previously used farms such as Matic-USDC, Matic-ETH, and others. The new farms will now have CNT pairs in them and will be listed on PolyDEX. Some pair examples are CNT-ETH, CNT-USDC, and CNT-MATIC. This will be a great boost for the CNT price over the long-term.

The old farms will end, and the new farms will launch on 6th of September 3pm UTC.

5 – World Origin Wilder Series Opens Its Second NFT for Bidding

In our last bit of crypto news stories for the day, Wilder World has launched its second 5D NFT poster. What they do differently is give you more value than just buying an NFT and then simply storing it in your wallet. Their innovation gives you NFTs that are Wilder World Metaverse ready – 5D hats you can wear, cars you can drive, and apartments you can own.

2021-09-05,The Star,Cryptocurrencies draw Mafia online in search for ill-gotten gains,https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2021/09/05/cryptocurrencies-draw-mafia-online-in-search-for-ill-gotten-gains,"ROME: Those involved in organised crime can't afford to fall behind the times, especially when it comes to raking in cash.



So cryptocurrency is not only an issue for people who are involved in technology and finance, but also for those trying to either sustain or break up criminal networks.



More and more, Italy's Mafia is turning to digital currency for its illegal operations, for example.



""All criminal organisations, even those like the Mafia, have an interest in using these instruments for their business,"" said an official with the DIA, Italy's anti-Mafia police, in an interview with dpa. He asked that his name not be used for safety reasons.



The best-known cryptocurrency is bitcoin, which is purely digital, meaning there's no bill or coin to be held. Instead, the money is made up of cryptological codes of numbers and letters. They are generally decentralised, with transactions taking place directly between users.



That means the transactions do not involve financial regulators or government guidelines. Users employ something called a blockchain, a complex kind of database, to make sure that bitcoins aren't duplicated.



That's the kind of thing that appeals to the Mafia, which is how it became involved in digital finance, said the DIA official from his office on the outskirts of Rome. Transactions with digital currencies are fast and offer security, as well as a kind of anonymity, all of which are advantageous for illegal business.



That makes it hard to find anyone involved in any business using cryptocurrency. Police tend not to reveal data about trade volumes, investigations or damages linked to any illegal business.



For example, the 'Ndrangheta Mafia, based in Calabria, use cryptocurrencies for trade with Latin American cartels, according to the most recent DIA report to lawmakers, focused on the first half of 2020. The 'Ndrangheta focuses primarily on the cocaine trade and has made use of digital money to ease transactions with Colombian cartels.



And there's more, according to the report.



""The Mafia seems to be directing its attention to cybercrime and the possibilities of the dark web, which are both hard to monitor, in order to direct large sums of financial resources to completely illegal ends.""



By turning money raised illegally into cryptocurrency and then using it in illegal parts of the Internet, like the dark web, the Mafia can launder money or pay bills without attracting notice.



Still, the police have enjoyed moments of success, despite the anonymity and wide reach of the web. At the end of April, Italian police brought in more than two dozen members of the Nigerian organised group Black Aze in connection to illegal migration and the drug trade. They stand accused of using bitcoin to buy fake credit cards online, which they used to buy yet more merchandise.



In another case, in August 2019, police put four Ukrainians into handcuffs in the Tuscan city of Lucca. They were accused of being part of an organisation using the dark web to buy drugs like cocaine, LSD and marijuana from Germany and the Netherlands using bitcoin.



According to the DIA report, police are bulking up the number of units capable of Internet investigations, with more collaboration with the country's finance police and national police forces.



One goal is to make sure investigators gather evidence in a legally sound fashion, making sure data is not subject to tampering, a member of the Carabinieri, the national police, told La Repubblica newspaper in June. That's the only way to make sure this evidence stands up in court.



German police have also gained experience with cryptocurrencies.



""The use of cryptocurrencies for online payments in the course of crimes, such as those related to customs, has climbed significantly,"" according to a statement from the country's main customs agency.



Investigators say bitcoin and another currency, monero, are the favourites.



Customs officials also say they've seen that cryptocurrencies are being used for crimes that involve finding ways to anonymise the purchase and shipping of illegal goods.



Doing so allows criminals to disguise their identity and location, since the payment goes from one user to another and not through any bank, which would normally alert authorities if anything strange popped up. – dpa

2021-09-05,Todayuknews,NFL Bars Teams From Participating in Certain Cryptocurrency and NFT Ventures: Report – Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/nfl-bars-teams-from-participating-in-certain-cryptocurrency-and-nft-ventures-report-bitcoin-news/,"According to a recent report, the National Football League (NFL) advised teams that they could not, at least for now, sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and sponsorships to digital currency companies. Advertisements for specific crypto assets were mentioned alongside initial coin offerings (ICOs), according to various club sources who remained anonymous.

Anonymous Club Sources Disclose the NFL’s New Policy

On Friday, The Athletic reported that sources familiar with the matter detail that the NFL is barring teams from participating in certain crypto ventures. The NFL’s alleged ban follows a great number of blockchain, NFT, and cryptocurrency endorsements from a number of star athletes and teams.

For instance, Tom Brady has shown his support for bitcoin with laser eyes, but he’s also started his own NFT company called Autograph. Brady and his Brazilian supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen also signed a long-term partnership with FTX.

But the seven-time Super Bowl champion is not the only one dipping into the crypto economy. The world’s largest cryptocurrency asset manager, Grayscale Investments, has partnered with the New York Giants. Trevor Lawrence, the NFL’s No. 1 Draft Pick, put his signing bonus into crypto in May. NFL player and offensive lineman Russell Okung gets half of his salary in bitcoin (BTC).

Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes released a collection of NFTs on Makersplace on March 17th. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers player, Rob “Gronk” Gronkowski, sold an NFT collection as well. Moreover, MLB and the National Basketball Association (NBA) have both gotten involved in the crypto asset and non-fungible token space.

“Multiple club sources” from the NFL told The Athletic contributor Daniel Kaplan teams cannot contribute to this space at the moment. An anonymous NFL team official read the following:

Clubs are prohibited from selling, or otherwise allowing within club controlled media, advertisements for specific cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings, other cryptocurrency sales or any other media category as it relates to blockchain, digital asset or as blockchain company, except as outlined in this policy.

NFL’s New Policy Does Allow Specific Crypto Partnerships

The report does not disclose if any negative repercussions have been felt by those who have already participated with crypto firms or if they have been granted immunity for now. If the report holds weight, the NFL’s action may just stop players and teams from following the lead of other clubs and players.

The NFL’s purported new policy does allow sponsorships with firms “whose primary business is providing investment advisory and or fund management services in connection with cryptocurrency, provided that such advertising sponsorship rights are limited to promoting the company’s corporate brands,” the anonymous source concluded.

2021-09-04,Todayuknews,JPMorgan Says Cryptocurrency Markets Are ‘Looking Frothy’ – Markets and Prices Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/jpmorgan-says-cryptocurrency-markets-are-looking-frothy-markets-and-prices-bitcoin-news/,"Global investment bank JPMorgan says cryptocurrency markets are “looking frothy” as retail investors spill over from the stock market into cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Crypto Markets Look Frothy, According to JPMorgan

JPMorgan published a note Wednesday on the stock market and cryptocurrencies. It explains that retail investors bought stocks at a record pace over the summer with an estimated net flow into the U.S. stock market of $13 billion in August after reaching a record high of almost $16 billion in July.

The JPMorgan analysts asserted that the stock-buying frenzy spilled over into altcoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in August, and the surge in NFTs and decentralized finance (defi) activity has boosted the price of certain cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, solana, and cardano.

They wrote:

Cryptocurrency markets [are] looking frothy again.

As Bitcoin.com News reported, the crypto market gained approximately 83% in value over the last three months, led by altcoins. The global crypto market cap is currently $2.28 trillion. Bitcoin’s dominance slipped from 47% on Aug. 1 to 41.39% Saturday. Ethereum (ETH) currently represents 20.13% of the entire crypto market, followed by cardano (ADA) at 4.11%. Solana (SOL) represents 1.80%.

Solana has become one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies this year. At the price of $141.04 per coin, SOL is now the seventh-largest crypto by market capitalization. The coin gained 310.8% during the last month and 3,277.6% year-to-date.

The JPMorgan analysts noted that altcoin trading now represents about 33% of the crypto market, emphasizing that it was a big increase from the 22% reading in early August. They concluded:

The share of altcoins looks rather elevated by historical standards and in our opinion it is more likely to be a reflection of froth and retail investor ‘mania’ rather than a reflection of a structural uptrend.

2021-09-04,The Market Periodical,ICP Coin Has Entered Into A Short Consolidation Phase,https://themarketperiodical.com/2021/09/04/icp-coin-has-entered-into-a-short-consolidation-phase/,"The ICP coin currently trades at $73.39, with an intraday gain of 11.5%

The RSI shows a slight divergence concerning the coin’s price action

The ICP/BTC pair was trading at 0.01457BTC with a gain of 10.11%

The ICP coin is currently resonating in a consolidation phase. This range began when the price was rejected from the $76 mark with an inside day candle. However, such minor consolidations can be an excellent way for the price to stabilize and maintain a healthy bull run. Therefore, the ICP traders can wait until the bulls are back in business and continue their rally.

The RSI (BULLISH) value is 60, indicating a bullish sentiment in the coin market. However, the investors can notice a substantial bearish divergence in the RSI line.

ICP Coin Price Resonating In a Rectangle Pattern

The ICP coin chart displays the formation of a rectangular pattern in the 4hr time frame chart. This range has its crucial SR level at the $55-$76 mark. The price is currently approaching the overhead resistance. However, an explicit confirmation that a trade is only possible when the price provides a decisive breakout from either of its levels.

ADVERTISEMENT

Due to the sideways movement in the ICP coin, the crucial EMA’s of this chart are drawn too close together, making it challenging to trade any signal properly. Thus, The ICP traders can limit EMA’s to 50 and 200 EMA in order to avoid confusion which will allow them to identify the primary trend in this coin.

The MACD indicator (BULLISH) indicates a bullish momentum in the coin as both the MACD line and the signal line are still moving above the neutral zone(0.00).

Conclusion: From the technical perspective, the ICP coin’s outlook is positive regarding price action and indicators. Thus, trend traders looking for long opportunities can consider. Moreover, the price is currently wavering in a small range, and if it can give a decisive at any of its levels, then the ICP trader can grab an excellent directional move in this coin.

It’s that time of the year again where we remember and reminisce our teachers who unlocked a completely new world for us every time we saw them-the words of Shakespeare, the law of demand and supply, preparing cash flow statements, deriving square, cube roots, or simply, and most importantly, supporting and teaching us how to overcome rejections, failures and uncertainties, learnings that probably stay with us for a lifetime!

And another great teacher that most of us encountered and lived with as we grew up was perhaps the many gems of the Indian film industry. Bollywood has, over the years, given us many, many iconic stories and teachers who have made us crush hard, cry harder, but most surely, learn and imbibe the hardest. Let's face it, every time we venture into uncharted, unknown waters, or even in the face of extreme adversity, we always wish for someone to guide, counsel, and direct us.

But who do you turn to when it comes to seeking advice about jumping aboard on your journey into something as nascent, evolving, and new as the crypto-verse? There’s so much to detangle, learn and decipher here that a good teacher can certainly come in handy! And what better than to revisit the advice of some of the legendary Bollywood teachers and students to give you the perfect, right push you need? Read on:





Remember when

Munnabhai

endearingly tells

Circuit

about the number of bones the human body has? “206

type ka sirf haddi hai, todne ke time apun log sochte they kya?”

There are currently 11,602 cryptocurrencies in circulation! How do you decide which one to invest in?





According to Sharan Nair, CBO, Coin Switch Kuber, “The nascent cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving with different, newer coins, concepts and players regularly coming to the fore. The adoption of cryptocurrency in India is on the rise, making literacy about the same crucial since it is a new asset class that has many misconceptions floating around. Thus, in order to get the best returns and investment security, investors should proactively educate themselves on the different types of coins available.”





The answer, therefore, is simple! For a

Mazza ni crypto-investing/trading life,

research is paramount. The whitepaper of the concerned currency is a good place to start off your research, because it provides a deep dive into its practical use cases, scalability potential, roadmap, community engagement, growth prospects, and underlying applications, among others.









Turns out, when

Ram Shankar Nikumbh

from Taare Zameen Par said that,

“

Har bachche ki apni khoobi hoti hai, apni kabiliyat hoti hai, apni chahat hoti hai”

, he didn't just refer to Ishaan. Every cryptocurrency comes with a different value offering.

For instance, Bitcoin is widely considered to be a great store of value and an upcoming inflationary hedge, while Ethereum aims to usher in Web 3.0, while Cardano aims to negate the real-world massive environmental and energy issues that plague crypto-mining. Hence, it is important that you take a closer look into the underlying technology, fundamentals, and future potential of the coin you wish to invest in, along with assessing their vision, purpose, and the management quality backing it.

Ramalingam Subramanian, the head of Brand & Communication at CoinDCX, which launched DCX Learn in 2020 and aims to onboard 50 million investors in the times to come, sees huge, untapped potential in the crypto-education market. “We had identified the need to create awareness about cryptocurrency and blockchain among the public. We strongly believe that having a better understanding of crypto can help make informed decisions and also reap the benefits of investing in digital assets. Having this thought process in mind, we developed the platform to guide people through numerous informative digital content such as articles, online courses, interactive lectures, and much more,” he elaborates.

Finding the right ‘Gunda’

We swooned with SRK in Chak De India! as he broodingly, yet clearly announced how

“Har team mein bas ek hi gunda ho sakta hai, Aur is team ka gunda mein hun!









Turns out, your cryptocurrency portfolio also needs a few reliable, stable

gundas

-namely market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which command over 60 percent of the whole cryptoverse between them.









Sure, exponential yet short-term rises on a 7-day basis in relatively lesser-known currencies like XRP (10 percent), Solana (52 percent), Litecoin (25 percent), and Polkadot (28 percent) can be extremely tempting, but it's also a dangerous move in this highly

frenzied, speculative and volatile market. So, make sure you do not risk it all in unregulated, vague currencies the lure of making quick gains. Stick predominantly to the mains and the big-shots!

asically, as a first-time investor, there are only two investments you can make right now, which are Bitcoin and Etherium. Everything else is very difficult for a first-time investor to decide whether the fundamentals are strong or not. While there are many transformative, positive developments in this space as well, understanding them might not be as easy for everyone. If you are a long-term investor and believe in cryptocurrency as a digital asset, investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum are the simplest ways to start,” he explains.

!”









If Jeetu Bhaiya from Kota Factory was your mentor in navigating the world of cryptocurrency, he would say the same thing-the idea of earning 1000 percent profits traps you in, but there’s no guarantee of this, at all. The market is very erratic, uncertain, you can win big one day, or you can lose it all.









As Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex puts it, “The use cases of blockchain make it a compelling catalyst for the upliftment of mainstream finance. Different estimates suggest that more than 15 million Indians invest in these speculative markets. However, the bulk of these investors have little to no knowledge of the basics of cryptocurrencies and invest simply hoping to multiply returns overnight. This approach is quite short-sighted.”









Crypto markets are not always kind to those looking to make immediate profits. Therefore, invest wisely, and invest only your surplus amount, or the amount you can afford to lose, without significantly denting or eroding your other financial investments.

2021-09-04,Todayuknews,India Has New Plan to Regulate Cryptocurrencies: Report – Regulation Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/india-has-new-plan-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies-report-regulation-bitcoin-news/,"India is reportedly working on a new way to regulate cryptocurrencies. “The government is planning to define cryptocurrencies in the new draft bill that also proposes to compartmentalise virtual currencies on the basis of their use cases,” according to a report.

How India Will Regulate Cryptocurrencies

India is reportedly planning to regulate cryptocurrencies as commodities based on use cases. “The government is planning to define cryptocurrencies in the new draft bill that also proposes to compartmentalise virtual currencies on the basis of their use cases,” The Economic Times reported Friday, citing three people aware of the development. The publication detailed:

“Crypto assets can be either categorized on the basis of the technology they use or they can be defined on their end-use. So, before talking about how the regulations should work, the government has to spell out what it means by cryptocurrencies,” said one of the persons with knowledge of the matter. The person added that the government “is not looking to allow payments and settlements through virtual currencies.”

In addition, the government will decide which cryptocurrencies will be allowed to trade in India.

This would be the first time cryptocurrencies will be categorized by the technology they use, sources told the news outlet, clarifying that the government will focus on the end-use of the asset for regulatory purposes.

The news of the Indian government possibly considering regulating cryptocurrencies as commodities and based on their use cases is well received by the local crypto community.

Nischal Shetty, CEO of crypto exchange Wazirx, said: “This step is very positive for the crypto industry and I’m glad that the government is taking this direction towards crypto regulation. This will bring more clarity for the entire industry and push more entrepreneurs into this sector. It will reduce the fear of VC investors wanting to invest in the crypto industry in India. For retail investors and traders, this will again boost confidence and bring in a sense of stability.”

Vikram Subburaj, CEO of crypto exchange Giottus, opined: “Just like the internet, cryptocurrencies have a multitude of use cases and hence a nuanced approach is best rather than a one-size-fits-all policy. Even among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, there is a wide difference in objective and investor appeal.”

Mudrex CEO Edul Patel commented: “The idea of compartmentalizing cryptos on their use cases is thoughtful, and if implemented efficiently, would be a significant boost to the newly recognized asset class. It also shows that the government acknowledges that cryptocurrencies are much more than speculative instruments and have actual use cases.”

Do you think the Indian government will regulate cryptocurrencies in the way described above? Let us know in the comments section below.

2021-09-04,CNET,What is an NFT? Everything to know about the expensive digital tokens taking over cryptocurrency,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/what-is-an-nft-everything-to-know-about-the-expensive-digital-tokens-taking-over-cryptocurrency/,"Getty Images

Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, are a new kind of collectible that could -- or could not -- earn you big bucks. NFTs began in 2017 and became the new craze faster than any other cryptocurrency you may have heard of. But you can't keep NFTs in your dresser drawer, like Pokemon cards, a comic book or paintings. They're entirely digital and are tied to almost anything -- a video highlight, a meme or even a tweet.

If this doesn't make much sense to you, well you're not alone.

In short, NFTs offer a blockchain-created certificate of authenticity for a digital asset or piece of art. The interest has created a digital market that boasted $250 million in sales in 2020, with NFTs reaching new levels of hype from Visa, Warner Music Group and Nike. The craze has also driven scores of people to put up their own digital art and tweets for sale as NFTs. Even toilet paper companies are in on the latest cryptocurrency wave. Still confused? Here are the answers to your big questions about NFTs.

Now playing: Watch this: All you need to know about NFT

What's an NFT?

This is the part that takes a bit of open-mindedness. An NFT is a unique digital token, with most using the Ethereum blockchain to digitally record transactions. It's not a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum, because those are fungible -- exchangeable for another Bitcoin or cash. NFTs are recorded in a digital ledger in the same way as cryptocurrency, so there's a listing of who owns each one.

What makes an NFT unique is the digital asset tied to the token. This can be an image, video, tweet or piece of music that's uploaded to a marketplace, which creates the NFT to be sold. The technology started in 2015 when unique tokens were created for the Ethereum blockchain, but they became a big deal in February.

Does owning an NFT mean that I own the asset?

Nope.

That's the real kicker to understanding the whole concept. The person who buys the NFT doesn't own the actual asset.

""NFTs challenge the idea of ownership: digital files can be reproduced infinitely and you do not (usually) buy the copyright or a license when purchasing an NFT,"" said Jeffrey Thompson, associate professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey.

For example, the creator of the Nyan Cat meme sold an NFT of it for $590,000. The person who bought the token owns the token but doesn't actually own the meme. That still belongs to the creator, who held onto intellectual and creative rights.

What the owner of the token has is a record and a hash code showing ownership of the unique token associated with the particular digital asset. People might download Nyan Cat and use it on social media if they want, but they won't own the token. This also means they can't sell the token as the owner can.

Why are NFTs so expensive?

As with physical collectibles such as Beanie Babies, baseball cards and toys, there's a market for NFTs. The buyers tend to be tech-savvy individuals who understand the idea of wanting to purchase digital goods and likely made a killing this past year with cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, for example, went from just over $100 last March to a current price of about $3,400. In some cases, buyers are just flexing their digital wallets to show off how much crypto they have, but for others, there's a deeper interest.

""Specifically for art-related NFTs, there is a huge surge in demand due to their novelty and creativity of early artists,"" Jason Lau, chief operating officer of crypto exchange OKCoin, said in an email. ""Whether it's a physical work with an attached NFT (think of it as a digital autograph and proof of veracity), or an entirely digital work (where the NFT is the art), this new medium is opening new ways for collectors and artists to explore their relationship with the artwork itself.""

It's also great for the artists, says Lau. By selling digital art directly to those interested, an artist can begin monetizing work without having to try to sell it in a gallery.

What kind of NFTs are out there?

NFTs can be tied to any digital asset. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sold the first tweet, as an NFT, for $2.9 million. Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski created his own limited-edition trading cards that sold as NFTs for a total of $1.8 million. Kings of Leon sold NFTs of their newest album and made over $2 million. New York Times reporter Kevin Roose sold an image of his column about NFTs for $560,000. There's even one guy who sold NFTs for his farts.

Recently, Fortune gave its readers a chance to get in on the NFT craze. The company sold 256 copies of the limited edition cover from the graphic artist Pplpleasr for Fortune's August/September magazine on OpenSea. The copies sold out within five minutes starting at $1 Etherum (estimated $3,000). But the NFTs were available for resale at three times the cost.

And in August, a clip art of a rock, better known as Ether Rock, was sold for $400,000 Etherum (estimated $1.3 million). Two weeks ago, it was valued at $97,716. And in August, Visa announced its NFT CryptoPunks purchase for $150,000 in Ethereum. The financial corporation believes that NFTs play a big role in the ""future of retail, social media, entertainment, and commerce."" And Vine's co-creator, Dom Hoffman, is reportedly inventing a new way to gamify NFTs with his fantasy gaming console, Supdive.

This @KingJames NBA Top Shot was sold today for $179k.. https://t.co/7MxD3g9n1h — Darren Heitner (@DarrenHeitner) March 16, 2021

As the hype for NFTs grows, expect more digital assets to come up for sale and bring in some big money.

Where can I buy or sell an NFT?

While you may not want to jump right in bidding six figures, there are multiple NFT marketplaces out there to check out, with Opensea being the biggest. Buyers can search for art, domain names and random collectibles to bid on without having to break the bank.

On the other hand, if you want to sell an NFT of your art, you can use NFTify, the Shopify NFT store, to sell NFTs without creating your own store. You'll also need a MetaMask account to get going. And Burberry recently announced a partnership with Mythical Games to gamify buying, selling and collecting toys as NFTs through the Blankos Block Party game. CNET's own Chris Parker also made a step-by-step guide on how to make and sell your own NFT, in the video below.

What are the downsides of NFTs?

A drawback is the hundreds of dollars in fees required to create an NFT. If you're making your own token on the Ethereum blockchain, you need to use some Ethereum, which as mentioned earlier is kind of pricey. Then after you make an NFT, there's a ""gas"" fee that pays for the work that goes into handling the transaction and that's also based on the price of Ethereum. Marketplaces simplify the process by handling everything for a fee when an NFT is sold.

There's also an environmental cost. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum requires computers to handle the computations, known as ""mining,"" and those computer tasks require a lot of energy. An analysis from Cambridge University found that mining for Bitcoin consumed more energy than the entire country of Argentina. Ethereum is second to Bitcoin in popularity, and its power consumption is on the rise and comparable to the amount of energy used by Libya.","('https://www.cnet.com/a/img/FipiXkLmteC2WrEvx8MqCMtD_g8=/1200x630/2021/04/06/ffd7569a-cf4f-4dbc-9612-ba6f51ba8f88/gettyimages-1231935363.jpg',)",none

As the cryptocurrency market cap hovers above the $2 trillion mark, bitcoin - the world's largest and most popular cryptocurrency may touch the $100,000-mark by the end of this year with its current bull run, according to experts. (Also Read: Crypto Market Reclaims Market Cap Of $2 Trillion, Fuelled By Gains In Bitcoin )

''Crypto assets are moving towards becoming mainstream with many brands around the world accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment. The current bull run is expected to continue and we are highly optimistic that bitcoin will hit the $100,000 mark by the end of this year,'' said Mr Shivam Thakral, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), BuyUcoin.

The total market value of cryptocurrencies rose above the $2 trillion mark last month as bitcoin continued to climb along with other coins such as cardano, XRP, and dogecoin. Presently, the global crypto market cap is $2.29 trillion, registering an increase of 0.04 per cent increase over yesterday, according to data by CoinMarketCap.



''The surge in the crypto market cap indicates wider acceptance of crypto assets across the globe. The world's oldest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has witnessed a fantastic rally recently and the latest ethereum upgrade, also known as London Hard Fork, has boosted the ether price,'' added Mr Thakral, CEO of India's second-longest-running cryptocurrency exchange.

Bitcoin's price surged past the $50,000 mark last month for the first time since May, continuing its rebound from a long slump, as investors bet that the prospect of more US stimulus spending would lead to further gains for the virtual asset. Bitcoin has risen by around 81 per cent since hitting a yearly low of $27,700 in January 2021.

The recovery in cryptocurrency comes as a few more established financial services companies offer their customers access to virtual coins. PayPal Holdings Inc announced last month that would allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

''The current Bitcoin rally was much expected as we saw massive buying from retail and institutional investors during the July price dip. Bitcoin has emerged as the most resilient and lucrative asset class in modern human history and we are optimistic that crypto will become the first choice of investors who are looking to create long-term wealth and beat inflation,'' said Mr Thakral, CEO, BuyUcoin.

On Saturday, September 4, bitcoin was seen last trading 1.16 per cent lower at $50,116 against the US dollar, while ethereum - the world's second-largest cryptocurrency was last down 1.44 per cent at $3,906 against the greenback.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-04/q7d8b2k8_bitcoin_625x300_06_April_21.jpg',)",none

Many people are interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, but I remembered that they might not know how to get started.

Investing in cryptocurrencies is not the same as investing in stocks. You cannot buy or sell cryptocurrencies on many traditional investment brokerage platforms. And you need to have a way to save your crypto investment.

In this episode of Bull & Bear, If you are a beginner, we will show you how to start investing in cryptocurrencies.



Increasing inflow of cryptocurrencies

Despite their volatility Investor It is still piled up in cryptocurrencies as an investment.



In 2021 alone, more than $ 5.7 billion will flow into the crypto market, according to CoinShares. Bitcoin is responsible for most of its inflows for about $ 4.1 billion. Ethereum is approaching $ 1 billion with an influx of investors.

Since the beginning of the year, the assets under management of these cryptocurrencies have exceeded $ 56.8 billion.

In the week ending August 24, 2021, cryptocurrencies saw a total inflow of $ 24 million. Investors have invested more money in crypto for the second straight week than they were taking out.

This bullish source is primarily due to growing investor sentiment towards cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.

2021-09-04,Markets Insider,A father and son who help clients find forgotten crypto passwords estimate billions of dollars worth of lost bitcoin is recoverable,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/locked-crypto-wallet-password-recovery-cryptocurrency-chris-charlie-brooks-btc-2021-9,"Charlie and Chris Brooks run Crypto Asset Recovery, a small business in New Hampshire. Crypto Asset Recovery

A father and son team of computer programmers help people find lost passwords to their crypto wallets.

Chris and Charlie Brooks conducted an analysis that led them to estimate between 68,110 and 92,855 seemingly lost bitcoins are recoverable.

At current prices, the high end of the recoverable bitcoin estimate amounts to $4.7 billion.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

For Chris and Charlie Brooks, finding lost passwords to cryptocurrency wallets requires figuring out how their clients' minds work - and that effort can help their customers retrieve a slice of what the pair estimates is about $4.7 billion worth of recoverable bitcoin stranded in locked wallets.

""We get a really broad spectrum of clients. We have a client who is an early-stage miner in bitcoin who lost all of his information and he knows he's got some bitcoins somewhere … We get clients who were told in 2017 to buy into the hype-bubble and they bought $1,000 [worth] and they are looking for something to cover the rent,"" Charlie, a 20-year-old computer programmer who joined his father in running Crypto Asset Recovery based in New Hampshire, told Insider in a video interview.

""One of our most recent cracks had about $250,000,"" in a blockchain wallet, said Charlie, who majored in computer science in college. He's put school aside for now to work at the business. ""This is something I've always liked. I would follow along with my dad ... Online treasure hunting, it seemed really cool.""

Nearly 40% of 1,000 US crypto owners in a recent survey from Cryptovantage said they had lost wallet passwords and, on average, those unable to find their passwords lost $2,134.

The jumping-off point of the duo's estimate of what can be recovered was a Chainalysis estimate that up to 20% of 18.5 million existing bitcoin appear to be lost or stranded in locked wallets. The figures were cited in January by The New York Times in a story about a San Francisco-based programmer who couldn't find the password to the hard drive that stored his 7,002 bitcoin. After eight wrong guesses, he had two left to figure out the password before the virtual currency was likely lost forever.

The Chainalysis figure sparked a question for the Brookses.

""Yes, that bitcoin is lost but if the owner of that bitcoin were motivated, what percentage of those do we think is reasonable to assume could be recovered?,"" said Chris, a 50-year-old computer programmer who started his business in 2017 and, after some time retooling, ramped up operations late last year when his son came on board.

Nakamoto's forum

To find a sample of lost bitcoin for their analysis, Chris said they turned to a thread on BitcoinTalk, a forum whose creation is credited to bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. A thread started in 2011 called ""Let's add up the KNOWN lost bitcoins"" is filled with posts by people with the amount of bitcoin they lost and how it happened. The Brookses filtered and set parameters on the information, such as excluding losses of less than half of a bitcoin, to make an estimate on the sample population of the bitcoin reported lost.

The Brookses narrowed it all down to 72 posts that described the loss of at least half of a bitcoin. They determined that 14% are potentially recoverable cases and that from their own work in recovering wallets for clients, they can decrypt about 35% of passwords. That led to their conclusion that about 2.45% of lost bitcoin is retrievable. With a range between 68,110 and 92,855 bitcoins, that would make up to $4.7 billion in bitcoin recoverable based on the asset's price of about $50,372 on Friday.

Good guesses

""We get as good a list of passwords as we can from a client and then we put our heads together and spend some time extrapolating the way that they make their passwords and try to get in their mind when they are actually creating a password,"" said Charlie. ""That's the most helpful thing, just seeing their practice,"" he said. ""That's the cornerstone of our business, essentially.""

The duo will run ""hundreds of millions or billions of variations"" of password patterns and test those against the encrypted version of the wallet, said Chris.

""If you don't have a very good [password] guess, there are more possible passwords than there are atoms in the universe, and I'm not being facetious when I say that,"" Chris said.

The Brookses said decrypting times vary but occasionally can take as little as five seconds. That happened with a client whose list of nine potential passwords contained the correct one. Charlie said they worked for roughly a month and a half with the client who turned out to have about $250,000 in his wallet.

Security measures they take include having clients sign a contract stating they are the owner of the blockchain wallet being worked on. The two get paid on a sliding scale. Starting with wallets containing between zero and 10 bitcoins, or an equivalent value, the team will earn a 20% commission. There's no charge to clients if they can't recover any funds.

Chris said a number of their clients live in countries where people are largely unbanked.

""They may have a wallet with a couple of hundreds of dollars in it and that is their life savings. If they lose the password to it, they have no access to it anymore,"" said Chris. ""In some sense, it can be a heartbreaking piece of the business … we do crack some of [the wallets]. It's a balancing act to be helpful without going too far down a rabbit hole.""","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/6131ff9dee41b9001972273f?format=jpeg',)",none

2021-09-04,The Motley Fool,How Ethereum's Next Big Upgrade Could Boost Its Value,https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/04/how-ethereums-next-big-upgrade-could-boost-its-val/,"Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH)- the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, and the most popular smart contract and decentralized application network -- just changed the way it pays the people who maintain its network, in ways that could make it an even more appealing investment. When the next major evolution in its upgrade roadmap occurs, this change could reduce its supply and increase its value. That might be great news for investors seeking to hedge against inflation.

How Ethereum's changing its network

Since Aug. 5, a portion of the fees paid by users of Ethereum's network, which used to go toward making new coins with which to pay miners, has instead been burnt or destroyed. A total of 177,424 ETH, worth around $672 million at the time of writing, has been taken out of circulation since the upgrade, leaving 117.3 million tokens in circulation according to CoinMarketCap. By taking coins out of circulation, this change could make each existing coin more valuable.

Ethereum is currently produced by miners under a proof-of-work consensus mechanism that consumes a lot of energy, just like Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) production. It has a variable annual inflation rate of around 2.8% at the moment -- but it'll issue fewer new coins when it upgrades its network to a staking-based consensus.

Instead of solving tough math problems to keep the network running smoothly -- and getting rewarded for it -- Ethereum holders will be able to do the same things by storing away, or staking, some or all of their tokens. Around 6.2% of the circulating supply, or 7.4 million ETH tokens worth an estimated $28 billion, have already been staked. That staked ETH is currently earning an annual percentage yield of 5.8%, way more than any bank.

Once Ethereum's major upgrade occurs sometime in late 2021 or early 2022, one simulation estimates that the circulating supply of Ethereum could shrink by around 1.4% each year at current rates of fee burning. In theory, that might reduce the value of each token by an equal proportion. This means that the circulating supply of the asset will shrink.

Ethereum has way more use cases

Bitcoin is currently viewed as a store of value, or a safe haven asset to hedge against inflationary fiat currencies. But Ethereum is more of an economy -- a fledgling financial landscape for the internet.

Aside from staking, Ethereum is also the foundation for decentralized finance protocols, many of which are based on Ethereum and its smart contracts. These smart contracts, which run on the blockchain and execute when predetermined conditions are met, are also used to build decentralized applications (dApps).

Investors currently have 7.7 million ETH, or $29 billion, locked up in DeFi protocols for token swapping, yield farming, or liquidity mining. This is where token holders can provide collateral in crypto assets to earn more crypto assets.

Ethereum is also the standard for the majority of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, which have been booming in sales this year. NFTs are unique tokens on the blockchain that prove ownership; they can represent art, music, gaming items, avatars, and even real estate.

Additionally, Ethereum is the base layer for stablecoins -- digital assets pegged to a fiat currency. Around half of the world's most popular stablecoin, Tether (CRYPTO:USDT), is based on the Ethereum standard, with $34 billion worth residing on the network.

There's just one drawback to Ethereum's current popularity: Rising demand has inflated network fees, with the average transaction now costing $40. The currency's upcoming upgrade includes other improvements designed to lower those fees and speed up transactions, but for now, the higher fees make it harder for people and other apps to actually use Ethereum.

Why big banks are buying in

Ethereum's strengths compared to Bitcoin have driven Ethereum prices 400% higher since the beginning of 2021, compared to just 70% for Bitcoin.

Major institutions such as Grayscale have taken notice, and they're loading up on ETH. Institutional funds offer wealthy clients exposure to the asset without requiring them to hold it, and Grayscale currently holds $10 billion worth of ETH in its Ethereum Trust (OTC:ETHE).

Even some of the big Wall Street banks have leaned bullish on Ethereum. In July, analysts at investment bank Goldman Sachs said that Ethereum's real use cases give it the potential to become the dominant digital store of value in the coming years.

The network may also be viewed as a more environmentally friendly investment when it moves away from mining, which looks good to eco-conscious corporations.

Coupled with the prospect of supply deflation, these factors could drive an uptick in demand and prices. That trend might only grow stronger if the COVID-19 pandemic spurs inflation and currency devaluations on a global scale.

Increased regulation in the U.S., such as the controversial crypto tax reporting bill, could stifle innovation and mainstream Ethereum adoption in the short term. There is also the threat of faster rival blockchains such as Cardano or Polkadot becoming the de facto standard for smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps.

These networks have gained traction recently as the crypto ecosystem expands, but Ethereum has already cemented itself as the industry standard, just as IBM did with computing in the early 1980s. With so many platforms already running on Ethereum, and it having the largest support and developer community, it will be no mean feat to knock the network off its perch.

With this in mind, now might not be a bad time to buy and hold Ethereum for at least couple of years.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/641991/woman-using-ethereum.jpg',)",none

Witherspoon, however, did not disclose the amount she invested in Ethereum. As of September 4 (3:50pm IST), Ether price in India stood at Rs. 2.99 lakhs.

Just bought my first ETH! Let's do this #cryptotwitter — Reese Witherspoon (@ReeseW) September 2, 2021

Announcing her “love” for Bitcoin, Hilton shared a tweet by Michael Saylor, the largest corporate backer of the cryptocurrency. Saylor's post read, “Diamonds may be your best friend, but Bitcoin is forever.” As of September 4 (3:50pm IST), Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 38.23 lakhs.

The tweets have arrived as cryptocurrency prices leave behind the market crash it suffered in May, when most digital coins lost a huge chunk of their value, and appeared poised to rally again. Some coins are already showing signs of their determination. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin was trading above $50,000 (roughly Rs. 37 lakhs) on September 4, a gain of nearly $12,000 (roughly Rs. 9 lakhs) from a month ago. Similarly, Ethereum has gained more than $1,400 (roughly Rs. 1 lakh) since August 5.

Many people welcomed the two celebrities into the crypto world. Among them was YouTuber Logan Paul, who offered Witherspoon an NFT from the World of Women collection.

Hilton has for some time highlighted her support for Bitcoin. She had previously welcomed NFL legend Tom Brady “to the team” after he changed his profile picture to include laser eyes. The laser eyes mean that the person donning the look is 'laser-focussed' on seeing Bitcoin price reach the $100,000 (roughly Rs. 73 lakhs) mark.

So, we are all pushing for regulations in the sector as an industry, said, Founder & CEO,during ET Now's India Development Debate on the new crypto bill. Edited excerpts:Absolutely, I think that is a really positive step for the entire ecosystem. In fact, everyone is finally happy about this classification because before this it was all about putting crypto under one basic umbrella of currency and now there is finally talk about how to classify into various categories.So, asset or commodities is one of the many categories. There is also the obvious one: currency. But the majority of the use cases they fall under are utility. The fourth is a security. So, there are four major classifications of crypto and it is a welcome move for the entire industry. We are all excited; it is a great progress for the entire ecosystem.In terms of absolute numbers, I think on our exchange WazirX alone we have added more than 4 or 5 million people in – not even one year – under seven to eight months. That is a massive number of people entering the whole crypto ecosystem. As an industry we are now well over 15 to 17 million people in the whole ecosystem and that is just testament to the fact that everyone in India is looking forward to crypto as an asset class.Now your question about whether this is hampering growth. For sure, that is a yes. It is hampering growth, not just for one or two companies, but for the entire sector. Let us take for example investments in startups in the sector. India still ranks as one of the lower numbers compared to anywhere in the world like US and UK. In terms of even the number of start-ups that has grown large in India, it is considerably lower compared to the rest of the world.This is the regulatory uncertainty playing. Despite this, the growth and the number of people entering the ecosystem is really going well. But ultimately, we are in a financial sector and regulatory clarity brings in more investor confidence, which is the most important thing that this sector needs. So, we are all pushing for regulations in the sector as an industry.Not really. I think in fact that is a good point that you raised. I do not think crypto is trying to replace or compete with fiat currencies like the INR or the US dollar. What it is trying to do is fill the gaps on the internet which traditional currency does not really fulfil. There are lots of those opportunities that crypto is already existing. As simple as today, in the lack of regulation and no payment use case, the industry is still over $2 trillion in market cap and that itself just proves that crypto does not really need to come into the traditional payment mechanism.But it can fulfil payment use cases which traditional currencies do not. For example, cross-border payments that might be use case in remittance for India. That might be a use case that might emerge in the future. But again, as on today, the success of crypto currencies come in the use case where you need to pay for smart contracts on the block chains for example. There you cannot use traditional currency, so that is where majority of the use cases lie. That is where the progress is happening as on today. So, I do not really believe that the traditional payment use cases are something of a dampener. Cryptos cannot get into that.Look, the most important thing to understand out here is the largest age group – the demographic of people in crypto – is 23 to 30 years. This is the internet first population. If there is one thing they are really good at, it is extracting information online. I believe that most of them are well read and they understand. But apart from that, as an ecosystem what we are all doing is spreading the right information about crypto through education initiatives as an industry.We, in fact, also have an industry effort to self-regulate ourselves even in the absence of regulation. So, I think all of these are adding to an informed ecosystem. I do not really believe that we have a problem of misinformation. In fact, the misinformation tends to be more towards negative. There are people who think that India has banned crypto, which is not the case. So, there is no one who thinks that crypto is all regulated and it is all hunky-dory. People are coming with a view that it is still unregulated and the government has still not taken a hard position on that. So, let us invest cautiously. That is what a majority of people in the ecosystem have an outlook towards.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85923291,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-105105,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg',)",none

References to the feature were found by a developer named Alessandro Paluzzi, who said that “Twitter is working to allow you to add your Bitcoin and Ethereum address to your profile to receive tips via Tip Jar feature."" This, if and when rolled out, will be an update to the Tip Jar feature that was announced earlier this year.

Paluzzi shared on his Twitter a screenshot showing how users will be notified about being able to receive tips in cryptocurrency via the social media platform. While reports suggest that Twitter is using Strike’s services to generate Bitcoin invoices through the Lightning Network, Paluzzi says that it is not necessary to link a Strike account to add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to your profile. Following Paluzzi’s finding, Twitter’s product lead Kayvon Beykpour confirmed that the company is, indeed working on such a feature. Beykpour retweeted Paluzzi’s initial tweet, with a “soon"" emoji, hinting that the feature may come soon on the platform.

It is not clear as to how soon Twitter plans to roll out this feature for users. Given the trend, Twitter may initially roll out this feature for users in the United States only, as the adoption of cryptocurrencies is yet to reach or become mainstream in many regions.

Twitter recently rolled out the much-awaited Super Follow feature that allows creators and influencers on Twitter to charge their followers for exclusive content. This feature too, has started rolling out to users in US and Canada initially.

The new addition could be aimed to upgrade the Tip Jar feature that the microblogging network introduced earlier this year. Twitter is working on the ability to let users receive tips in Bitcoin through the Tip Jar feature. CEO Jack Dorsey in July suggested the implementation by calling Bitcoin a “big part” of the company's future in conversation with analysts and investors.

Mobile app developer Alessandro Paluzzi has found references about Twitter bringing the ability to let users add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their profiles. The developer posted a tweet that carried three screenshots to indicate the new options.

The first screenshot suggests that users would be able to copy Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to send tips in any of the two cryptocurrencies using the Tip Jar feature. In the second and third ones, Twitter appears to allow users to add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their profiles.

Alongside the screenshots suggesting the addition of Bitcoin and Ethereum address options, Paluzzi on Wednesday tweeted a screenshot to suggest the arrival of Bitcoin support to the Tip Jar feature. That tweet received a comment from Twitter's product lead Kayvon Beykpour that includes a lightning bolt emoji along with another saying “soon” to confirm its development and its imminent release.

Beykpour did not provide any further details about when exactly the ability to receive tips in Bitcoin through Tip Jar will be available to users. However, the screenshot posted by Paluzzi does suggest that Twitter would consider payment transfer technology The Lightning Network to allow tipping in Bitcoin on its platform.

The screenshot also suggested that Twitter would use Strike to generate Bitcoin Lightning invoices for the cryptocurrency tips users will get through the platform. Paluzzi on his newer tweet, though, says that users will not be required to link a Strike account for adding their Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses.

A report by MacRumor says that the work for Bitcoin tips has been suggested through Twitter for iOS beta code. It isn't available to beta testers at this moment, though.

In May, Twitter introduced its Tip Jar feature to let creators, journalists, and nonprofits monetise their tweets in the form of tips. The company initially enabled users to share links to their Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, Paypal, and Venmo accounts for receiving tips from their followers. That was, however, just the beginning as the platform appears to be adding cryptocurrencies as the new payment options.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has advocated cryptocurrencies for some time. In August, he said that Bitcoin would “unite a deeply divided country.” Dorsey during Twitter's earnings call in July also called the “big part” of Twitter's future.

“I think there's a lot of innovation above just currency to be had, especially as we think about decentralising social media more and providing more economic incentive,” he said while answering a question on how he sees Bitcoin becoming an integral part of Twitter.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/twitter_logo_main_pixabay_1620814744949.jpg',)",none
2021-09-04,Bitcoin News,European Citizens Reject EU-Imposed Crypto Regulation – Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/european-citizens-reject-eu-imposed-cryptocurrency-regulation/,"European Citizens Reject EU-Imposed Crypto Regulation

Most European citizens reject the idea of a cryptocurrency regulation regime imposed by the European Union (EU) on its member states, according to a recent survey. Most surveyed citizens lean towards independent cryptocurrency regulation in each country, compared to 25% that approve an EU-imposed regulation. However, most of the citizens polled acknowledged they still don’t know much about cryptocurrencies in the first place.

Europeans Reject EU Crypto Laws, Favor Local Proposals

European citizens are against the establishment of EU-imposed cryptocurrency-related laws, according to a recent survey ordered by Euronews. The poll, that was carried out by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, a global consulting firm, polled more than 31,000 citizens in 12 states of the European block: Germany, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Spain.

The survey found that most Europeans support locally issued laws instead of a set of rules imposed by the European Union. Citizens from Greece (51%), Italy (47%), Estonia (46%), Netherlands (41%), Germany (40%), Latvia (39%), and France (37%) said they would prefer their own government to regulate cryptocurrencies.

Also, a surprisingly high number of citizens would prefer the issuance of local cryptocurrencies instead of a digital euro, something that shows more and more Europeans blame economic inefficiencies on the European Union integration. Dimitar Lilkov, from the Wilfried Martens Center for European Studies in Brussels, stated:

A large part of the population remains convinced that the crisis was caused by poor decisions made at the EU level and not by serious deficiencies in its national banking sector.

However, the affiliation of each country with the EU impedes this from being a reality. Italians (41%), Greeks (40%), Estonians (39%), and Spaniards (37%) registered the highest support for the initiative. On this, Likov stated:

Eurozone countries that want to make use of a digital currency would be linked to a potential digital euro, led by the ECB in coordination with the eurozone banking system.

To him, any country issuing its own central bank digital currency would have to exit the EU in order to do so due to the possibility of a digital euro happening in the future.

Cryptocurrency Still Unknown

The survey also revealed that most European citizens have only just heard “a little” about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This shows that, even with the recent boom of crypto assets due to a bull season, there is still room for people to get better informed about cryptocurrencies and their proposals. In fact, the lack of knowledge about cryptocurrencies appears again in the survey as the main reason why Europeans have avoided purchasing crypto assets.

2021-09-04,Republic World,"Ethereum Competitor Solana Beats Dogecoin On Market Cap, Grows To $43 Billion",https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/other-tech-news/ethereum-competitor-solana-beats-dogecoin-on-market-cap-grows-to-43-dollars-billion.html,"Riding on the Ethereum surge, Solana (SOL) has now overtaken Dogecoin to become the seventh-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market valuation. SOL’s recent price rally saw it flip the crypto market’s valuation charts and put itself on to its new position with a market cap of around $43 billion. Solana recently ‘exploded’ and has been on the rise ever since. SOL has once again jumped over 25% in the last 24 hours to hit a new all-time high.

Solana surpasses Dogecoin on market cap

SOL, which was termed the ‘Ethereum killer’ by investors along with Cardano (ADA), has been the latest on the cryptocurrency bandwagon to mark a significant rise within days. The platform deals with blockchain-based smart contracts and the demand for the same has been on the rise lately. Ever since Ethereum’s recent update last month, Solana stacked explosive gains and climbed up the crypto market ranks.

Solana is now trading at around $150 and its market cap has grown by around $2 billion since Friday to reach $43 billion. Its closest competitor Dogecoin currently holds a market cap of $38.624 billion. SOL touched its all-time high in the last 24 hours and fell just off the mark as many investors began booking profit. However, the token seems to be on the rise back now.

Why is the Solana price surging?

It is a fact that all cryptocurrencies have been performing well in the market lately, but Solana has been the best of them. The “so-called” Ethereum Killer is indeed out-performing its competitors and is probably on the way to live up to its nickname. SOL is currently trading at $150, having rallied from $70 two weeks ago. It is no secret that Solana is currently the fastest cryptocurrency in the market, and its features keep getting improved by the makers.

Solana was founded in 2017 and deals on the Ethereum platform. Soon, Cardano (ADA) joined the race. Like the Ethereum and ADA, SOL supports smart contracts and is gaining popularity with developers building DeFi apps and creating NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

Among the three, Solana is the fastest by supporting nearly 70,000 transactions per second and that too at a meagre price. SOL, on its current trajectory, could even cross $175 in the coming months. Ethereum’s recent surge to cross the $4000 mark, since its big crash early this year, has played a major role in Solana’s rise.

2021-09-04,NDTV Gadgets 360,"Ether Price Briefly Tops $4,000 as Upgrade, NFT Momentum Gathers Pace",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-ether-price-ethereum-upgrade-nft-popularity-momentum-2529527,"Ether briefly rose above $4,000 (roughly Rs. 2,92,000) late Friday amid a monthlong surge around a major upgrade, and as demand for non-fungible tokens continues to widen.

The second-biggest cryptocurrency rose as high as $4,027 (roughly Rs. 2,93,900) on Friday before paring gains. It was at $3,914 (roughly Rs. 2,85,700) as of 12:06pm on Saturday in Hong Kong, trading at levels only reached previously in May. Ether has gained more than 50 percent since the end of July, with the Ethereum network's London upgrade early last month reducing supply increases.

As of September 4 (12:12pm IST), Ether price in India stood at Rs. 3.502 lakhs.

“Since the EIP-1559 upgrade one month ago, over 180,000 $ETH (equal to over $700 million or roughly Rs. 5,109 crores at current market prices) have been burned, resulting in continued disinflationary pressure on the Ethereum supply,” the Fundstrat crypto team wrote in a note Friday.

Ether has also done well amid continued interest in decentralised finance or DeFi, and NFTs – much of which use the Ethereum network. NFTs in particular have surged, with sales on major marketplace OpenSea rising more than 10-fold in August from the prior month.

Numerous cryptocurrencies have been performing well. Solana – now the seventh-biggest cryptocurrency – is up 68 percent in the past seven days and Polkadot has risen 27 percent, according to Coingecko.com. The overall crypto market cap is $2.36 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,72,26,737 crores), after bottoming at $1.24 trillion (roughly Rs. 90,51,336 crores) on July 20, CoinGecko data show.

“The breakout in Ethereum continued overnight, to levels last seen in May of this year, and cascaded into Cardano, Ripple and Polkadot,” said Martha Reyes-Hulme, head of research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange Bequant, in a note Friday.

Bitcoin hasn't seen the gains of its smaller peers, though it counted a success of its own recently by breaking through $50,000 (roughly Rs. 36,49,700 crores) again on Thursday. It's been holding near the level since, after spending more than a week sitting just under the key round-number level.

“Hold $50,000 and I expect Bitcoin to have another leg up to $60,000 (roughly Rs. 43,79,700) and test the April highs,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo. But Bitcoin “needs to start closing above $50,000 (roughly Rs. 36,49,700) and settle in the early 50s to temper concerns that this is a double top and we're heading down to $30,000 (roughly Rs. 21,89,800) again,” he said.

2021-09-04,Bitcoin News,Law Project Establishes Period to Decide Cryptocurrency Regulations in Brazil – Regulation Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/law-project-establishes-period-to-decide-cryptocurrency-regulations-in-brazil/,"Law Project Establishes Period to Decide Cryptocurrency Regulations in Brazil

A law project introduced in June in the National Congress of Brazil has jumped into the spotlight recently because it establishes a fixed period for the executive to start regulating cryptocurrency transactions. If approved, the proposal will establish the payment of taxes for cryptocurrency-based transactions. The project is being reviewed by the Chamber of Deputies and will have to be analyzed conclusively by the Finance and Taxation Committee.

Cryptocurrency Transactions to Be Regulated in Brazil

A law project proposal, Bill 2140/21, that was introduced to the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil in June, is now in the spotlight because it establishes a fixed period for the regulation of cryptocurrency transactions for the executive branch of the government. If approved, it would give a time limit of 180 days to devise all the necessary structures to regulate cryptocurrency transactions in an effective way. The project was presented by the deputy Alexandre Frota, part of the Partido de la Social Democracia Brasileña (PSDB).

Frota states that the absence of clear regulation for cryptocurrencies puts investors and the traditional financial system at risk, as crypto can aid in getting funds out of the country with no supervision. Frota declared:

With private and public banks, it is necessary to have rigorous regulation and inspection so that the population will not be deceived with promises of high individual profits, which has already happened to a great extent.

Brazil has been a country known for its crime associated with crypto-related scams in the last few years. The state has been fast to act when it comes to stopping these schemes, organizing several operations to shut down and arrest those responsible for illegal cryptocurrency-related activity over the last few months.

Taxes Could Be Coming

Another important part of the project states that operations carried out abroad must be scrutinized according to the same rules applied to banks, including taxation norms. However, it is still unclear how this might be carried out, due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions. This issue is currently being tackled by a special committee of the Chamber of Deputies.

However, Brazil is very much open to the issuance of a central bank digital currency. The Central Bank of Brazil is researching the creation of a Digital Real and debating if there is really a demand for such an instrument from the Brazilian population.

2021-09-04,The Economic Times,Cryptocurrencies vs Fixed Deposits: The debate dominating drawing rooms in India,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cryptocurrencies-vs-fixed-deposits-the-debate-dominating-drawing-rooms-in-india/articleshow/85920299.cms,"ET Exclusive: Here's how govt could tax your Cryptocurrency investment The main problem with the taxation of cryptocurrencies is that there is no clarity on what cryptocurrencies are. The tax department and investors are in a quandary over how to calculate gains on cryptocurrency. The draft bill tries to answer that. It will define cryptocurrency and will spell out what is allowed and what is not. Sachin Dave with exclusive details. Watch.

The Indian government and Indians have always been into savings. Unlike the westerners, India has high family values. The blood relations and family members are always there to support each other - also financially.The bread earner of the family saves for the future of the child(ren). In India, it is never like working for 40 hours a week, being paid as per the hours and chilling on the weekend and being broke by Monday morning. India's tradition of investment is a long term game that considers generations ahead.The Indian government realised this soon after independence and hence created a lot of schemes that come as retirement plans. The banks that come under the Reserve bank of India also come up with policies and plans to facilitate their customers into long term planning that involves minimum risk and a decent investment.Indians have been diverse in terms of their culture. But, the one thing that binds every Indian is the love for gold and silver . And again, traditionally speaking, gold is the symbol of Laxmi, the goddess of wealth. Gold is gifted to the bride and groom during the marriage. Gold is also worn as a piece of jewellery. Financially speaking, it is holding an asset that can be used in thick and thin for generations ahead.Another very popular financial instrument that Indians invest in is the FD or the fixed deposit. But with the new advancement of digital currency, will an average Indian adopt crypto? Let us see the differences and similarities.When you invest in FD, there are different sections under which you can invest your money in. For this investment that you declare, the government is notified of your strategy and you might get some consideration under tax benefit. On the other hand, the Indian government is not a too crypto pro, and hence, there is no tax exemption on the profits you make from investing in crypto.Government-supported: For creating an FD account with your bank, the steps are quite easy. A loaded bank account is good to go to create an FD account. While on the other hand, crypto investment requires you to create an account with a trading platform, that, in a normal case, is not encouraged by any government.As per the policy chosen by you, your bank and your tenure of FD, you are bound to get a fixed return. This usually does not change. Even if it does, it does not change too frequently. Also, the change in the percentage of return is not too much to give a shock to the investor. On the other hand, crypto rides a roller coaster. One moment the returns are doubled and the next moment you lose half of the money you invested. The frequency of change and the magnitude of change is humongous.FDs are long term plans and the entry and exit points are generally continuous till maturity. People generally do not exit their FD plan before it matures. No transaction happens and hence there is no transaction cost. On the contrary, since the crypto market is volatile, people make quick decisions. They enter, stay for some time, exit and then come back when the prices hit deep low. The number of entry and exit points is way too many and this incurs a lot of transactional costs.No need for any trading or exchange platform: For starting an FD account, you just need a bank account. And, having a bank account has been encouraged by the PM Jan Dhan Yojna. For investing in crypto, the user needs to have a verified account with a trading platform, link the bank account and then start to invest.FDs are an investment that people do not touch. People either start an FD for their retirement or they let it mature. The investment of crypto is not untouched. The amount ascertained for the investment in the crypto is every easily moved and circulated for investing in other cryptos or to encash into the local currency.FDs are long term plans. So is the crypto investment. But only pro-crypto investors understand this and are unshakable. Hence, even though both FD and cryptos are long term investment vehicles, many use the latter for short term gain.FDs are not rare. Do you want to open an account? Great! Go ahead. Do you want to mine bitcoin after 2140? Sorry, you cannot. Crypto comes with a finite supply and hence are rare. FDs are run on traditional money and we can have any number of traditional money notes as we want.This supports the above point. There is no mining or extra effort to convert your traditional money to be invested in FD. For cryptos, you need to mine new tokens to maintain their circulation or someone mines and sells them so that others can invest in them.FDs are the most secure, least risk involving financial planning method. Once you deposit money, you can forget it till it matures. Cryptos occupy the investors' time and attention. You lose your focus, you might lose a lot!As the inflation rate is higher, traditional instruments like FDs and RDs don't provide great relief. Even though crypto gets your heart beat faster, a person with good research on crypto can enter the market, stay for the time, make amazing money and exit intelligently. He/she doesn't wait for the 5-year tenure to get over.Indians love to invest money in the first place, love to invest for the long term and want their money to grow. While some people are risk-takers, some are more traditional. Investment strategies are like food choices. It depends from individual to individual. One that works for you might not work for your friend. Hence, it is always advisable to understand one's needs and wants and decide what best fits their goal.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85920307,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58030,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-09-04,NDTV,What Is A Cryptocurrency Exchange? How To Start Trading In It?,https://www.ndtv.com/business/cryptocurrency-exchange-how-do-cryptocurrency-exchanges-work-2527631,"For new investors, cryptocurrency is the buzzword. As much as it is promising in terms of giving returns over a short time, it is also volatile and risky. The whole idea of cryptocurrency is based on a distributed ledger that stores information on every transaction or trade. Also, the trade is protected by high-grade cryptography. The simplest way of investing in cryptocurrency is by trading (buying and selling) of any crypto coin like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Cadence, etc. These are done through online exchanges where investors open an account and start the trade.

What Is A Cryptocurrency Exchange?

These platforms facilitate cryptocurrency trading in exchange for digital and fiat currencies. They act as an intermediary between a buyer and a seller and charge a commission or transaction fee. CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber, and UnoCoin are some examples of online exchanges operating in India. An investor can also use an online exchange to convert their crypto coins back into fiat currency (Indian Rupee or US Dollar) for withdrawing the amount from their bank account later.

How Does It Work?

A cryptocurrency exchange acts like an intermediary – a brokerage firm – between a buyer and a seller of cryptocurrency. It allows a buyer to deposit money using several methods like direct bank transfer, UPI, using debit or credit cards, etc. It charges a set commission or fee for every transaction done using its services.

The first thing a buyer (or investor) will need to do is to find the right online exchange. This step will require a fair bit of research about the platform's history, credibility, and what benefits it will offer you for trading. The next step is opening a trading account, which is fairly simple.

Download an app of the exchange you have selected and create an account. It will ask you for some information like your email address. It will then send a verification email to that address and may also ask for KYC details. Verify the address on your email id and complete the KYC process. Then set a password on the app and you are set to launch yourself in the world of cryptocurrency.

Do not lose any passwords related to the app, wallet, or exchange. They may not be recovered.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/ogfsfjs8_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-09-04,HT Tech,"Cryptocurrency Ether hits $4,000 mark, but Bitcoin price slows rise",https://tech.hindustantimes.com/gaming/news/cryptocurrency-ether-hits-4-000-mark-but-bitcoin-price-slows-rise-71630731860752.html,"Ether briefly rose above $4,000 late Friday amid a monthlong surge around a major upgrade, and as demand for non-fungible tokens continues to widen. The second-biggest cryptocurrency rose as high as $4,027 on Friday before paring gains. It was at $3,914 as of 12:06 p.m. on Saturday in Hong Kong, trading at levels only reached previously in May. Ether has gained more than 50% since the end of July, with the Ethereum network’s London upgrade early last month reducing supply increases.

“Since the EIP-1559 upgrade one month ago, over 180,000 $ETH (equal to over $700 million at current market prices) have been burned, resulting in continued disinflationary pressure on the Ethereum supply,” the Fundstrat crypto team wrote in a note Friday.

Ether has also done well amid continued interest in decentralized finance or DeFi, and NFTs -- much of which use the Ethereum network. NFTs in particular have surged, with sales on major marketplace OpenSea rising more than 10-fold in August from the prior month.

Numerous cryptocurrencies have been performing well. Solana -- now the seventh-biggest cryptocurrency -- is up 68% in the past seven days and Polkadot has risen 27%, according to Coingecko.com. The overall crypto market cap is $2.36 trillion, after bottoming at $1.24 trillion on July 20, CoinGecko data show.

“The breakout in Ethereum continued overnight, to levels last seen in May of this year, and cascaded into Cardano, Ripple, and Polkadot,” said Martha Reyes-Hulme, head of research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange Bequant, in a note Friday.

Bitcoin hasn’t seen the gains of its smaller peers, though it counted a success of its own recently by breaking through $50,000 again on Thursday. It’s been holding near the level since, after spending more than a week sitting just under the key round-number level.

“Hold $50,000 and I expect Bitcoin to have another leg up to $60,000 and test the April highs,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo. But Bitcoin “needs to start closing above $50,000 and settle in the early 50s to temper concerns that this is a double top and we’re heading down to $30,000 again,” he said.","('https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2021/09/04/1600x900/2020-11-23T140031Z_977600602_RC229K9GLVG6_RTRMADP_3_CRYPTO-CURRENCIES_1607177306565_1607177319803_1630731930492.JPG',)",none
2021-09-04,,COCO Cocoin Cryptocurrency Top Community-Driven Limited Altcoin System Expanded,https://www.asiaone.com/business/coco-cocoin-cryptocurrency-top-community-driven-limited-altcoin-system-expanded,"Crypto Marketing Company announces the expansion of the Cocoin cryptocurrency system to introduce strategies developed from suggestions voted on by its investor community. These strategies will expand the token's foothold in the crypto space and provide perks for token holders.

—

As a highly-rated altcoin, Cocoin is capitalizing on its community-driven approach to launch innovations that are unique to the crypto space. Crypto Marketing Company has announced current and upcoming innovations including the establishment of a beverage production operation and the purchase of a private island for token holders.

Further information is available here: https://schooner.io/cocoin-finance

According to Crypto Marketing Company, the expansion will provide the Cocoin community with an intuitive deflationary cryptocurrency system that emphasizes community engagement as its long-term strategy and protects against common drawbacks of the crypto industry.

Cocoin’s system burns a consistent amount of coins at planned intervals to ensure effective control of the coin’s value over time. The system applies a 10% tax on all transactions and distributes the proceeds across its in-house charity fund, a liquidity pool, marketing and innovation initiatives, token holders, and other reserves. Higher tax requirements are placed on large transactions to protect token holders against investment whales who engage in “pump and dump” schemes.

Cocoin’s development team maintains a fully engaged communication system with its community of token holders. On the suggestion of community members, the team is currently considering plans to purchase a 12-acre private island for the use of members who have notable coin holdings.

The Cocoin team also considers promising member suggestions, such as the establishment of a COCO energy drink, an online store, a De-Fi exchange, and more. The Cocoin community is hosted on the Telegram app under the Group name “$COCO Community Official”, which can be accessed at: https://schooner.io/cocoin-community-official

About Cocoin

Cocoin is a woman-founded cryptocurrency token system led by digital marketing specialist Jessica, along with developers, Lorenzo and Arjan, and communications specialist Matthijs.

A spokesperson said, “Cocoin was founded by a team of 4 doxxed developers from The Netherlands. After 5 years of trading, we have not just gotten to read hundreds of contracts, we could understand exactly what it takes for a coin to succeed. We had seen enough scams, honeypots, and rug-pulls. COCO is a project for real people, by real people. We are here to change the game and to make a positive impact. Because only that way, we can prove them all wrong. Let’s go COCO.”

Cocoin has gradually built its reputation as a safe community-driven cryptocurrency system. Interested parties can find a link to its placement as one of the top 10 cryptocurrency picks from YouTube channel, Up Next Crypto here: https://schooner.io/top-ten-altcoin-pics-july-2021

2021-09-04,,"Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to Buy this Weekend, September 2021",https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-cryptocurrencies-to-buy-this-weekend-september-2021/,"Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to Buy this Weekend, September 2021

Here are the best cryptocurrencies to buy and invest in.

At this point, there isn’t anyone who has not heard of cryptocurrencies. From this year’s biggest cryptocurrency crash due to China’s ban to Elon Musk’s controversial tweets and companies accepting Bitcoin as payments, as each day passes, we are seeing the hype around cryptocurrencies grow in real-time.

While Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto sector, other promising altcoins are also making headlines as they are becoming investor favorites. So obviously, Bitcoin is not the only crypto option to invest in. So if you are planning on buying cryptocurrencies this weekend, to start off your crypto journey, here are the 10 best stocks you should consider.

1. Bitcoin

In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin is equivalent to gold. From retail investors to prominent businessmen, everyone is putting their trust in Bitcoins. After the massive market crash in April 2021 that led to Bitcoin trading at US$30,000, the digital coin has bounced back to trade at US$50,000. The main reason behind the value is scarcity. Only 21 million Bitcoins exist and out of that, about 19 million have already been mined.

2. Ethereum

Second to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the silver of the cryptocurrency market. Thanks to Ethereum’s network that supports DeFi, a lot of cryptocurrencies have innovated the “smart contract” concept. This utility feature has made Etherum the second-highest valued cryptocurrency in the market according to its market cap US$441.13 billion.

3. Cardano

There’s something about Cardano that attracts several experienced investors. Cardano was created as a “third-generation cryptocurrency” that can solve common crypto problems like scalability and security. While other cryptos borrowed codes from existing projects, Cardano was built from code by code. Its network can handle smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and anything else that exists in the crypto world.

4. Polkadot

Polkadot is a recently-launched cryptocurrency that got famous quickly. Polkadot was created with an intention to use the “proof of stake” network verification system which is touted as a better system than the “proof of work” that Bitcoin and Etherum uses. Polkadot can process multiple transactions which makes it scalable. The versatility of this network allows it to be used for smart contracts, file storage chains, and IoT chains to allow device-to-device communication.

5. XRP

XRP, made by Ripple Labs, aims to create a fast and secure payment system that works globally. One of the most reliable cryptocurrencies, it has a huge loyal investor base. According to the company, many financial institutions prefer this cryptos RippleNet service which uses the XRP crypto coins. XRP’s payment system has the capability to compete with legacy systems like SWIFT and convert crypto to any fiat currency.

6. Uniswap

Uniswap is a platform that has its own reward token called the UNI that works on the Ethereum network. The USP of these tokens is the fact that they can be exchanged among crypto users without trading them on centralized crypto exchanges like Binance. The USP is a hit as traders have been using the tokens, making it the best DeFi token by market cap.

7. Chainlink

Chainlink has a loft ambition for itself in the cryptocurrency market. Its purpose is to make a decentralized oracle network that can serve as a middleman between smart contracts and data sources. Basically, it makes smart contracts trustworthy by providing a secure, reliable link. It’s also a core part of the DeFi system. Due to its utility, The World Economic Forum named Chainlink one of the 100 most promising tech pioneers of 2020.

8. Stellar

The idea of cryptocurrencies is to simplify payments and Stellar’s mission aligns with that, to simplify cross-currency transfers. For that, this crypto network has partnered with International Business Machine Inc to create IBM World Wire. This collaboration enables fast currency transfer services to financial institutions across the world.

9. Dogecoin

Elon Musk’s tweets revived this meme coin that was supposed to be forgotten by the world. Dogecoin didn’t have any purpose until billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of Dallas Mavericks, decided that the NBA team would accept Dogecoin as payment. Such celebrity incidents now made Dogecoin one of the most anticipated cryptos.

10. Aave

Aave’s purpose is to complete the lack of borrowing and lending applications on Ether’s network. For this utility, Aave has now become a DeFi pioneer. This crypto has nearly US$5 billion worth of locked assets, which amounts to a third of the total market.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Top-10-Cryptocurrencies-to-Buy-this-Weekend-September-2021.jpg',)",none

2021-09-04,Todayuknews,Japan’s Financial Giant SBI to Launch Cryptocurrency Fund – Finance Bitcoin News,https://todayuknews.com/crypto-currency/japans-financial-giant-sbi-to-launch-cryptocurrency-fund-finance-bitcoin-news/,"Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings is reportedly launching a crypto fund that will invest in several cryptocurrencies. “I want people to hold it together with other assets and experience firsthand how useful it can be for diversifying portfolios,” said an executive of the company.

SBI Holdings Launching Crypto Fund

SBI Holdings Inc. has revealed its plan to launch a cryptocurrency fund by the end of November, Bloomberg reported Thursday, calling it the country’s first crypto fund.

Tomoya Asakura, director of SBI Asset Management and president of SBI affiliate Morningstar Japan, explained that the fund will invest in a number of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, and litecoin.

He added that the fund is aimed at customers who understand the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including their high volatility. In addition, there may be a minimum investment of about one million yen ($9,122) to three million yen.

Asakura noted in a recent interview that if the first fund “goes very well,” then the firm would like to “move quickly” to launch a second fund. He opined:

I want people to hold it together with other assets and experience firsthand how useful it can be for diversifying portfolios.

SBI is also considering launching another fund specifically tailored to institutional investors if there is enough demand for the product, the executive noted.

Due to strict crypto regulations following hacking incidents at exchanges in Japan, it has taken SBI four years to get its crypto fund off the ground, the publication conveyed. It added that the company had to change its plan of how the fund is offered to investors to comply with regulations.

SBI initially planned to launch its crypto fund as an investment trust, a popular investing method in Japan. However, the country’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), banned companies from selling crypto investments using this method. The company then changed its plan and will offer its crypto fund to investors using a vehicle known as an “anonymous partnership.”

Asakura noted that “There is an overwhelming perception that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and speculative.” He plans to build a track record to show the public and regulators that cryptocurrencies can help investors diversify their portfolios.

2021-09-04,Delta Optimist,Police in Delta issue warning after cryptocurrency investors scammed,https://www.delta-optimist.com/local-news/police-in-delta-issue-warning-after-cryptocurrency-investors-scammed-4304883,"There is a lot of interest in investing in cryptocurrency; but at the same time, scammers are capitalizing on that fact

The news stories are enticing. Bitcoin valuation reaches new highs. Eretheum, Dogecoin up 10 per cent.

There is a lot of interest in investing in cryptocurrency; but at the same time, scammers are capitalizing on that fact, and many are taking advantage of investors’ lack of knowledge on how to invest in this market.

In recent months six complaints have come into Delta Police about residents being scammed when they tried to invest in crypto currencies.

Their losses have been significant, ranging from just under $5,000 to more than $100,000 in one file. Most of the files have been in August, which has led to DPD issuing this warning.

“If you are going to invest in cryptocurrency, be very cautious,” says Const. Dustin Classen, of the DPD cybercrimes section.

Classen points out that in the files that were reported, there is no chance for the investors to recoup their losses.

There are a number of common factors in the reported files:

In most files the scammers contacted the would-be investors through a variety of online platforms, from dating sites to chat apps. An online “relationship” was established.

Investors clicked on an ad in two files, which lead them to an illegitimate company.

Investors were typically encouraged to e-transfer funds from their bank accounts to mobile wallets, and from there to unknown accounts. In some cases the scammers walked the victims through the process online, even having the victim download software to allow the scammer access to their computer.

When victims tried to withdraw their “profits” or investment, the money was either gone, or the victim was informed they needed to pay considerable additional fees to access their money.

“I would advise investors to check the url or domain or the investment website, and do their homework,” added Classen. “Is the investment firm well established, and reputable?”

The British Columbia Securities Commission also offers good advice and tips for investors on their website www.investright.org, including a video which explains the scams in greater detail.

Investors can check specific investment companies, to determine if they are subject to investigation by the BC Securities Commission.

And Canadian Securities Administrators runs a site to check the registration of securities industry professionals - http://aretheyregistered.ca/.

In response to a question from Zhu Su, the CEO of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, on what improvements he would want to see in Dogecoin, Buterin says he hopes that the memecoin can transition from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, as Ethereum is doing.

Su asked the question after Buterin launched an Ask-Me-Anything on Twitter.

“Personally, I hope that doge can switch to PoS soon, perhaps using Ethereum code.”

The Ethereum co-founder also hopes that Dogecoin remains an inflationary coin. Currently, only five billion Dogecoin can be mined annually.

According to Buterin, the new Dogecoin supply should be stored in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) which spends on global public goods.

“I also hope they don’t cancel the 5b/year annual PoW issuance, instead they put it in some kind of DAO that funds global public goods. Would fit well with Dogecoin’s non-greedy wholesome ethos.”

In an answer to a question on monetary theory, Buterin says he has been “thinking about the long-term future of UoA [unit of account] stability.”

Buterin says that there is a “big chance” that Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) will remain volatile even after cryptocurrencies have achieved wide adoption. Consequently, he says stablecoins might be needed indefinitely.

“Some people think stablecoins are purely transition tech, and post-hypercryptoization BTC or ETH will be stable. I think there’s a big chance this is wrong and even post-hypercryptoization we would still need explicit stablecoins.”

2021-09-04,NewsBTC,"As Ethereum Approaches $4k, On-chain Data Shows Rally Will Continue Even Higher",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-4k-rally-continue-higher/,"Even with Ethereum’s strong run where the coin has reached near $4k, on-chain data shows there is still more room for the bull rally to continue.

Ethereum All Exchanges Taker Buy Sell Ratio Shoots Up

As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the ETH all exchanges taker buy sell volume has shown a huge spike today.

The Ethereum all exchanges taker buy sell ratio (or volume) is an indicator that shows the ratio between long volume and the taker seller volume.

Now, common sense says, since every trade needs a buyer and a seller, how can there exist a difference between the two quantities?

Well, to understand the concept of taker buy and sell volumes, the idea of taker and maker needs to be understood first. Quoting the CryptoQuant data guide:

Taker: Taker trade refers to an order that is traded before going on the order book. All market order trades are takers. Maker: Maker trade refers to an order that goes on the order book (e.g. a limit order). These orders add volume to the order book, helping to ‘make the market’.

When these takers buy ETH at the price set by makers, the amount of coins traded contributes to the taker seller volume. This volume is referred to as “seller” because it can drive the prices down.

On the other hand, takers selling to makers at the ask price can push the prices up, thus contributing to the buyer volume.

The ratio between these two volumes is precisely the taker buy-sell ratio. If the taker buy volume is higher than the sell volume (that is, the value of indicator is above one), it means more trades are occurring at the ask price. This shows there is more demand and so the prices go up.

Now, here is a chart that shows how the value of this metric looks like for Ethereum right now:

The ETH metric spikes up | Source: CrytpoQuant

A high value of the indicator such as right now suggests the Ethereum taker buy volume is greatly overwhelming the sell volume.

A similar spike was seen in the middle of August, and the price moved up in response. So, if the indicator is to be believed, the current high value might also result in further movement upwards.

ETH Price

At the time of writing, Ethereum floats just under $4k, up 22% in the last seven days. Monthly gains for the coin are around 47%.

2021-09-04,US News Money,How Blockchain Can Transform the Financial Services Industry,https://money.usnews.com/investing/cryptocurrency/articles/how-blockchain-can-transform-the-financial-services-industry,"Blockchain has the potential to make the financial services industry more transparent, less susceptible to fraud and cheaper for consumers. (Getty Images)

Blockchain technology is one of the leading innovations in the finance industry, holding promise to reduce fraud, ensure quick and secure transactions and trades, and ultimately help manage risk within the interconnected global financial system.

Blockchain accomplishes this through advanced cryptography that is designed to be resistant to hacking, adding trust to the transaction ecosystem.

There are many financial uses provided by blockchain, not limited to keeping track of transactions and trades. As our global financial system becomes more connected in our age of digital transformation, investors would be well advised to learn about how blockchain is changing the system and how to gain and regulate exposure to this development.

Here's what investors should know about blockchain's growing role in financial services and the earning potential and risk factors it poses, from tech-oriented startups to traditional banks:

What is blockchain?

Benefits of blockchain in financial services

Risks that blockchain and financial institutions face

Blockchain investments to buy

What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a digital collection of transactions that are tracked and recorded in a decentralized network. It is a distributed ledger, which means there is no central authority of the network, or no one person or entity in control with the ability to corrupt the network. The blockchain comprises individual blocks of data, each containing a record of information, that are linked together in chronological order. These links cannot be changed, which is what instills confidence in the network.

This revolutionary technology manages transactions of information by securing them as they occur. The purpose of blockchain is to lower the cost of transactions and make them more efficient and faster.

The technology has many applications that can be integrated into different industries, providing investors with many opportunities. For starters, it's one of the technological underpinnings of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

One industry with clear applications for the blockchain is financial services, where companies are in a perpetual race to reduce the costs and friction of transactions.

Benefits of Blockchain in Financial Services

Blockchain has the potential to make the financial services industry more transparent, less susceptible to fraud and cheaper for consumers.

Improving transparency. Blockchain can make the financial industry more transparent since users are performing activities on a public ledger. This transparency can expose inefficiencies like fraud, leading to problem-solving that could reduce risk for financial institutions.

Adding security. As consumers become increasingly active online, the digital universe is a breeding ground for scammers. With blockchain technology, this concern could be reduced. Payments and money transfers made on the blockchain are faster and more traceable than in traditional banking.

When information flows through different financial intermediaries, there is a risk of interception of that information, raising the possibility of fraud. This hole in oversight can be filled with blockchain's cryptographic algorithms that bring security in the exchange of information between parties.

""In traditional finance, clean audit trails can be difficult to procure at times, which have led to severe economic losses in the past due to negligent behavior or malicious actors,"" says Ben Samaroo, co-founder and CEO at WonderFi, a decentralized finance platform. ""This risk can be significantly reduced with a combination of blockchain technology and machine learning to monitor and manage risks with a high degree of precision.""

Financial technology companies other businesses that use large amounts of data need blockchain to build data integrity.

""Since the blockchain network is distributed, it doesn't have a single source of failure,"" says Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer at Gate Technology, a cryptocurrency exchange based in China.

This characteristic, Tatibouet says, increases the network's resilience, protecting it from compromise.

Lowering costs. As investors move away from financial advisors to avoid higher fees, blockchain provides an opportunity for consumers to benefit from lower costs associated with traditional financial services.

Financial technology companies have become a huge part of the financial services industry, allowing investors to open accounts with digital advisors and make independent financial decisions. As fintech plays a stronger role in global finance, its relationship with blockchain will inevitably become stronger.

This innovation can be good for consumers because investors are getting more for their money and they're getting a balance between automation of financial services and a lower cost.

""The institutions that adopt this new technology first will be able to streamline internal processes and provide their customers with lower-cost financial services, effectively beating their competitors on cost to capture a larger portion of the market,"" Samaroo says.

This ultimately benefits the everyday investor who's looking to cut expenses while accessing this new financial services environment.

Risks that Blockchain and Financial Institutions Face

Weighing against the promise blockchain holds for financial institutions is one major risk affecting the bottom line: Traditional financial institutions make money on transaction fees that could be lowered or eliminated with blockchain technology.

When it comes to transferring money, consumers have to rely on banks or third parties to process transactions.

But adoption of blockchain could bypass third parties such as banks, which would eliminate fees and other costs associated with these services. As a result, banks may face challenges in volume and transaction-based revenue.

Blockchain makes the infrastructure that's proprietary to financial institutions less important because it serves as a verification mechanism that's ""not concentrated in the power of one institution,"" says Thomas Shohfi, assistant professor in the Lally School of Management at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.

In addition, blockchain innovation is moving so fast that regulation hasn't caught up yet. So the potential policies impacting blockchain can be seen as another obstacle in incorporating blockchain in financial services.

""Existing regulation does present a significant obstacle for blockchain adoption since regulators will prioritize existing incumbents over disruptors,"" Tatibouet says.

Regulators are working through determining the pros and cons of blockchain technology to see if it's suitable for financial institutions and what the consequences are for companies and consumers.

""This rigidity has stifled innovation so far,"" Tatibouet says. ""However, this view is changing as governments and other public organizations are seeing the benefits of this technology.""

Blockchain Investments to Buy

For investors who want exposure to blockchain as it changes the financial services industry, there are a few ways to approach this investment. One way is to buy into companies whose businesses are tapped into blockchain technology.

""Financial companies or technology companies that see blockchain as a disruptive technology and want to be experts in it can sell their services to customers,"" Shohfi says.

A company that falls in this category is International Business Machines Corp. (ticker: IBM), which is focused on the development of blockchain technologies. IBM also provides services for businesses to integrate blockchain for efficiency, scalability and growth.

Another approach investors can take is investing in cryptocurrency-oriented stocks that serve as a pure play for blockchain investments. MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) fits the bill here. The software solutions company holds more than 105,000 bitcoins, a portfolio valued at more than $5 billion.

Square Inc. (SQ) is another company that's heavily invested in Bitcoin and strongly believes in the blockchain network. The payment services company recently announced that it will launch a decentralized finance platform with a focus on Bitcoin applications.

Investors are taking notice of these stocks and their potential. MicroStrategy is up about 80% year to date, and Square has seen a year-to-date rise of 23%. That's compared with the S&P 500's year-to-date return of about 20%. Investing in these publicly traded companies allows you to broadly invest in the blockchain without having direct exposure to the volatility and speculation associated with some cryptocurrencies.","('https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/89cc057/2147483647/crop/2096x1398%2B0%2B0/resize/970x647/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.beam.usnews.com%2Fa0%2F4c%2F5d53326d407b99b8a971d0a33326%2F210903-stock.jpg',)",none
2021-09-04,The Motley Fool,"Why Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum -- and Coinbase, Too -- Are Moving Today",https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/03/why-bitcoin-dogecoin-ethereum-coinbase-moved/,"What happened

As the week draws to a close, cryptocurrency prices are looking decidedly mixed in Friday morning trading. Here's how prices for several of the biggest names in cryptocurrency stand as of 10:10 a.m. EDT:

Crypto industry bellwether Bitcoin CRYPTO:BTC)

Trader darling Dogecoin CRYPTO:DOGE)

Ethereum CRYPTO:ETH)

And for that matter, crypto marketplace Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is up as well -- 2.2%.

So what

Meanwhile, the headlines on cryptocurrencies look just as mixed.

As Coindesk reports this morning, China -- whose crackdown on cryptocurrencies sparked a panic and crashed crypto prices early in the summer -- appears to be done wielding the hammer. China ""has completed rectification"" of the crypto market, reports Coinbase, and now that most crypto mining hubs in the country have been shut down, and the government has told financial institutions to refrain from ""conducting or enabling virtual currency transactions and trading,"" no further regulations on cryptocurrencies are anticipated.

Granted, the regulations already passed appear to have basically removed the world's most populous nation from the cryptocurrency market, which won't be good for growth trends. But at the very least, China doesn't seem to be planning to wreak any further havoc on the market -- and so crypto investors can heave a sigh of relief on that score.

And there's further news today from the world's second most populous nation. As India's The Economic Times reports, Indian legislators are hard at work on a new bill that will break cryptocurrencies into one of three categories: those used for investment, for payments, or serving as a form of ""utility."" The bill will also, if it becomes law, classify all cryptocurrencies as a form of commodity asset.

Now what

Is this good news or bad news? Well, when you consider that barely a week ago, The Economic Times was wondering aloud whether the Indian government might ban cryptocurrencies entirely, the fact that now the government just wants to regulate and even institutionalize crypto has to be seen as a positive.

I'd even go so far as to say that, even with India's bill not yet passed into law, the change in sentiment here is a good one for cryptocurrency investors. In India as in the U.S., while crypto traders might buck at the idea of government interfering with their fun, well-thought-out regulations have the potential to cut down on fraud and abuse that might scare serious investors away from investing in cryptocurrency. Regulation has the potential, too, to calm price swings and volatility in this market, transforming crypto into more of an investment and less of a speculation.

If you ask me, that's a good thing -- and a reason for crypto prices to rise.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/641943/red-arrow-going-down-crosses-a-green-arrow-going-up.jpg',)",none
2021-09-04,The Daily Hodl,Legal Expert Says Ethereum Complicates SEC’s Case Against Ripple – Here’s How,https://dailyhodl.com/2021/09/03/legal-expert-says-ethereum-complicates-secs-case-against-ripple-heres-how/,"A legal expert who is closely covering the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case against Ripple believes Ethereum (ETH) could play a key role in the courtroom battle.

The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020 alleging that the San Francisco-based firm sold XRP as an unregistered security.

ADVERTISEMENT

Attorney Jeremy Hogan tells his 131,900 followers on Twitter that the case is becoming more complicated after Ripple raised the question on whether or not Ethereum (ETH) itself is a security.

The lawyer explains why answering the question is difficult for the SEC.

“If the answer is ‘no,’ then it opens the door for Ripple to compare XRP to Ether. And as we know, only Ethereum had an ICO…

‘Yes,’ is not a politically fathomable answer for the SEC.”

The dilemma arises from a 2018 statement made by William Hinman, then director of SEC’s division of corporation finance, who said that Ethereum doesn’t count as a security, and that offers and sales of ETH are not actual securities transactions.

But in his deposition in July, Hinman said that he warned a Ripple official that he considered XRP as an unregistered security.

Hogan says he believes bringing up the classification of ETH is a winning stance for Ripple.

“If the SEC answers ‘Is Ether a security?’ with ‘We have not determined yet,’ which is what I think the answer will eventually be from them, then that plays into the Ripple’s fair notice defense argument.

For Ripple, the ‘Is Ether a security?’ question is a win, win?, or win.”

2021-09-04,Cointelegraph,"Ethereum price spikes to a 3-month high above $4,000",https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-price-spikes-to-a-3-month-high-above-4-000,"Ether (ETH) returned to $4,000 on Sept. 3 for the first time since May as a solid week of gains culminated in a major price milestone.

Against month-to-date gains of $600, the pair reclaimed the historic level it had lost in the dramatic trend reversal that rocked the cryptocurrency market roughly three months ago.

In so doing, Ether broke out of its three-month trading zone, with $4,025 just $350 away from all-time highs.

In terms of weekly performance, Ether took third place out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, behind Solana's SOL and Polkadot's DOT tokens.

Bitcoin (BTC) also capitalized on fresh strength of its own, rallying to a critical resistance at $51,000.

How long can the good times last?

Ether's successes have given bulls reason to rejoice, but the move has also produced some murmurs from critics.

With gas fees still causing frustration for traders, there was a sense of disparity as even actress Reese Witherspoon announced that she had invested in Ether.

Broadly, however, opinions converged that the final months of 2021 may mimick the rush to the finish of 2013 and 2017.

""Regardless of when exactly it comes the next few months will probably be insane beyond what most of you can imagine, but also one day during all that mania the music will stop,"" popular Twitter account Lark Davis summarized in a dedicated thread on the current crypto bull market.

About Cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.

Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain that serves as a public financial transaction database.

2021-09-04,,"In Tether Hack, US$3.1 Million Worth of Cryptocurrency Stolen from Taiwanese Antique Dealer",https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/in-tether-hack-us3-1-million-worth-of-cryptocurrency-stolen-from-taiwanese-antique-dealer-301368946.html,"CHIAYI, Taiwan, Sept. 3, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- In what is likely the biggest digital theft in the history of decentralized finance in Taiwan, hackers have stolen about US$3.1 million worth of the cryptocurrency Tether from an antique dealer in Taiwan named Liu Kun-Hung.

According to local law enforcement officials in Chiayi, Taiwan, this cryptocurrency was being held in two Tether accounts in the United States, after Liu had made a US$3.1 million payment to the trader in that cryptocurrency.

In early July, Liu noticed that three transfers had been made from his Tether accounts to an unknown cloud wallet. However, neither he nor any of his associates who had access to Liu's accounts had made any such transactions.

Liu immediately changed the passwords to his accounts several times, but even that didn't stop the unauthorized transfers. He then reported the cyber theft case to the police. By that time, however, hackers had already relocated the stolen cryptocurrency to 5 different cloud wallets and emptied US$500,000 in cryptocurrency from one the accounts.

""They (the hackers) can steal our personal information from anywhere: from staff or employees, from the communication apps that we use, or even from the platform used to open the account in Taiwan,"" stated Liu. According to Liu, despite the fact that he changed his passwords several times and that an authorization code is required to make a transaction, the hackers were still able to access his accounts and conduct the heist.

Liu also filed a notice about the unauthorized activity with Tether. Eventually, representatives there were able to freeze the remaining US$2.6 million in the 4 unknown cloud wallets.

According to Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau, investigators have already identified the hacker's internet protocol address, and this address is linked to a cloud-service provider in New Taipei City, Taiwan.

The police have stated while the case is still under investigation, based on the information obtained in the initial probe, it appears that the hackers stole the password and vital account information by hacking into the cell phone(s) of Liu's and/or his employees.

""I won't be the last victim,"" Liu declared. ""Digital currency uses the most advanced technologies and is supposed to be resilient and powerful in protecting vital information—security is one of the top reasons that we invest in it."" He continued, ""But apparently that is not the case here. So far, I've been very disappointed and frustrated, and I strongly urge Tether and its related operators to help protect others, especially foreign investors like me.""

Like Bitcoin, Tether is a cryptocurrency. In fact, it's the world's third-biggest digital coin by market value. Tether, however, is very different from other virtual currencies. Launched in 2014, Tether is known as a ""stablecoin,"" which is a type of digital currency that is tied to real-world assets—such as the U.S. dollar—in order to maintain a stable value.

Cryptocurrency has become a popular method of investment, but its volatility and lack of regulation has also attracted criticism. According to cryptocurrency experts, market leaders like bitcoin and Ethereum continue to attract interest at the current time.

David Weliver, founder of Money Under 30, told Express.co.uk: ""The number of different cryptocurrencies continues to grow – last I checked the popular crypto trading platform Coinbase tracks close to 100 different currencies.

""The original cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is still something of a proxy for the entire crypto market and has a total market cap of nearly $1trillion as of September 1, 2021.

""The feature that makes bitcoin so intriguing as a currency replacement is the hard cap on bitcoin supply.

2021-09-04,Goodreturns,Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Is Skyrocketing, India Stands Second,https://www.goodreturns.in/news/global-cryptocurrency-adoption-is-skyrocketing-india-stands-second-1222291.html,"Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Is Skyrocketing; India Stands Second Business oi-Sneha Kulkarni

On Friday, Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipped below $50,000 to retest support, an ""important"" move for assessing whether the bullish trend will continue.

India's interest in the Indian crypto ecosystem is increasing. In Chainalysis' Global Crypto Adoption Index for 2021, India was just rated second. For capital creation, Indian blockchain businesses have begun to acquire cash flows from worldwide markets.

According to Chainalysis' ranking methodology, countries are ranked based on their P2P trade volume, which is weighted to favor countries with lower purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita and fewer internet users, in order to highlight countries where residents are investing a greater portion of their overall wealth in P2P cryptocurrency transactions.

As a result, both China and the United States saw their P2P trade volume weighted for internet-using population drop drastically over the year, causing them to drop in the global adoption index ranks. It also reflects the rising cost of living.

India's crypto businesses have raised more than $100 million in funding, with CoinDCX being the country's first crypto unicorn and Polygon becoming the country's first major protocol play.

The advent of decentralized finance (DeFi), which has finally provided India's brilliant developers a product-market fit for technical and core crypto goods, is a significant driver for this growth and investor interest.

Regulators have long threatened to seize the bank accounts of Indian venture firms and investors. The initial coin offering (ICO) craze of 2018 also sparked widespread perceptions of crypto projects as ""scams,"" a perception echoed by regulators in the country.

2021-09-04,India Today,"Cryptocurrencies likely to be treated as commodities, may face taxation: Report",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/cryptocurrency-draft-bill-details-taxation-classification-of-virtual-coin-1848885-2021-09-03,"The much-awaited cryptocurrency draft bill may propose to define cryptocurrencies and classify them based on usage. The move is likely to benefit Indian cryptocurrency investors who have been waiting for a concrete law to regulate virtual coin trading.

Cryptocurrencies could be defined as commodities or assets in the new draft bill, reported The Economic Times after speaking to people aware of the development. The draft bill may also propose taxation for cryptocurrencies including laws for payments, investments and other utilities, added the report.

While the government had earlier said it would not go for an outright ban on cryptocurrencies, it has not yet provided any clarity on how it plans to deal with virtual coin trade in India.

Check today's cryptocurrency prices

However, cryptocurrencies may be categorised as per the technology they use in the new draft bill. But the primary focus of the government will be based on end-usage of the assets for regulatory purposes, according to the ET report.

TAX TREATMENT, OTHER RULES

The new draft bill is also expected to determine how taxes will be levied on cryptocurrency investments.

A person quoted in the ET report said the government’s draft crypto bill aims to define cryptocurrency and its treatment in various use cases. This will help authorities register cryptocurrency trade in the books of accounts and tax accordingly. However, the government may not be looking to allow payments and settlements through virtual currencies through its bill.

Also Read | IMF warns nations against adopting crypto assets as legal currency. Here’s why

More clarity is needed on whether cryptocurrencies will be treated as commodities, services or similar to equities; only then can virtual coins be taxed or regulated. This is why the government’s primary goal is to define cryptocurrencies in its draft bill. Simply put, a clear definition of cryptocurrency is required to figure out how it will be regulated and taxed in future.

However, sources quoted in the ET report indicated that the government could apply something similar to security transaction tax (STT) on cryptocurrency trade. If they are categorised as commodities, the returns or gains made by investors could also be taxed as business income at normal income tax rates.

WHY CRYPTOCURRENCY BILL IS IMPORTANT

The development comes at a time when cryptocurrency trade is growing rapidly in the country. Domestic cryptocurrency exchanges have reported a sharp jump in trading volumes, and they have also requested the government to regulate virtual coin trade rather than imposing a ban.

Cryptocurrency exchanges in India have said numerous times that the country needs to recognise cryptocurrency tokens as digital assets rather than currencies, and subsequently, clarify policies related to crypto trade.

As of now, cryptocurrency does not have any legal status in India and are unregulated. The proposed crypto bill is likely to define the future of virtual coin trade in the country.

People in the know said only the cryptocurrencies that are covered under the government’s definition will be allowed to be traded in India.

The company had launched the feature earlier this year, allowing users to tip influencers for their tweet. So far, Twitter has allowed users to add payment modes like Razorpay, PayPal and others to their accounts.

Italian developer Alessandro Paluzzi tweeted screenshots showing that Twitter will allow influencers to add ethereum and bitcoin addresses to their Tip Jar accounts soon. Paluzzi’s tweet, of course, doesn’t confirm the feature. But it was also retweeted by Kevin Beykpour, product lead at Twitter.

Beykpour’s retweet doesn’t necessarily mean he’s confirming the feature, but he did add a lightning emoji and a sign that says ‘soon’ in his tweet. The feature has also been reported by Macrumours earlier. On August 31, the publication reported that the ability to add bitcoin and ethereum wallet addresses to Tip Jar accounts has been spotted on Twitter’s beta version as well.

Additionally, bitcoin being a “big part"" of Twitter’s future was confirmed by Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, during the company’s earnings call in July this year. Dorsey himself has been a big supporter of cryptocurrencies, having spent over $23 million in February to establish a 500 BTC fund alongside rapper Jay-Z, which would be used to promote development in countries like India and Africa.

Dorsey’s payments platform, Square, has also laid out its plans to include cryptocurrencies within its platform. Square had invested over $170 million in bitcoin in February this year, and had also made an investment in October 2020.

2021-09-04,NDTV Gadgets 360,Cryptocurrency Investment 101: How to Calculate Moving Average and Why is it Important,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/moving-average-calculate-cryptocurrency-investment-trading-tools-tips-dogecoin-how-to-2528622,"Moving average in the field of finance — including cryptocurrencies — is a stock indicator commonly used by investors for technical analysis. Among the most important reasons for the calculation of a moving average is to mitigate the impact of sometimes random or short-term fluctuations in the prices of any stock — and cryptocurrencies are especially prone to extremes. The other reason, of course, is to constantly update the average price of a stock for a selected period of time. It is also referred to as a lagging indicator as it is based on the past prices of a given stock.

And just like it is used for any other stock, moving average also helps an investor analyse the trend of a cryptocurrency not just in the present but also the future by making use of the past prices. In simple words, it gives investors have a better picture of what they are going to make on their investments should they invest in a particular digital currency.

How to calculate a moving average for cryptocurrencies?

The method is fairly simple. It's the application that's more important. For example, if you want to calculate the five-day moving average for Dogecoin, this is how you do it:

The closing prices of Dogecoin in the last five days, let's say, were 10, 13, 14, 11, and 12, respectively. Now, add the prices for the last five days and divide the total by 5.

10+13+14+11+12 = 60/5. The answer is 12, which is the moving average of Dogecoin relative to the last five days.

Dogecoin price in India stood at Rs. 22.7 as of 3:30pm IST on September 3.

Importance of moving average in cryptocurrency investments

Experts say that when the prices of a stock are below a moving average, it's an indication to traders of a bearish trend, which means both price and sentiments are trending down. On the contrary, if the prices are above the moving average, it's a sign of a bullish trend. However, other indicators, including the relative strength index, should also back the moving averages.

Among other important functions, a moving average can also help gauge the momentum, which basically measures the rise or fall in the prices of a cryptocurrency. With the help of a moving average, one can attempt to forecast, if not accurately pick and predict, the trajectory of a cryptocurrency in the days to come. This helps an investor better decide if they are making a safe and sound investment.

As we explained before, the greater the number of days the bigger is the lag. The traders actually use these figures based on the number of days to decide on whether or not they should invest in a digital asset or a cryptocurrency token.

The other advantage, of course, for traders in terms of calculating a moving average is that they can customise the time period to check the average prices according to their own needs. Moving average for a smaller period is naturally more price-sensitive compared to an average calculated for a longer period of time.

Remember, the moving average is only an indication of the trend and not a tool that sets the trend. You only get a picture of how a cryptocurrency token has performed relative to the number of days you pick to find the moving average. Cryptocurrency is deemed to be a relatively riskier asset class and the golden rule, as experts say, is to not invest more than you can afford to lose.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_goldbg_pixabay_1629281868518.png',)",none
2021-09-04,The Financial Express,Cryptocurrency: What is coin burning and why it should be a part of every investor’s calculus?,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/cryptocurrency-what-is-coin-burning-and-why-it-should-be-a-part-of-every-investors-calculus/2323339/,"Representative image

If you are new to cryptocurrencies, you must have been amused hearing about coin burn; wondering why someone needs to burn the coins? Well, let us explain.

Coin burn is a process where the miners and developers remove the coins from circulation. In other words, coin burn is a process of destroying the coin so that it is not available for further use (trading or otherwise). The developers and miners will send the coins to the specialised addresses whose private keys are not accessible. Further, they should provide the proof-of-burn algorithm to the market to facilitate cross verification.

Krishna Prasad, Associate Professor of Finance, T A Pai Management Institute, explained this with an example: Imagine a person having 10 notes of Rs. 2,000 and he/she decides to burn (literally) 5 notes. Once 5 notes are burnt, these notes cannot be used/accessed by anyone including the issuer. As cryptocurrencies are virtual and cannot be literally burnt, the miners/developers use digital means to make the coin unusable.

Coin burn is basically done to create a supply crunch, thereby creating an artificial upward pull for the token price.

Abhay Chebbi, Pro-Chancellor, Alliance University, said that in the real world, coin burn would amount to making a pile of currency coins or notes, and lighting a pyre to the pile. Coin burn in the cryptocurrency world is exactly the same albeit it is the burning of the cryptocurrency virtually. Each cryptocurrency network defines a protocol for accomplishing the burn but it amounts to associating the coins in circulation with unobtainable private keys so nobody can claim them to be theirs. Additionally, the event of a Coin burn itself is recorded in the ledger books so the burn is foolproof.

New Fad?

According to Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex, coin burning is not a new concept. However, this has gained a lot of attention lately following the recent London Hard Fork upgrade to the Ethereum network. With this upgrade, around 3.17 ETH is being burned every minute. To put this into perspective, the average price of ETH over the past seven days was $3200. It means that more than half a million dollars worth of ETH is being burned every hour! Such news manages to grab eyeballs faster.

Why crypto creators burn their coin

Prof. Chebbi said crypto creators burn the coins in an attempt to increase the value of the coins that remain in circulation. It is not very dissimilar to what happens in the realm of Oil. “If the price of a barrel of crude oil drops because there is a glut in the supply and the demand is not commensurately high, then the oil-producing nations reduce the supply so the prices go back up again. The same dynamic of supply and demand is at play behind the process of coin burning,” he told FE Online.

Explaining further, Prof. Prasad said the regular currency (INR, USD, GBP etc.) is issued and controlled by the respective governments through the central banks. If the country issues excess currency it will lead to inflation (hyperinflation) as the supply of money is greater than the demand. On the other hand, if the country issues less currency it might lead to depression or contraction of the economy. Similarly, the excess supply of coins might result in inflation. As these coins are not issued or controlled by any single authority, the developers/miners burn the coins.

Almost all cryptocurrency networks have defined the protocols and mechanisms for coin burn. “Proof-of-burn” has become as integral a part of crypto talk as “proof-of-work” (which gives rise to coins being mined).

It is not necessary that all cryptocurrencies need to be burned. Only those with excess supply undergo this process.

Main Objective

“The primary objective of coin burn is to regulate the supply and thereby stabilize the price. The process is similar to demonetisation of currency or buy-back of shares. On June 25th Infosys Ltd. announced the buy-back 1.084 million shares. The objective here was to reduce the supply of Infosys shares traded in the stock markets. The earnings per share (EPS) of Infosys after the buy-back will increase which will in turn increase the share price. Similarly, when the inflation in country rises due to excess money supply, the central bank increases the interest rates. The person with excess cash will then deposit the money in bank, thereby, reducing the liquidity. This example is not exactly same as the burn process, however, achieves the same objective,” said Prof. Prasad.

When the developers/miners burn the coins, the number of coins available in the digital currency market reduces. As a result, the price of the coin will increase (at least theoretically it should).

Prof. Chebbi said a fundamental difference between the fiat currency and cryptocurrency is, fiat currency is inflationary in nature while cryptocurrency is deflationary. The reason for this is, the total amount of fiat money in circulation keeps increasing with time (through the instrument of debt, and printing of money by the Central banks). But, the total amount of cryptocurrency (for most currencies) in circulation has an upper limit — for example, in the case of Bitcoin, the target is 21 million coins. Therefore, the value of a unit of fiat money loses value over time (because of inflation), and in the case of crypto money when mining can no longer unearth new coins, a unit of crypto money will keep accumulating value (deflation). Even so, till such a saturation point is reached, the crypto promoters reckon the Coin burn is a good way to boost the value of cryptocurrencies.

Coin burn impact on market

Prof. Prasad said the outcome of coin burn is not yet been proved (as it is a recent phenomenon). However, theoretically the burn process should stabilise the prices/markets.

Prof. Chebbi also said that the jury is still out there on the impact of the burn process on the cryptocurrency market. In the immediate aftermath of Bitcoin’s last Coin burn, it did gain value. On the other hand, burning of BNB tokens didn’t fetch any appreciable dividends for that currency. “We think that the long-term stability and viability of a cryptocurrency market is driven more by the strength of that currency itself (such as the confidence of the investors in it and eventually its acceptance by the world as a medium of exchange). However, Coin burn does have a place in propping up the currency and for demonstrating the promoters’ commitment to the currency,” he said.

“The same way that different fiat currencies — the U.S. Dollar, Indian Rupee, the U.K. pound etc have their innate strengths, different cryptocurrencies be it Bitcoin, BNB tokens, or Ethereum have their own strengths. The impact of the Central banks’ policies (quantitative easing or tightening of money supply et al) on the stability of different currencies is not uniform. Extrapolating that to cryptocurrencies, we find that different currencies respond to Coin burn in their own distinct ways,” Prof Chebbi added.

Coin burn impact on investors

According to Prof Prasad, the coin burn process is very important for two reasons.

– First, the investors get the tangible benefit through improved valuation.

Second, the coin burn process signals the investors that the prices will be stabilized through self-regulation in the absence of regulators.

For example, when an individual stock hits the upper or lower circuit, the stock exchange (NSE or BSE) suspends the trade to allow the prices to stabilize. But this is not possible in the case of digital currency. Hence, the coin burn instils the confidence among the investors as it serves as a mechanism to stabilise the digital currency prices.

Study coin burn before investing

Prof. Chebbi said, “Unless you are hoarding Coins of any denomination (be it Bitcoin, BNE or others), you don’t want to burn the coins you own. Currently, only the promoters (for example Binance’s BNB tokens) burn some of their holdings so the people investing in their currency realize a higher value for their investments. If you are an investor looking to invest in crypto, you should study if Coin burns have happened for that currency and if there is a defined burn schedule.”

“It should be a part of your calculus while making investment decisions. In general, if Coin burns have happened and/or scheduled, it should give you more confidence that there are people invested in seeing that currency grow, and that would be a factor in its favor,” he added.","('https://images.financialexpress.com/2021/09/coin-burn.jpg',)",none

Elon Musk hasn’t earned the name “crypto king” and “dogefather” for no reason.

His decision to type a single word into social media earlier this week has seen a flurry of activity in the cryptocurrency realm.

The billionaire entrepreneur replied to a tweet on Monday about an update to the dogecoin network and it sent prices surging.

Mr Musk wrote a single word: “Important.”

But it soon acquired more likes than the original tweet and saw a temporary rise in the cryptocurrency.

According to the tweet that the Tesla CEO brought attention to, only 205 computers were already running doge’s newest update.

However, once more computers run the upgrade, the network will be more “secure” and will “lower the transaction fees”.

Within 24 hours of the tweet, dogecoin rose by 1.52 per cent to US $0.2734 (A$0.37).

By Friday, it was up to US$0.2911 (A$0.39) at time of writing.

The phenomenon of the tech tycoon’s tweets buoying the market has been called the “Musk effect” by some.

In May, a tweet by Mr Musk was credited for a rise of more than 29 per cent in one particular cryptocurrency.

Then a month later, Mr Musk caused a 10 per cent rise in an altcoin called shiba inu.

When Musk tweeted, “My shiba inu will be named Floki,” in June, shiba inu coin’s price spiked about 10 per cent.

Musk is a huge believer in dogecoin.

A few months ago, he said dogecoin could easily “become the currency of Earth” and beat other cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, “hands down”.

Bitcoin is soon going to update its system with the taproot update in November.

Dogecoin was first created in 2013 as a joke payment system, but many, including Musk, believe it will make lots of money in the future.

Musk has previously said that anything he says about doge should not be taken seriously.

Bitcoin is currently the leader the cryptocurrency industry, with a single coin selling for US$48,482 (A$65,530) at time of writing.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ccde63d73c49b25626744774f0983cf8',)",none
2021-09-04,News18,Crypto as Commodity: Government to Issue New Cryptocurrency Bill. Know the Details,https://www.news18.com/news/business/crypto-as-commodity-government-to-issue-new-cryptocurrency-bill-know-the-details-4161032.html,"Cryptocurrencies are potentially looking at a new change in India as the government is planning on ‘defining’ it as per a report by Economic Times. It was suggested that the government of India was proposing a new bill to segment cryptocurrencies on use cases sources informed ET. This would be a first for cryptocurrencies as they have never been categorized by the technology used. However, the government’s focus, for the time being, is on the end-use of the asset for regulatory purposes the report mentioned.

This new bill is expected to outline the tax treatment of these digital assets and will define how they are classified in the book. It remained ambiguous as to whether the cryptocurrencies were considered currencies, commodities services or more equitable said the report. It eventually comes down to a matter of law, as the main concern with the ambiguity is in regards to how the asset is taxed or regulated. Till now, that has not been the case with cryptocurrency in India.

The first goal of the government in this matter is then to define the cryptocurrency sources told ET. It was also suggested that India should recognize crypto tokens as digital assets as opposed to a currency, while simultaneously clarifying the policies on exchange ownership parameters, KYC, accounting and reporting standards and so on, said the report.

It was also reported that only the cryptocurrency assets that were classified and defined by the government would be allowed to trade in India. The crypto coins would then be taxed accordingly. It was suggested that the government might apply a tax similar to the Security Transaction Tax (STT) going forward. In another line, these digital assets could also be subject to income tax if they are indeed classified as commodities. The income could be taxed as business income in the hands of the investors at the normal rates of income tax.

In the past the Reserve Bank of India had flagged the issue of cryptocurrency as it was not regulated nor did it have any prior framework in place. Having said that, this move by the government could be seen as a morale boost for Indian cryptocurrency investors. It could also see a rise in the spread of knowledge of the previously mysterious digital asset and could promote better investment opportunities.

While this does capture the attention of the industry experts, investors and crypto exchanges alike, one would have to wait and see what the new bill spells for crypto going forward in the country.

The global crypto market had seen some major fluctuations over the past few months. At present, the global market cap stood at $2.26 trillion, which was a 1.15 per cent increase over the day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours was $131.49 billion, which pointed to a 2.52 per cent increase.

Bitcoin which is the leading crypto coin had a price of $49,927.54 on Friday. It maintained a market dominance of 41.51 per cent, although it did see a drop of 0.63 per cent over the course of the day. Other popular coins in the market include Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin and Tether.

Micro-blogging platform Twitter may be developing ways for users to accept payments inand, a mobile developer from Italy, tweeted screenshots that suggest that Twitter will allow users to add their Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses to their profiles soon.The feature seems to be part of Twitter’s recently announced Tip Jar function, which allows users to ‘tip’ influencers for their content — not to be confused with Super Follows , which allow influencers to provide premium content to paid subscribers. It’s unclear whether Twitter will eventually allow cryptocurrencies for subscribing through Super Follows as well.While Paluzzi does have a track record of dependable leaks, this particular tidbit comes with added support. His tweet was retweeted by Kavyon Beykpour, who leads product for Twitter. Beykpour simply put a lightning emoji on the retweet, which may not be a confirmation, but is probably as close as we’ll get to Twitter confirming a feature like this ahead of time.It’s also worth noting that this isn’t the first time Twitter has been said to be working on adding cryptos to its platform. A report from MacRumours last month also said that Twitter’s beta users have seen tutorials about Bitcoin on Tip Jar in that version. “Details in the latest Twitter beta indicate that users will be directed through a Bitcoin tutorial that includes details on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and custodial and non-custodial Bitcoin wallets,” the report said.More importantly, Twitter’s chief executive officer and founder, Jack Dorsey is a known supporter of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. In the company’s July earnings call this year, Dorsey had told investors that Bitcoin will be a “big part” of Twitter’s future. Of course, he didn’t provide any details of how the cryptocurrency will be included, but that’s at least a confirmation that Twitter isn’t opposed to working alongside crypto tokens.Dorsey is no stranger to cryptocurrencies either. His payments company, Square, has already talked about adding Bitcoin to its platform. Dorsey himself has also talked about building a decentralized exchange for cryptocurrencies. In February this year, Dorsey and rapper Jay-Z had invested 500 Bitcoins, worth over $23 million at the time, to fund Bitcoin development in countries like Africa and India.

2021-09-04,NDTV Gadgets 360,"Bitcoin Adoption in El Salvador: Majority of People Don’t Want the Cryptocurrency, Poll Shows",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-adoption-el-salvador-date-majority-dont-want-president-nayib-bukele-poll-2528433,"Most Salvadorans disagree with the government's decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, with many unaware of how to use the digital currency and distrustful of the project, a poll by the Central American University (UCA) showed on Thursday.

At least 67.9 percent of 1,281 people surveyed said they disagree or strongly disagree with the use of Bitcoin as a legal tender, said the poll by UCA, a Jesuit university based in El Salvador. Just over 32 percent of people said they agree on some level.

The study was issued days before the government is due to formalise the cryptocurrency as legal tender in El Salvador on September 7, a plan announced by President Nayib Bukele in June.

UCA's poll, carried out in August, also showed that 9 out of 10 people did not have a clear understanding of Bitcoin, and 8 out of 10 said they had little or no confidence in its use. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 37.8 lakhs as of 1pm IST on September 3.

Most people, 7 out of 10, thought lawmakers should repeal the law that makes it legal tender.

""What we can see in this survey, in addition to this broad rejection of the implementation of Bitcoin as legal tender, is that for the first time we found a significant disagreement between the population and decisions being made by the Legislative Assembly and the president,"" said UCA dean Andreu Oliva.

The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the poll. Bukele and his government have presented the measure as a way to boost jobs and economic development by making El Salvador less reliant on US dollars, the current legal tender.

The survey also showed most Salvadorans think the main beneficiaries will be the wealthy, foreign investors, the government, and business leaders.

""There is a lot of concern about the possible negative effects of using Bitcoin,"" said Oliva.

2021-09-04,NDTV Gadgets 360,Pirate Bay May Have Amassed $6 Million in Bitcoin Donations Since 2013: Report,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/pirate-bay-torrent-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-price-usd-6-million-donations-2013-2528320,"The Pirate Bay appears to be among those who embraced cryptocurrency quickly and gained from the late but rapid surge in its craze. Several torrent sites added an option to let their users donate via Bitcoin in 2013, as per a report. And The Pirate Bay, too, reportedly received a steady stream of donations in Bitcoin over the years. It was one of the first to get on board and it is reported to have got BTC 5.56 on the very first day it started receiving donations in cryptocurrency. The amount reached up to $10 (roughly Rs. 730) per day and it is likely that the website now has more than $6 million (roughly Rs. 40 crores) in Bitcoin.

When The Pirate Bay started receiving donations in 2013, one Bitcoin was worth $125 (roughly Rs. 9,100). So the site earned nearly $700 (roughly Rs. 51,100) in just 24 hours. Basing it on today's exchange rate, the $125 valuation of Bitcoin from 2013 has grown to nearly $50,000 at the time of writing. This means that the BTC 5.56 that came in on the first day back in 2013 is worth nearly $278,000 (roughly Rs. 2 crores) today. Had The Pirate Bay been holding Bitcoin since then, it should be sitting on a massive pile of Bitcoin today. According to a report by TorrentFreak, that amount could be as high as $6 million.

As of September 3 (12:20pm IST), Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 37.86 lakhs.

When The Pirate Bay users began supporting it via cryptocurrency donation, copyright owners and trade bodies told US authorities that this would complicate cracking down on them, as per the report. Websites like The Pirate Bay reportedly faced heightened scrutiny from law enforcement and remain a target of companies, copyright owners, and regulators from all around the world.

Based on a quick calculation, TorrentFreak concluded that The Pirate Bay has earned about BTC 135 in donations over the years. However, it added that its calculation isn't exhaustive or perfect.

Gradually, as the Bitcoin donations started to dry, The Pirate Bay added Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash as options but that reportedly did not make any difference. Last month, the Bitcoin Cash option was swapped for Ethereum.

2021-09-04,Analytics Insight,Top10 Most Purchased Cryptocurrencies in September 2021,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top10-most-purchased-cryptocurrencies-in-september-2021/,"Top10 Most Purchased Cryptocurrencies in September 2021

These cryptocurrencies have the highest 24-hour volumes in September so far.

The popularity of cryptocurrencies is increasing at a rapid pace and this influence is attracting new investors along with seasoned financial investors who want to give cryptocurrencies a shot. With several headlines every day, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are spreading the needed awareness of crypto potential. If you want to invest in cryptocurrencies or expand your already existing crypto portfolio, here are the most bought cryptocurrencies in September so far.

1. Tether

Tether is a stable coin. Unlike most other cryptocurrencies, its value is pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or the Euro. Tether ensures that its investors receive a value of US$1 or 1 Euro for every Tether purchased. For investors who are looking for low-risk options, stable coins like Tether are a good choice as there is almost no volatility effect.

2. Bitcoin

The king of all cryptocurrencies is all about growth these days. Coasting through the highs and lows, Bitcoin is now nearing its all-time high of US$60,000. This growth spurt is exciting several investors into reaping profits as Bitcoin is taking the cryptocurrency market towards a bull run.

3. Ethereum

The second-largest cryptocurrency in the market, Ethereum is known for its decentralized software platform that first introduced smart contracts. With a market cap of US$445 billion, Ethereum’s anticipated new launch, Ethereum 2.0, has made this cryptocurrency one of the most widely talked about projects in the crypto world. Many tech giants, including Microsoft, Intel, and JP Morgan are building software for business use that runs on the Ethereum network.

4. Binance Coin

As long as there is activity on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, its token Binance Coin will continue to grow. Binance Coin acts as a payment method for anyone who wants to trade on Binance exchange. Even after the recent shut down by the UK, Binance continues to lead the market so Binance Coin’s value is intact. As of 2021, it has a market cap of US$81 billion, making it the fourth-largest crypto in the world.

5. Ethereum Classic

Ethereum Classic is a result of a split in Ethereum’s network. It is an open-source, decentralized crypto platform that also runs smart contracts. While this is being considered as a new cryptocurrency, its 24-hour market volume is US$5.70 billion with a market cap of US$8.77 billion already.

6. XRP

Ripple is a digital technology and payments processing company and XRP is it’s token. To facilitate the exchange of other cryptocurrencies on the network, XRP can be traded for traditional currencies as well. XRP has seen massive growth over the years and now trades at US$1.2 making this one of the most affordable cryptos to invest in that is trusted by several banks.

7. Cardano

Cardano is an underrated cryptocurrency. It’s the biggest competitor to Ethereum as Cardano uses a proof-of-stake algorithm, something that Ethereum will soon incorporate. While Cardano has yet to release smart contracts, its network is faster and cheaper than Ethereum. Amidst the market volatility, Cardano has the trend to stabilize quickly. It’s the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the world and a reliable choice for investors.

8. Solana

Solana is one of the fastest-growing DeFi ecosystems and now has a native cryptocurrency coin that saw its value peak in July. Launched in March 2020, within a short span it has managed to become the 14th largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of US$37 billion. The Proof-of-History algorithm that it uses has the highest speeds of transaction. As compared to Ether, Solana offers low transaction fees.

9. USD Coin

USD Coin is also a stable coin with its value pegged to the US dollar. For every USD Coin bought, the investor will be assured the value of US$1. This coin is powered by Ethereum which means it can complete transactions on a global scale.

10. Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash has a historic factor behind its success. It is one of the earliest and most successful hard forks of the original Bitcoin. A fork, in the crypto world, refers to a separate coin that is stemmed out of debates between developers and miners. Bitcoin failed to fulfill all the promises it made about its blockchain network, and hence Bitcoin Cash was born. With no other connection to Bitcoin, BTC holds immense potential because of its faster network and as it is cheaper than Bitcoin, investors trust its future to invest in Bitcoin Cash.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-10-Most-Purchased-Cryptocurrencies-in-September-2021.jpg',)",none
2021-09-04,NDTV.com,What Factors Determine The Value Of Cryptocurrency? Find Out,https://www.ndtv.com/business/how-is-the-value-of-cryptocurrency-determined-2520929,"As usability of a coin increases, its demand rises, which, in turn, increases the coin's value

Cryptocurrency is the new craze for retailers and investors. But one factor about digital currencies always worries investors — volatility. Cryptocurrencies have witnessed massive hikes and drops in value, and that can push any diligent crypto fan into deep thought. But what exactly impacts the value of cryptocurrencies? What are the factors that affect the values? Let us discuss points that we need to keep in mind before investing in a cryptocurrency.

Demand

Cryptocurrency, though not tactile and visible like fiat currency, is quite similar in usage. Both the currencies draw their importance in society from their acceptance and usage among people as an exchange medium. That brings us to the first factor that determines cryptocurrency's value —demand. As the usability of a coin increases, its demand rises, which, in turn, increases the coin's value. This has been one of the important reasons why major cryptocurrencies have appreciated in value in the last few years.

Node count

This refers to a number of active wallets with respect to a cryptocurrency that can be found on the internet or the homepage of the currency. This is also a factor to determine whether a coin can overcome market crises.

Production cost

Of course, there are production costs incurred when mining crypto coins. The direct costs and the costs of resources that have gone into the mining of the coin determine its value. Higher the production costs, the higher the coin's value.

Mass adoption

This follows from the first point. The greater the number of takers, the greater will be the value of a crypto coin. That's because, unlike fiat currency, which is produced by national mints in huge numbers, crypto coins are generated in very limited amounts. This is an important factor to help determine cryptocurrency value.

Blockchain

Prudent investors weigh the security as well as future prospects provided by blockchains to zero in on a particular cryptocurrency. Beginners may go for the ones that provide maximum security to their coins. However, professional investors look for the future potential of blockchain technologies.

Market regulation

Market regulation by professional crypto traders can also affect the value trends of a coin. This is known as the work of “whales” in the crypto world. This cluster of investors often causes a rise or drop in the value of coins.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/49nrvmng_dogecoin-cryptocurrency-doge_625x300_31_August_21.jpg',)",none

Curtis Sliwa, a candidate for New York City (NYC) mayor, said that he will make his city “the most cryptocurrency-friendly city” in the U.S. if he is elected. He joins a growing list of mayors and mayoral candidates in growing cryptocurrency adoption.

Mayoral Candidate Plans to Turn NYC Into the Most Crypto-Friendly City

NYC mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa has shared his vision to make New York City the most cryptocurrency-friendly place in the U.S. Sliwa, a radio talk show host, is the founder and chief executive officer of the Guardian Angels, a nonprofit organization of unarmed crime prevention.

He tweeted Wednesday: “As NYC Mayor, I will make NYC the most cryptocurrency-friendly city in the nation. Property taxes, fines & fees will be payable in crypto. We will open more crypto ATMs & incentivize businesses to accept crypto. We must modernize our economy & make it accessible for all!”

Sliwa is not the only mayoral candidate for NYC who wants to see the city becoming a crypto hub.

Brooklyn Borough President and former police officer Eric Adams, who is also currently running for mayor of NYC, promised in June that in one year New York will be “the center of all technology,” including “the center of bitcoins.” While Adams won the Democratic mayoral primary and Silwa prevailed in the Republican mayoral primary.

Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang was also running for mayor of New York City when he promised that as mayor he would invest in making the city “a hub for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.” Yang is also pro-universal basic income (UBI) and wants to launch “the largest basic income program in history.”

A few other mayors in U.S. cities have made efforts to boost the adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The mayor of the U.S. city of Jackson, Tennessee, recently said that the price of BTC will keep rising as the Fed continues to print money. He believes that bitcoin is “definitely the future monetary system.”

The mayor of Miami, Florida, has been working to get his city to allow payments in BTC and possibly keeping some bitcoin in its treasury. Meanwhile, the mayor of Cool Valley, Missouri, is raising funds in order to give bitcoin to all residents in his city.

Do you think NYC will become the most crypto-friendly city? Let us know in the comments section below.

2021-09-03,KTLA,L.A. cryptocurrency promoter pleads guilty in $2 billion ‘textbook Ponzi scheme’,https://ktla.com/news/local-news/l-a-cryptocurrency-promoter-pleads-guilty-in-2-billion-textbook-ponzi-scheme/,"A Los Angeles man pleaded guilty Wednesday to participating in what prosecutors called a “textbook Ponzi scheme” that defrauded cryptocurrency investors worldwide of more than $2 billion.

Prosecutors said Glenn Arcaro, 44, sat atop the North American branch of the pyramid investment scheme BitConnect, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

Arcaro, who pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, admitted in his plea agreement to earning “no less than $24 million from the BitConnect fraud conspiracy,” the newspaper said.

As part of his plea, Arcaro must pay back that money to investors. He faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced Nov. 15.

“The BitConnect scheme is believed to be the largest cryptocurrency fraud ever charged criminally,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a statement.

Arcaro’s plea came the same day that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against BitConnect, the Union-Tribune said.

According to prosecutors, Arcaro and his co-conspirators claimed that BitConnect used a proprietary technology that was able to generate huge profits by using investors’ money to trade on the volatility of cryptocurrency exchange markets.

“In truth, BitConnect operated a textbook Ponzi scheme by paying earlier BitConnect investors with money from later investors,” prosecutors said.","('https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/09/GettyImages-1234060854.jpg?w=1280',)",none

So, before talking about how the regulations should work, the government has to spell out what it means by cryptocurrencies,” said a person aware of the development.ET had recently reported that crypto exchanges had made policy recommendations for regulating cryptocurrencies, including defining cryptocurrencies as digital assets and introducing a system to register home-grown exchanges.They had suggested that India needs to recognise crypto tokens as digital assets, rather than currencies, and clarify policies in regards to exchange ownership parameters, KYC, accounting and reporting standards, among others.“There are more than 5,000 different cryptocurrencies, each with its own different legal characteristics. Therefore, rather than the cryptocurrency technology alone, regulation should be tailored according to the end-use or activity of a particular token,” said Jaideep Reddy, leader - technology law at law firm Nishith Desai Associates.People in the know said only the cryptocurrencies that are covered under the government’s definition will be allowed to be traded in India.These crypto assets will then be taxed accordingly, said people aware of the development.The government could apply something similar to security transaction tax (STT) on the trading of cryptocurrencies as well, sources said.Apart from that, if crypto assets are categorised as commodities, the returns could be taxed as business income in the hands of the investors on the returns at normal income tax rates.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had flagged off issues around cryptocurrencies in the past.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85885660,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-215096,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg',)",none

Charles Hoskinson Sees Cryptocurrencies Playing Larger Role in Afghanistan

Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, explained in an interview with CNBC Tuesday that cryptocurrencies are likely to play a larger role in Afghanistan, citing a rising need for more privacy.

The Cardano founder believes that there will be ongoing civil war in the country and “already the remnants of the northern alliance have been formed, and they’re going to need resources.” He noted that “Unlike the last time, in the 90’s when this happened, now cryptocurrencies are there,” elaborating:

It is my belief that cryptocurrencies are going to play a larger role in Afghanistan this time around, in the war for and against the Taliban forces.

The Pentagon said Monday that the U.S. finished its withdrawal efforts from the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, effectively ending a 20-year conflict that began soon after the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001. However, there are some U.S. citizens and Afghans in the country who wanted to leave Afghanistan but were unable to do so.

Hoskinson described:

It’s going to be really interesting to see how that gets integrated into statecraft and how that gets integrated into resistance against a regime that clearly doesn’t care for the rights of many people and clearly wants to put in a theocracy that belongs more in the 13th century than the 21st century.

Cryptocurrency and bitcoin adoption have been growing in Afghanistan particularly during the recent cash shortage.

The 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index, compiled by blockchain data platform Chainalysis, shows that Afghanistan ranks 20th out of 154 countries. In comparison, the U.S. ranks 8th on the index. The top-ranking country for crypto adoption is Vietnam, followed by India and Pakistan.

Prosecutors said Glenn Arcaro, 44, sat atop the North American branch of the pyramid investment scheme BitConnect, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

Arcaro, who pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, admitted in his plea agreement to earning “no less than $24 million from the BitConnect fraud conspiracy,"" the newspaper said.

As part of his plea, Arcaro must pay back that money to investors. He faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced Nov. 15.

Arcaro’s plea came the same day that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against BitConnect, the Union-Tribune said.

According to prosecutors, Arcaro and his co-conspirators claimed that BitConnect used a proprietary technology that was able to generate huge profits by using investors’ money to trade on the volatility of cryptocurrency exchange markets.

“In truth, BitConnect operated a textbook Ponzi scheme by paying earlier BitConnect investors with money from later investors,” prosecutors said.","('https://www.newsobserver.com/wps/build/images/newsobserver/facebook.jpg',)",none
2021-09-03,Cointelegraph,Cryptocurrencies now recognized under commercial law in Texas,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrencies-now-legally-recognized-under-commercial-law-in-texas,"Two bills aimed at furthering the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain are now law in the state of Texas.

Texas House Bills 4474 and 1576, passed by both chambers in the state legislature in May and signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott in June, officially took effect on Sept. 1. H.B. 1576 establishes a blockchain working group in Texas, while H.B. 4474 amends the state's Uniform Commercial Code to recognize cryptocurrencies under commercial law.

Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, told Cointelegraph that H.B. 4474 better defines the security interests for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies to ""allow institutional investors to get involved with sizable investments."" He added that the Texas Banking Commissioner and the Texas Department of Banking announced in June that banks with a state charter can custody cryptocurrencies under certain circumstances.

""This is positive for crypto generally because Texas became the 4th U.S. state, behind Wyoming, Rhode Island and Nebraska, to clarify the commercial law status of these assets,"" Wyoming-based crypto proponent Caitlin Long told Cointelegraph. ""This means parties to transactions have clarity regarding their legal rights and obligations, judges have a roadmap to adjudicate disputes, and lenders know they have an enforceable lien on the crypto pledged as collateral for collateralized loans.""

The Texas Blockchain Council president told Cointelegraph in March that Texas adapting commercial law to blockchain innovation and digital asset regulations could bring the state more in line with Wyoming, which has a Digital Asset Law which went into effect in July 2019. Governor Abbott has also previously described himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” — specifically referencing H.B. 4474 — and seemed to encourage crypto mining firms to operate in Texas.

2021-09-03,NDTV Gadgets 360,Former US President Donald Trump Says Cryptocurrency is a ‘Disaster Waiting to Happen’,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-disaster-fake-donald-trump-former-us-president-dogecoin-price-naomi-osaka-2527274,"Former US President Donald Trump is “not a big fan” of cryptocurrency. Trump has been vocal about his dislike for digital currency several times. On Tuesday, he told Fox Business that investing in crypto could be “potentially a disaster waiting to happen”. In an exclusive interview on the show Varney & Co., Trump was asked by host Stuart Varney, “Do you have a dabble in Bitcoin or cryptos?” Trump noted that he does not invest in Bitcoin or other digital currencies. “I like the currency of the United States,” he said.

Trump did not budge from his point and added, “I feel that it (cryptocurrency) hurts the United States currency.” Instead of supporting the digital currency, Trump kept his faith in the US dollar. He said, “I think we should be invested in our currency.”

His attack continued when he said that cryptocurrencies “may be fake”. He added, “Who knows what they are? But they certainly are something that people don't know very much about.”

Even earlier, Trump had expressed his dislike for towards cryptocurrency. Once, he had called it a “scam” and alleged that it was taking “the edge off of the dollar and the importance of the dollar”.

Trump's statements come at a time when cryptocurrency still remains unregulated under US legislation. However, Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler looks like he's in favour of cryptocurrencies. He believes that the “field is not going to reach any of its potential if it tries to stay outside of our laws”.

Gensler also called cryptocurrency “innovative technologies” while also being aware of the risks in the industry.

Over the years, cryptocurrencies have had mixed responses from people. While they have received a lot of support from the likes of Elon Musk, there have been others like Trump who have slammed the digital assets. A few days ago, billionaire John Paulson had called cryptocurrencies a “worthless” bubble. He said that no matter where cryptocurrencies are trading now, eventually they will go to zero, once the exuberance wears off.

However, on the other hand, looks like defending US Open champion Naomi Osaka, has taken a keen interest in Dogecoin, which was spurred by all the noise around the meme-based cryptocurrency. In an interview a few days ago, Osaka said that she's even had discussions with her agent about cryptocurrencies and that she had read about Dogecoin as well. Dogecoin price in India was around Rs. 23 at 7pm on September 2.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/trump_reuters_1610080649024.jpg',)",none

This past weekend at the Market America Worldwide Shop.com 2021 International Convention (MAIC2021), the president of the e-commerce firm, Steve Ashley, announced Shop.com sites from around the world will be accepting cryptocurrencies via Bitpay. This means that bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, and several other digital assets can be used to purchase products via Shop.com’s websites.

Shop.com Now Accepts Digital Currencies via Bitpay

Shop.com is accepting cryptocurrencies via Bitpay, the largest crypto payment service provider in the world. Steve Ashley the president and COO of Shop.com announced “the use of cryptocurrency as the next chapter in purchasing products on all Shop.com sites.” Ashley revealed the crypto support at the Market America Worldwide Shop.com 2021 International Convention (MAIC2021).

“Today I’m announcing that Shop.com is going to be offering bitcoin, ethereum, and several other cryptocurrencies through Bitpay,” said Ashley. “We’re going to be offering this at Shop.com sites worldwide in all of our Market Countries,” Ashley added.

Shop.com is a fairly popular e-commerce web portal that’s ranked 26,133 worldwide and 191 against “E-commerce and shopping” websites, according to similarweb.com statistics. Shop.com is owned by Market America, a multi-level marketing (MLM) firm that was created in 1992. Market America purchased Shop.com for an undisclosed sum at the end of 2010. Market America also specializes in manufacturing a line of Isotonix it introduced to the public the year after the company started.

“Shop.com and Market America are such great brands,” Sonny Singh, Bitpay’s chief commercial officer said in a statement sent to Bitcoin.com News. “What I really like about them as such a great fit is because of your international presence. The fact that you’re only doing 40% of your volume in America means it’s a really global brand,” Singh added. The Bitpay chief commercial officer continued:

In countries like Taiwan, Thailand, Argentina, Brazil, and Indonesia, it’s very hard to make payments. Credit cards are not everywhere and in those countries, Bitpay and crypto is the cheapest, quickest payment option to accept Bitcoin and to receive crypto payment options as well.

JR Ridinger, the founder and CEO of Market America, said that Shop.com, thanks to Steve Ashley’s leadership, continues to be a trendsetter. “As different online retailers scramble to create a plan of action to implement things like accepting cryptocurrency as a method of online payment, thanks to Steve Ashley – we’ve already done that,” Ridinger said.

When visiting the Shop.com website, the web portal displays a newly added message about the crypto acceptance. The message leads to a page that describes how Shop.com customers can leverage the Bitpay crypto payment system to pay for items. The website also details that Shop.com customers can “earn cashback on thousands of products with Bitpay.”

NEW DELHI: Will cryptocurrencies wreck the global warming targets and trigger an environmental disaster? This question has become the topic of heated debates between cryptocurrency advocates and those who want them banned.The first generation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 consume ginormous amounts of electricity when they are mined. Mining is the process by which new Bitcoins enter circulation and the ledger of transactions is maintained and validated.It requires sophisticated and powerful computers to solve cryptographic puzzles and has been built around the “proof of work” principle.Mining has been getting progressively more difficult and expensive over time because of the way the first crypto currency, Bitcoin, and the others that followed initially, were created.But how much energy does cryptocurrency mining actually consume? Estimates vary. The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF) had estimated that currently Bitcoin mining consumes around 110 Terawatt Hours per year.Others have put it even higher – at around 155 TWh or so. To put that in perspective, it is around 0.55 percent of global electricity production, or equal to what a country like Malaysia consumes annually.And that is just for Bitcoin mining. Add the others and you are looking at an even higher energy footprint.Critics point out that the CO2 and heat generated by crypto currency mining is far more than any gains that one gets from emission reductions of electric vehicles (EV) being used around the world.Bitcoin mining and that of other similar cryptocurrencies were particularly bad for the environment until even a couple of years ago because the miners primarily used power from plants using coal.Many of the crypto currency mining hubs were in China, and while some of them used the cleaner hydro power, a number of miners depended on thermal power plants too. At one point, over 60 percent of Bitcoin mining was taking place in China.But over the past year, China has cracked down on miners and most miners have started moving out. Also, increasingly miners have been relying on green and renewable energy rather than thermal power.Most miners are working in areas where energy is generated using solar, wind, hydro and even flared natural gas of oil wells. While these do not cut out emissions altogether, there has been a concerted effort by the crypto currency champions to utilise energy that is both cheap and has a lower carbon footprint.Meanwhile, newer crypto currencies are ensuring that they either use less power for mining or use a different method of validation called “proof of stake”, which does not require using the kind of power that proof of work crypto currencies require.Even Ethereum, the second oldest and second most popular crypto currency is coming out with version 2.0, which will drastically cut down its carbon footprint.The worry for cryptocurrency miners is that increasingly, countries will regulate mining or ban it altogether in order to meet the emission goals agreed upon. This is why the search of solutions is going on frenetically.Multiple suggestions ranging from introducing a new cryptocurrency that will be given to anyone who can submit proof of removing each ton of CO2 or other greenhouse gases to the development of new eco-friendly crypto currencies to a blockchain-based platform to track carbon emissions and reduction of crypto currency usage.One solution – the Crypto Climate Accord -- envisages a pact that will see the shifting of all crypto currency activities to clean fuels and become net zero carbon emission by 2040. The problem is that while it has supporters, many of the older and more popular cryptocurrencies have yet to sign up for it.The issue is that using green energy for cryptocurrency mining alone doesn’t solve the entire problem. Even when clean energy or renewable energy like solar is used, the sheer power needed by the computers generates enormous heat.Crypto mining also adds to the pile of electronic waste that needs to be disposed of. And the fact that cryptocurrency mining becomes more difficult and requires more computing power every year creates its own set of environmental hazards.Crypto advocates suggest that eventually a solution acceptable to all will be found. Apart from transiting to green energy, crypto miners will also play a role in grid balancing and flexible demand-response services.Over the next few years, we will know whether that works out as well as they expect. Meanwhile, environmental scientists plan to keep a close watch on the crypto mining industry.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85864245,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50952,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

In the past, China’s regulatory crackdown pushed the Bitcoin to touch an all -time low and also made the cryptocurrency market volatile, so much so that Bitcoin oscillated between highs and lows. Bitcoin touched a low of $28,000 in June and high of $75,000 in April. Also, the largest currency Bitcoin’s dominance witnessed an increase of 0.08 per cent and currently stands at 42.16 per cent. On the other hand, Ethereum, the viral currency of Bitcoin, was also trading in the green at $3,742.55, up 6.48 per cent. Amongst the basket of cryptocurrency, barring Tether, USD Coin, Binance USD were trading in the red on Thursday.

“BTC remained muted over the past few days, yet most of the Altcoins made significant bullish movements. However, it was a totally different story over the past 24 hours. We witnessed massive volatility where BTC moved significantly higher. It made the already pumped-up Altcoins move even higher. The largest Altcoin, Ether, made a huge jump from the day’s low of $3384 and moved closer to the $3800 mark. Most of the other top Altcoins replicated a similar move. The crypto fear and greed index is at 71 for the past couple of weeks, indicating a massive bullish momentum prevailing in the markets. The entire crypto market capitalization moved a massive 4 per cent higher over the previous day and stood close to $2.18 trillion. Traded volumes were significantly high, indicating the buying pressure across the spectrum,” Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder, Mudrex- A Global Crypto Trading Platform, said.

In the last two weeks, favourable developments in the world of cryptocurrency led to a sharp rally in the prices of cryptocurrency. After Raghuram Rajan, former RBI governor of India’s comment regarding cryptocurrency, on Wednesday, well known tennis player Naomi Osaka showed her interest in cryptocurrency. Yesterday, she took to Twitter and said, “I was actually just talking with my agent about cryptocurrencies,” Osaka said in an interview to Bloomberg. “I know that online, everything is getting bigger. I remember reading about Dogecoin … there’s going to be something new and interesting that’s going to pop up.” On Thursday, the global crypto market cap is $2.24 trillion, which is a 5.89 per cent increase over the last day. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $129.10 billion, which makes a 0.99 per cent decrease. The total volume in DeFi is currently $15.84 billion, 12.27 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins is now $97.60 billion, which is 75.61 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.

“Bitcoin is officially on track to become a legal tender in El Salvador in the coming days. (by September 7th). Customarily, any such major update is often met with resistance. Consequently, certain volatility is expected in the coming week. For the third time in a couple of weeks, Ethereum tried to break out of a bull flag pattern on the daily charts and met with rejection at the flag’s resistance. The bulls appear to be collectively ready to breach that resistance and would only be a matter of time unless Bitcoin drags the market downhill,” Siddharth Menon, COO WazirX said.

2021-09-03,Bitcoin News,Poll: 3 Out of 4 Russian Investors Would Rather Buy Cryptocurrency Than Gold or Fiat – Bitcoin News,https://news.bitcoin.com/poll-3-out-of-4-russian-investors-would-rather-buy-cryptocurrency-than-gold-or-fiat/,"Poll: 3 Out of 4 Russian Investors Would Rather Buy Cryptocurrency Than Gold or Fiat

An overwhelming majority of Russian investors view cryptocurrencies as a more attractive investment proposition than traditional fiat currencies or gold, a new survey has established. Even among those who have never traded digital assets, most already think of buying crypto in the near future.

Crypto Is the Promising Opportunity for Russian Investors

National currencies are losing attractiveness for investors in Russia, a poll by the country’ Association of Forex Dealers (AFD) has recently found. Only a little over 14% of the respondents said they would put money into fiat while a staggering majority of 76.9% would rather buy cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Less than 9% don’t see good perspectives in any currency and have chosen gold.

Over 17% of the participants in the survey transact with digital currencies at least once a month and 35.1% trade crypto even more often than that. Another 24.7% can skip a month and less than a quarter, or 23.1%, have never performed crypto transactions.

However, 77.1% of the latter group of investors, those who have never traded digital coins, consider acquiring cryptocurrency in the near future. Another 15.3% of the polled admitted they had not yet made a final decision on the matter, and only 7.6% stated they were not going to buy crypto at all.

The poll has been conducted between Aug. 4 and 24 among 502 respondents, more than 90% of whom were males in the age range of 25 to 44 years. An impressive 76.5% of them believe that the share of digital currencies in circulation will continue to grow within the next five years and 8% expect them to replace cash completely. A study in April showed that 14% of all Russians aged 18-65 think cryptocurrency will oust fiat in a decade.

Another interesting finding in the AFD survey, quoted by Forklog, is that over half of the questioned investors, 51.5%, decided to buy digital currencies in order to increase their long-term savings while those who sought quick profits are only 8%. Respondents who intended to use coins to pay for goods and services are 22.2%. They have also admitted their plans were negatively affected by the law “On Digital Financial Assets.”

Most Russian investors who took part in the poll share an opinion that regulation is important, to weed out unscrupulous market players, for example. But at the same time, 40.4% said government control should be as limited as possible. Almost 16% believe cryptocurrencies do not require any regulations and close to 9% doubt that decentralized digital money can at all be subjected to state control in the first place.

Expanding a civil case announced in May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged BitConnect founder Satish Kumbhani, an Indian citizen, with lying about BitConnect's ability to generate profits, and violating registration laws meant to protect investors.

In a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court, the SEC also charged promoter Glenn Arcaro and his firm Future Money with fraudulently receiving more than $24 million (roughly Rs. 175 crores) in ""referral commissions"" and other sums as BitConnect's top US promoter.

Arcaro pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a related criminal wire fraud conspiracy charge before US Magistrate Judge Mitchell Dembin in San Diego. His sentencing is November 15.

The SEC lawsuit seeks to impose fines, recoup ill-gotten gains, and other relief.

Founded in 2016, BitConnect created a digital token called BitConnect Coin that could be exchanged for Bitcoin, the popular cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 37.8 lakhs as of 12pm IST on September 2.

The SEC said investors in a BitConnect ""lending programme"" were told BitConnect used a ""volatility software trading bot"" that could generate returns of 40 percent per month, and were given fictitious returns showing 3,700 percent annualised gains.

But the regulator said investors lost much of their money after the price of BitConnect Coin sank 92 percent on January 16, 2018.

Prosecutors said BitConnect ran a ""textbook Ponzi scheme"" by paying earlier investors with new investor money.

Kumbhani, 35, has lived in Surat, India but his whereabouts are unknown, while Arcaro, 44, lives in Los Angeles and incorporated Future Money in Hong Kong, authorities said.

Efforts to locate Kumbhani were unsuccessful. Arcaro's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.

The SEC sued five other BitConnect promoters on May 28.

It has obtained judgments requiring two promoters, Michael Noble and Joshua Jeppesen, and Jeppesen's fiancee to pay more than $3.5 million (roughly Rs. 25 crores) and BTC 190. The other promoters have not responded to the lawsuit or not been served.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_disco_reuters_1622203490843.jpg',)",none

Cryptocurrency experts believe it will surpass traditional finance in Australia as early as 2029 after a new report revealed the country had accumulated $7bn worth of digital coins.

Comparison site Finder has released its annual Cryptocurrency Report with some significant revelations, including that 31 per cent of Gen Z Australians (born after 1997) own some form of crypto.

Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital forms of money that take on the form of tokens or “coins” using cryptography, making it difficult to be counterfeited.

Australians have amassed $7bn worth of cryptocurrency, with the average investor owning $2078 in assets.

Overall, 17 per cent of Australians own cryptocurrency, while a further 13 per cent said they intended to buy it within the next year.

A nationally representative Finder survey also found 56 per cent of Australians believed tech billionaire Elon Musk invented Bitcoin.

Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, owned by 9 per cent of Australian crypto investors, followed by Ethereum (8 per cent), Dogecoin (5 per cent) and Bitcoin Cash (4 per cent).

The biggest revelation out of Finder’s report is that almost 31 per cent of Gen Z Australians (aged 24 and under) own cryptocurrency, and that figure has more than doubled since January.

But ownership of digital coins has dropped in other generations.

Finder’s cryptocurrency expert James Edwards said Gen Z’s behaviour was a sign traditional finance was being phased out in a bold prediction for its future.

“Many Aussies are now much more clear on the benefits cryptocurrencies offer, such as Bitcoin being a hedge against fiat currency and inflation, plus the ability to earn interest on assets through things like stablecoins and decentralised finance on Ethereum,” he said.

Fred Schebesta says the growth in cryptocurrency will explode.

“If the pace of education continues to grow, combined with easier access to cryptocurrencies, we should expect to see it as a dominant financial industry by the end of the decade, especially among younger generations who have never had meaningful access to traditional finance.”

Finder founder Fred Schebesta also predicted digital coins were about to explode.

“As the technology develops and there are easier ways to access it – like in the Finder app where you can buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in a few clicks – I believe the growth in cryptocurrency will explode,” he said.

The report emphasised social media will underpin the growth of cryptocurrencies.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/80971fc577bc8a4140540022df38d45e',)",none

Billionaire John Paulson says cryptocurrencies are a bubble, will prove to be worthless



Cryptocurrencies, despite being considered among the market's hot commodities, have drawn sharp criticism from billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson who described it as a ""bubble"" that would prove to be ""worthless"". Paulson, while speaking at an episode of 'Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein' aired on August 30, said there is no intrinsic value attached with cryptocurrencies except for a ""limited amount"". The segment is ""too volatile"", he said, pointing out that Bitcoin went from US$5,000 to US$45,000 within a short period. Read it here.

Bitcoin's price dropped another 2.82 percent to $47,055. Ether was up 0.83 percent at $3218.52. Despite record accumulation and supply shock events, Bitcoin's price drops to $46.7K. Bitcoin prices have risen sharply as a result of several favorable occurrences, but comments made by well-known persons about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, in general, are dragging it down.

Cardano

During the most recent ADA price spike, Cardano (ADA) addresses with a balance of more than $1 million had risen 173 percent.

After bottoming out at $1.007 on July 20, the ADA/USD exchange rate climbed about 200 percent. In the previous session, the pair hit a new high of $3.02, which was followed by a 6.42 percent price drop to $2.73 at the time of writing.

Pay Pal

After establishing bitcoin trading services last year, PayPal is apparently looking into ways to offer stock trading.

According to a report published on Aug. 30, PayPal is trying to buy or collaborate with a broker-dealer to launch its own stock trading service to compete with rivals such as crypto-friendly stock trading software Robinhood.

NFT

After seeing the hype about Dogecoin (DOGE), which was mostly spearheaded by Elon Musk, Naomi Osaka, a top professional tennis player from Japan, has been outspoken about diversifying her assets in cryptocurrencies.

CBDC

Bitt Inc, a Barbados-based fintech startup, would serve as the Central Bank of Nigeria's technical partner for the proposed e-naira digital money.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said on Monday that it has picked Bitt Inc because of its ""technical competence, efficiency, platform security, interoperability, and implementation experience.""

2021-08-31,,Payments: Kerala firm opts for cryptocurrency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/payments-kerala-firm-opts-for-cryptocurrency/articleshow/85780181.cms,"Kochi: Athey Nallatha , a Kerala startup that sells fusion pickles to the domestic as well as a global clientele, becomes the first company in Kerala which is ready to accept cryptocurrency for its payments. It is also the seventh firm in India to enter into cryptocurrency-based transactions, the startup claimed.On Aug 28, 2021, the startup opened its payment gateway by CoinBase to customers. Digital currencies accepted on this portal are Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, DAI, and USDC, though a transaction is yet to happen.When questioned why they included cryptocurrency as a mode of payment, apart from cards, UPI and Google Pay, while it is yet to gain popularity in the country, Akshay Raveendran, co-founder and director, Athey Nallatha said, “The promoters have been involved with cryptocurrency right from the inception itself – we used to keep track and invest in them. Also, if we implement blockchain technology on the operations side, it is going to save us a lot of money and customers are also going to benefit from this. There are major scaling plans but as a starting step, we have done this.”Interestingly, the startup doesn’t accept cash due to the pandemic. Founded in June 2020, during the pandemic, by two management graduates Hafez Rahman and Akshay Raveendran, Athey Nallatha also aims at providing employment opportunities to mothers.“We source vegetables and meat products from local farmers in and around Kochi. And during the initial days of the pandemic, we couldn’t group the people to work together at a single place to process these raw materials. Hence, we distributed the jobs between various groups of women. While one group took care of vegetable peeling, another took care of cleaning fish. Finally, we collected the products and brought them to a centralized kitchen where it was prepared,” Raveendran said.At present, Athey Nallatha employs 70 women from Panangad, Paravur or Tripunithura – places in and around Kochi. And a number of farmers around Kochi benefitted from local sourcing. “We wanted to stimulate the local economy. During the initial days of Covid, the inter-state trade was disrupted and farmers were affected. So, we decided to source locally only,” said Raveendran.Athey Nallatha sells its products online through its website and Amazon. It also sells them via 30 retail stores. For serving the Middle Eastern clientele, the startup is tying up with online portal Noon.com. Raveendran said he got the first direct order from Germany and the shipments are going soon.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-31,Business Standard,Hottest cryptocurrencies are alternatives to Bitcoin and Ether,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/hottest-cryptocurrencies-are-alternatives-to-bitcoin-and-ether-121083100046_1.html,"FOMO remains alive and well in the cryptocurrency world, with lesser-known tokens outperforming again in the wake of recent rallies staged by industry leaders and Ether.



Cardano has doubled this month, becoming the third-largest digital asset. Binance Coin is also up. A token named Avalanche has tripled in August. Meanwhile, prices for digital photos of rocks with laser eyes and cartoon depictions of cute animals are going gangbusters, sometimes quadrupling in a matter of days.

Among analysts and investors, there’s little consensus as to what’s driving parts of the frenzy. Some posit that speculators are moving from the mainstays to newer, more exciting offshoots, as they often do after big runs. Others see a world awash in cash and ultra-low rates, which ultimately pushes investors toward ever-wonkier assets. A few tokens are backed by strong narratives, such as technological advances at the Cardano and Solana networks.

“There’s no doubt that there’s a lot of excitement in crypto,” said Yoni Assia, founder and chief executive of online exchange eToro. “You can definitely see it within the numbers in the industry, whether it’s looking at total volumes or looking at growth of companies,” he said, adding that “we’ve seen a lot of exuberance in the market.”





Assia calls it a “generational buying moment” and cites a confluence of events, including rock-bottom interest rates worldwide, as well as massive fiscal stimulus efforts that delivered checks to many people during the pandemic.

Some of that money has gone toward and related assets, such as stocks of digital miners. About 15% of Americans who received the first two stimulus checks invested part or all of the money, and about half of this group invested specifically in cryptocurrencies, according to a survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults conducted by The Harris Poll for Yahoo Finance.

At the same time, inflation has materialized as economies reopen, playing into the warnings from some crypto faithful of pending hyperinflation. Put all that together and it’s “leading a lot of people to look for various types of investments,” Assia said.

A recent survey by eToro found that roughly a quarter of the 6,000 investors queried own crypto, a number that increases to nearly 50% for the younger cohort. The company also found that the average investor was set to increase their crypto allocation in the coming months and that interest in alternatives to and Ether, or altcoins, is “significant.”

Meanwhile, downloads for crypto trading apps are rising -- Coinbase Global Inc. ranked 11th among finance apps in Apple’s iPhone downloads, according to App Annie, a mobile data and analytics provider. It averaged 23rd within its category last August. Digital exchanges Kraken, Voyager and Crypto.com have also advanced in the ranks.





“With all of this money floating around, we should not be surprised that there are people paying exorbitant amounts of money for digital pet rocks and an endless amount of other digital assets that can be easily created,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.

The space is dominated by younger generations, he said, and all they know is a Federal Reserve that’s been almost-perpetually accommodative. Take that, alongside a gridlocked government, and it’s no surprise many have gravitated toward the crypto space, he said.

Since July, assets under management for digital-asset investment products rose more than 57% to roughly $55 billion. Average daily aggregate trading volumes increased more than 46% to $544 million, the biggest month-over-month rise since May, according to data-tracker CryptoCompare.

A lot of the attention’s been placed on altcoins such as Cardano, Avalanche and the meme mainstay Dogecoin. Meantime, an index tracking some of the largest decentralized finance protocols and apps -- the Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index -- is up about 50% since the start of July.

“There’s generally been pretty positive crypto sentiment recently: NFTs have helped lead the revival, and the crash from May is further in the rearview mirror,” said Sam Bankman-Fried, chief executive officer of crypto exchange FTX.

And then there are the blockchains looking to compete with Ethereum. Avi Felman, co-portfolio manager at BlockTower Capital, said now that Ethereum’s recent network upgrade is done, speculators are turning their attention toward rival blockchains and their tokens.

Meanwhile, the U.S. equity markets seem to post records daily. Meme stocks are going bonkers too. Jason Urban, co-head of Galaxy Digital Trading, said when the market’s in a such a risk-on mood, crypto can only benefit.

In the four years ending in 2019, correlations between and daily returns for the S&P 500 were generally small, according to Wei Liang at DBS in Singapore. But starting last year, that changed. Amid the pandemic, Bitcoin and U.S. stocks have fallen and rebounded jointly, he said.

“Lately, you see people are concerned about inflation, people are concerned about money supply -- because of that, historically, people always said buy stocks as a hedge against inflation,” Urban said. Now, he added, it’s crypto as well.","('https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2021-08/31/full/1630353924-4152.jpg',)",none

In response to the speech, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell, the S&P 500 index rose to a new all-time high, and Bitcoin (BTC) surged about $1,500 in under an hour. This showed that market participants viewed the speech as “dovish.”

Bitcoin’s uncertainty near the $50,000 mark has analysts divided about its short-term directional move. Analyst Ryan Clark believes the current consolidation in Bitcoin is similar to the one seen below $24,000 before the breakout in December 2020, but TraderXO believes that BTC may correct to the $39,000 to $42,000 zone in September.

Will Bitcoin’s consolidation below $50,000 attract buying in altcoins? Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the next few days.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin bounced off the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), calculated at $46,823, on Aug. 27, but the bulls have not been able to push the price above the overhead resistance zone at $50,000 to $50,500. This suggests that bears have not thrown in the towel yet.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price turns down from the current level and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the short-term traders are booking profits. That may pull the price down to $43,927 and then to $42,451.

If the price rebounds off this support, the BTC/USDT pair may remain range-bound between $42,451 and $50,500 for a few more days.

Alternatively, if the price turns up from the current level or bounces off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the overhead zone. If they manage to do that, the pair may start its journey toward $60,000.

The moving averages on the four-hour chart have flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is close to the midpoint, indicating a range-bound action in the near term. The price may remain stuck between $46,200 and $49,500 for some time.

If bulls drive the price above $49,500, the pair may challenge the $50,500 resistance. A breakout and close above this level could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. On the contrary, if bears sink the price below $46,200, the pair may drop to $44,000.

ADA/USDT

Cardano (ADA) is currently consolidating between $2.97 and $2.47. The price had dropped to the breakout level at $2.47 on Aug. 26, but the sharp rebound off it on Aug. 27 shows that bulls have flipped the level into support.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

A consolidation near the all-time high is a positive sign as it shows that traders continue to buy on dips. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If buyers drive and sustain the price above the psychological barrier at $3, the ADA/USDT pair could resume its uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $3.50.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the $2.97-to-$3 resistance zone, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. A break and close below $2.47 will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened.

The RSI on the four-hour chart has formed a negative divergence, indicating that the upward momentum may be slowing down. If bears pull and sustain the price below the 50-day simple moving average, the pair may drop to $2.47.

A strong bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $2.47 and $2.97 for some time. The bears will have to sink the price below the $2.47-to-$2.31 support zone to gain the upper hand. Alternatively, the uptrend may resume if bulls drive and sustain the price above $2.97.

LUNA/USDT

Terra protocol’s LUNA token is in a strong uptrend. After a few days of consolidation, the price rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($26.42) on Aug. 27, indicating that the sentiment remains positive.

LUNA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that bulls have the upper hand. The first target objective on the upside is a move to $43 and, if that level is crossed, the LUNA/USDT pair may rally to $50.

However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests that bears are defending the overhead resistance aggressively. If bears pull the price below $32, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA.

This is an important level for the bulls to defend. A strong bounce off it will suggest that the uptrend remains intact, but a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate that the bullish momentum has weakened.

The four-hour chart shows a broadening triangle formation, which indicates an increase in volatility. The buyers had pushed the price above the triangle but they could not sustain the breakout, suggesting aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels.

If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again make one more attempt to clear the overhead hurdle. If bulls sustain the price above the triangle, it may signal the resumption of the up-move. The pattern target of this setup is $46.95.

Alternatively, if the price breaks below the moving averages, the pair could drop to the support line of the triangle. A break and close below this support will signal that bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair may then drop to the $22.40-to-$20.81 support zone.

VET/USDT

After the sharp recovery from its recent lows at $0.05 on July 21, VeChain (VET) has formed a pennant. This setup will complete after the price breaks above or below the formation.

VET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.11) has flattened out and the RSI has dropped close to the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. A breakout and close above the resistance line of the pennant will suggest the resumption of the up-move.

The first target objective on the upside is a move to $0.16 and, if this level is crossed, the VET/USDT pair may rally to $0.19.

Conversely, if the price breaks below the support line of the pennant, the bullish view will be negated. The pair could then decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.09).

The four-hour chart shows the price is getting squeezed inside the triangle. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

The rebound off the support line is facing stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA. If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to sink the pair below the support line. If they succeed, the pair may drop to $0.082.

On the other hand, if bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair could challenge the resistance line. A breakout and close above this resistance could signal the resumption of the up-move.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) completed a rounding-bottom pattern when the price broke and closed above the overhead resistance at $4.47. This suggests the start of a new uptrend that has a pattern target at $6.85.

XTZ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Usually, after the price breaks out of a setup, it retests the breakout level. In this case, the XTZ/USDT pair could drop to $4.47. If bulls flip this level into support, it will suggest the start of a new uptrend. The rising 20-day EMA ($4.25) and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate advantage to buyers.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could trap several aggressive bulls and result in a decline to the 50-day SMA ($3.31).

The four-hour chart shows that the pair picked up momentum after it rose above the $4.47 resistance. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand.

The pair could rally to the overhead resistance zone at $6.31 to $6.50, where bears may mount a stiff resistance. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day EMA. That could open the doors for a decline to the breakout level at $4.47.

The native asset of the Cardano blockchain, ADA, hit a new high on Monday as investors pinned their hopes on an impending smart contracts feature that is expected to accelerate the cryptocurrency's adoption.

Cosmos (ATOM)

The widely anticipated distribution of the London hard fork on the Ethereum (ETH) network has done little to solve the network's high transaction fees and delayed confirmations, therefore momentum for the top layer-one protocols has been on the rise throughout August.

U.S. Senator Pat Toomey is soliciting ideas and proposals on cryptocurrency regulation. He explained that he “intends to use the responses in forming legislation that clarifies ambiguity around how existing laws, especially in the tax and securities realms, may apply to cryptocurrencies.”

US Senator Pat Toomey Seeks Proposals on Crypto Regulation

The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs announced Thursday that Ranking Member Pat Toomey is requesting “feedback on clarifying laws around cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.” The committee will collect proposals from Aug. 26 to Sept. 27. All proposals will subsequently be published.

Senator Toomey detailed that he is “soliciting ideas and legislative proposals to ensure federal law supports the development of emerging cryptocurrency and open blockchain network technologies while continuing to protect crypto investors.”

He explained that he “intends to use the responses in forming legislation that clarifies ambiguity around how existing laws, especially in the tax and securities realms, may apply to cryptocurrencies.”

The senator emphasized:

Rather than trying to ignore or suppress cryptocurrency and related technologies, regulators and legislators alike need to recognize that open, public networks are here to stay. Our laws and regulations must adapt to these developments.

Potential topics that the proposals should address include securities implications of cryptocurrencies, payments and money transmission supervision, stablecoins, cryptocurrency exchanges, custody regulation, banking authorities, and decentralized finance (defi).

“Not only might cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies be as revolutionary as the internet, [but] they also have the potential to build wealth and financial independence for individuals who are empowered to engage in financial transactions directly with each other, free from oft-costly middlemen,” Senator Toomey continued, elaborating:

That’s why it’s important Congress gets this right and ensures the United States remains at the forefront of cryptocurrency and fintech innovation.

2021-08-29,CNBC,Cuba's central bank now recognizes cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/cubas-central-bank-now-recognizes-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin.html,"Thousands of Cubans take part in rare protests against the communist government, marching through a town chanting ""Down with the dictatorship"" and ""We want liberty"" in Havana, on July 11, 2021.

Cuba will now recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, citing ""reasons of socioeconomic interest.""

Resolution 215, which was published Thursday in the state-run Official Gazette, says the central bank will set new rules for how to deal with digital currencies. Commercial providers of related services will now need a license from the central bank to continue operations.

The American embargo on the communist state has turned Cuba into a pariah in the global economy. Cuba's decision to join El Salvador in embracing decentralized virtual cash could help the country to circumvent the U.S. sanctions regime, which was dialed up under former President Donald Trump and has been extended under President Joe Biden.

""It's historic that they are embracing it,"" said Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst, who spent four years working in crypto in Cuba.

""This is a conservative government still set in traditional Marxist ways. In fact, the communist Cuban central bank was founded by Che Guevara. The fact that they are cautiously regulating shows they are interested in what it can bring them,"" Boaz said.

Sending and receiving money between the U.S. and Cuba became extremely difficult under the Trump administration, according to Dr. Mrinalini Tankha, a professor of anthropology at Portland State University, who has been doing research on Cuba for 10 years.

In 2020, Western Union, a particularly significant channel for remittances that had been operating in Cuba for more than 20 years, shuttered all of its 400-plus locations, amid increasingly aggressive Trump-era sanctions.

The process of getting money into and out of the country was made even more complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Before the Covid outbreak, Tankha said, some Cubans would turn to underground and somewhat semi-formalized courier services called mulas, where agencies would carry cash to Cuba and distribute it to people on the island. But as the pandemic grounded flights around the world, even this path to cash became much more difficult, she said.

It was this desperate need of cash — against a backdrop of a global pandemic and blocked access to the world economy — that helped foment a rise in crypto adoption in Cuba, experts say.

""There is a kind of niche sector of people who have turned to cryptocurrency,"" said Tankha.

She credits the burgeoning crypto community for the rise of the internet in Cuba, as well as the fact that there are so many more people who have smartphones and 3G connectivity. A weak local currency is also a factor likely contributing to the appeal of bitcoin.

The use case for crypto in Cuba transcends the cross-border transfer of money. It's also about Cubans looking to open up their income-generating potential.

""If you're a software developer, or if you're an NFT artist, you could actually get paid through cryptocurrency for your labor, and I think that's where the potential actually is,"" said Tankha. ""It opens up a whole new economy for Cubans to participate in.""

Photographer Gabriel Guerra Bianchini is doing just that. Havana-based Bianchini was one of the first artists in Cuba to break into the world of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.

""My first work sold in six days for 1.6 ethereum,"" said Bianchini. ""This is bigger than just making money. This is really freedom.""

However, receiving funds, even via crypto channels, requires some creativity, because many of the exchanges require know-your-customer compliance.

""The minute that Cubans participate in this ecosystem, they face a lot of risks, even if they're operating with a VPN where they're able to hide their location,"" said Tankha.

Tankha told CNBC that many exchanges, including those not based in the U.S., continue to geo-block Cubans.

Experts told CNBC that it is still a long road ahead for mass adoption of crypto in Cuba.

The resolution itself — while a promising sign for Cubans keen to participate in the world economy via bitcoin rails — is hardly a warm embrace of all things crypto. The text includes a healthy dose of skepticism, such as a disclaimer warning citizens about the risks of virtual assets and the ancillary service providers, which the government says operate at the ""margins of the banking and financial system.""

But Sobrado is optimistic that any sort of regulatory attention with respect to crypto is a good thing.

""Regulators around the world, from communist Cuba's central bank to the SEC, are trying to come to grips with the cryptocurrency industry. This implies that crypto is a global phenomenon and regulators have decided that it's here to stay and worth engaging with,"" said Sobrado.

""Strangely enough it's bringing some sort of legitimacy to the space. It's gotten too big to ignore,"" he said.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106910035-1626177480909-gettyimages-1233929408-AFP_9ER3N8.jpeg?v=1627050044',)",none

Cuba has said it will recognise – and regulate – cryptocurrencies for payments on the island in a move that could help to circumvent American sanctions.

A resolution published in the Official Gazette on Thursday said the central bank will set rules on cryptocurrencies and determine how to license providers of related services within the communist state.

The announcement comes as the popularity of cryptocurrency has grown in Cuba among some technologically savvy groups, as it has become increasingly difficult to send and use US dollars on the island, in part because of toughened embargo rules imposed under former United States President Donald Trump.

While some expected President Joe Biden to seek to normalise relations, as former President Barack Obama did, he has instead taken a harder line, imposing further sanctions against Cuban officials following crackdowns on rare protests in the country.





Cuba’s move comes after El Salvador recently announced it would recognise the use of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as a way to encourage remittances from its citizens living abroad.

The currencies, which can shift wildly in value, are usually independent of any central bank and use widely distributed blockchain computer codes to keep track of transfers.

Because they can be used for long-distance transactions that are supposedly anonymous, they are often popular with people attempting to evade government regulations, which could include circumventing US restrictions on sending money to Cuba.





The resolution said the central bank can authorise use of cryptocurrencies “for reasons of socioeconomic interest” but with the state assuring operations are controlled.

It also explicitly noted that operations could not involve illegal activities.

A local cryptocurrency expert, programmer Erich García, told The Associated Press some Cubans are already using such devices, often via gift cards, for online purchases.","('https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AP21089552118817.jpg?resize=1200%2C630',)",none

Though some recovery has been observed in Bitcoin, all most other popular cryptocurrencies fell.

The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure due to heavy sell-off since Tuesday. Bitcoin was trading at $47,121.64, up 51 per cent at 11:30 am. Bitcoin’s value has fallen over $240 in the past 24 hours and its market capitalisation has increased marginally to $885 billion.

Ether’s valuation has also fallen over the past 24 hours. It was trading at $3,105.63, down 0.48 per cent. It’s market capitalisation has fallen to $363.87 billion. Other altcoins such as XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Stellar, Chainlink, Polygon and Litecoin fell.

Analysts, however, believe that the current weakness in the cryptocurrency market will fade in the near term due as digital coins witness higher adoption across the world.

Commenting on the weakness, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The past 24 hours were highly volatile for the crypto markets. Both Bitcoin and Ether made struggled to find support.”

“The entire market felt the shivers of this volatility. Altcoins went under the hammer,” he added.

“However, towards the end of the day, there was some recovery as Bitcoin seemed to settle around the $47,000 mark.”

The former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was more positive on well-regulated stablecoins. At the same time, he called for quick appropriate regulations for stablecoins.

A stablecoin is a digital currency that is linked to an underlying asset, such as a national currency like the US dollar or a precious metal like gold.

According to the Reuters report, Rajan was, however, not clear on the fundamentals that were driving the valuations of cryptocurrencies.

“Right now, in this heady environment with asset prices really picking up, many cryptos are also being valued — not so much as a means of payments — but as assets in their own right,"" Rajan, who is professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told Reuters.

Even in India, crypto currency exchanges are urging the government to define cryptocurrencies as digital assets and not as currency. As per industry experts, this would help the government address all its legitimate concerns with regards to financial risks associated with crypto.

Meanwhile, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the legislation on cryptocurrencies is awaiting Cabinet approval.

Rajan in his interaction with Reuters opined that some cryptocurrencies might find a way to become an effective means of payment despite their fluctuating values.

“Cross border payments are one area which is wide open, because of the huge transaction costs of making cross border payments,"" he said.

In India, growth-wise, the crypto industry has grown from four-five million people in 2018 to 15-20 million investors now with more than $1.5 billion invested. This has in part been driven by the superlative returns given by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether and dogecoin over the past three years.

Rajan believes that for cryptocurrency prices to keep on rising, these digital assets will need to find a proper use case.

“I think the value of cryptos has to be seen more in terms of are they going to be useful in the system going forward. Yes, some of them have value because they have value, and maybe that will persist. I'm not going to say that bitcoin is going to implode tomorrow. But I will say that I would be much more confident about the value of these cryptos once they find proper use cases, and the technology is evolving to make that happen,"" he said.

The authorities of Spain must prepare a registry of cryptocurrency exchanges and custody providers to comply with legal requirements to address transparency and terrorism financing issues. This registry is specified by the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Law, approved last year. The process, which started in April, gives these service providers until October to register.

Spain to Create Virtual Asset Provider Registry

The Bank of Spain must determine the requirements to start registering cryptocurrency exchanges and custody providers, as determined by Spanish law. The virtual asset service providers must register with the institution to implement anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing measures. This is mandated by the Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Law that was approved last year.

The period established by law to allow these providers to register started in April and ends in October. After that, cryptocurrency service providers will have a second period to register that finishes in January 2022. The law states the purpose of the registry is to:

…improve the mechanisms for the prevention of terrorism and improve the transparency and availability of information about true cryptocurrency owners.

Stringent Regulations

Spain has been busy regulating cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency interactions this year, approving a series of laws that exert more control on crypto and fiat holdings. The so-called anti-fraud law, passed on July 7, establishes that Spanish citizens must disclose their cryptocurrency ownership for assets inside and outside the country. The law also states that custody providers must report information about their customers and their holdings.

The antifraud law prescribes harsh penalties for failure to disclose this information. Customer data will be available to all countries in the European Union, as well. According to Alejandro de la Cruz, a Spanish financial lawyer, the registry will mark a before and after for crypto-related service providers in Spain. This might affect the growth of cryptocurrency adoption in the region because exchanges will have to comply with a lengthy process and identity themselves and their customers to regulators.

However, part of the Spanish congress seems to understand the importance that cryptocurrencies can have in the lives of citizens. A new draft law introduced earlier this month, seeking to modernize the Spanish legal structure, would allow Spanish citizens to pay their mortgages with cryptocurrency.

Crypto prices started falling after Monday’s trading session due to heavy profit-booking, and have remained weak since then. Experts believe volatility in crypto trade is also a result of monthly options expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, is trading slightly below $47,000, down 2.95 per cent at 12:07 pm. The virtual coin’s market capitalisation has fallen sharply to $882 billion.

It may be noted that Bitcoin had touched a high of $50,000 on Monday and its market capitalisation has inched closer to $950 billion.

Ether’s (ETH) value has also eroded sharply over the past 24 hours. It was trading at $3,109, down over 3 per cent compared to its value 24 hours ago. Ether’s market capitalisation has fallen to $363 billion.

All other altcoins also lost ground, trading 3-8 per cent lower due to the selloff observed over the past 24 hours.

Commenting on the cryptocurrency market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “The crypto markets were highly volatile over the past 24 hours. Such volatility is often encountered before the monthly options expiry.”

“The spot trading volume for Bitcoin was low, indicating that the markets are not directional at the moment. Despite a minor selloff in Ether, the largest Altcoin still appears to have a strong support,” he added.

“Most other Altcoins would be replicating the movement in BTC and ETH.”

Here are the latest prices and trends of popular cryptocurrencies:

The world’s largest crypotcurrency was trading at $48,373, up 0.43 per cent at the time of this article. The cryptocurrency on Monday surged to $50,000, which happened for the first time after the crash that happened in May this year. In April, the world biggest currency Bitcoin surged and hit an all-time high at $65,000. Bitcoin has risen and recovered after hovering in the range of $30,000 to $40,000 for many weeks. Bitcoin steeply fell from $65,000 in April to $28,800 in June, after a massive sell-off in June and July, triggered by Chinese ban on the corporates, financial companies, payment companies, providing services related to cryptocurrency.

This week two announcements made by Paypal and Coinbase pulled up the Bitcoin around $50,000 mark.

According to Zebpay trade desk, Bitcoin has touched the $50,000 mark for the first time since May and has surged almost by 72 per cent from its recent low of $29,301. Technically on the weekly time frame, the asset is trading in an uptrend forming a ‘Higher Highs Higher Lows’ pattern. BTC may face some resistance around $51,109 levels (61.8 per cent Fibonacci Retracement Level) and if these levels are breached with good volumes then we can expect the asset to further rally up to $57,000.

On the other hand, Ether, the rival currency of Bitcoin was trading at $3166 or down 0.86 per cent at the time of this article. It was trading up 5.97 per cent over the last week. The market cap for Ether stood at $375.72 billion. The third spot was occupied by Cardano, which was trading at $2.66, down 3.53 per cent at the time of this article. The Cardano was trading up 26.31 per cent over the last week.

Binance Coin stood at $501.72, up 4.09 per cent over the past 24 hours. The Binance Coin was trading up 26.41 per cent over the last week. The market cap for Binance Coin stood at $85.5 billion.

The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $112.54B, which makes a 5.19 per cent decrease. The total volume in DeFi is currently $15.72B, 13.97 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins is now $88.73B, which is 78.84 per cent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per the Coinmarketcap.com.

“The cryptocurrency spectrum kept searching for a sturdy support. Bitcoin hovered above the $48,000 level, allowing bears to enter the markets. Despite a minor correction, there is no reason to fret. The bulk of the activity is in the derivatives market as over $1.7 billion worth of contracts will expire in the next two days. Long-term investors should choose to ignore such noise in the crypto markets. Markets would look to find support towards the end of this month,"" Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder, Mudrex- A Global Crypto Trading Platform said.

2021-08-29,CNBC,"TikTok changed its policies, now cryptocurrency influencers consider moving to rival platforms",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/tiktok-policy-change-hurt-cryptocurrency-creators.html,"In this article BTC.CB=

A man holding a phone walks past a sign of Chinese company ByteDance's app TikTok, known locally as Douyin, at the International Artificial Products Expo in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China October 18, 2019. Reuters

If Lucas Dimos gets one more video removed from TikTok, he suspects he'll get kicked off the platform forever. In the last month, at least 10 of his videos have been taken down for promoting illegal activities and regulated goods. But Dimos, who posts content on a TikTok account called theblockchainboy, says he hasn't done anything wrong. ""It's left my account on such a razor's edge,"" said Dimos. ""We're dying out here. We're floundering. We've tried to build a community and guide this whole movement in the right direction."" TikTok cryptocurrency content creators like Dimos, who claim they are just trying to educate consumers about the emerging market, say they have been hard hit by rapid changes at the social media company. In July, TikTok implemented a system that can automatically block videos violating its policies, and the company recently updated its branded content policy, barring the promotion of financial services including cryptocurrencies, unless users disclose it through a branded content option in the app. CNBC spoke with 11 cryptocurrency creators for this story who say they have posted educational crypto videos, yet their content is getting flagged or taken down permanently with little explanation from TikTok. Some said their accounts are also getting temporarily banned more frequently. Most of the influencers CNBC spoke with said they haven't been paid to promote any crypto content on TikTok in the last few weeks, and that video views and new followers have dwindled since July.

TikTok declined to comment on the reports from creators. Instead, a spokesperson pointed CNBC to the company's community guidelines page. The spokesperson would not specify which guidelines crypto creators were violating. When videos are pulled from TikTok, the creators say they get a notification that they violated community guidelines. Sometimes it notes that they posted content related to 'illegal activities and regulated goods.' The guidelines haven't been updated since December, though TikTok rolled out its new detection feature a little over a month ago, when creators say the takedowns ramped up. Some of the creators CNBC spoke with are considering shifting to platforms like Google-owned YouTube, Twitter, Facebook's Instagram and the chatting app Discord, where they say they have more freedom to share content. ""The real issue isn't the advertisements,"" said a cryptocurrency influencer who goes by Wendy O. ""It's the fact that TikTok is shadow banning and censoring crypto content creators and a lot of us are posting great educational pieces.""

Navigating unknown terrain

The creators CNBC spoke with say the recent updates are warranted to crackdown on spam accounts or fraudulent money-making schemes like ""rug pulls,"" where individuals entice users to buy into a crypto, prop up the price and pull out. But they say the system is overcompensating and affecting those who are just trying to educate their audiences about crypto. ""It was almost like a knee-jerk reaction from TikTok against all of these scams that were going on,"" said Dimos, who has over 314,000 followers on the platform. ""While they may have blocked the scam posts, all of us creators are unable to post any of our content."" In recent weeks, creators say they can't use words like ""Binance,"" ""decentralized finance,"" or specific coins like bitcoin or ethereum in a video without it getting removed. The consensus among creators is that those words alert the algorithm, leading to an automatic takedown or review. Chart analysis and forecasting also flag the system, according to creators like Timothy, who goes by cryptoweatherman on TikTok. Under its community guidelines, TikTok says it will remove content ""including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, and text"" in violation, and that it uses a ""mix of technology and human moderation"" to enforce its guidelines before content is even reported. If a video is removed, the user is typically notified that the post violates a community guideline or relates to ""illegal activities and regulated goods."" But the message doesn't offer specifics, the creators said. The creators CNBC spoke with said if they get two videos taken down, they are banned from posting content for at least 24 hours. Bans can last anywhere from a day to a week, the creators who CNBC spoke with said. TikTok's guidelines say that users are notified when content is removed and that they can appeal the takedown if they ""believe no violation has occurred."" The company also says it will suspend or ban accounts that are repeatedly ""involved in severe or repeated violations"" and that they take into account ""information available on other platforms and offline in these decisions."" When the creators reach out to TikTok about an account ban or pulled video, most say they have been ignored or sent an automated response. There's no phone number to call, no representative to email, yet, some creators say when they appeal the takedown TikTok reinstates many videos. Joshua Thillens, who goes by Joshua Jake on TikTok, says he's had at least eight videos taken down. When CNBC spoke with Mason Versluis, a creator with nearly 430,000 followers on an account called cryptomasun, he was experiencing a 48-hour ban, which prevented him from posting. Prior to the guideline change, Versluis had one video taken down showing a car crash. In the last few weeks, he said between 30 and 35 of his videos have been taken down. Most were reinstated after he submitted an appeal. ""I'm not claiming to be a financial wizard or a financial advisor or even a trader,"" Versluis said. ""I'm simply someone who's been in crypto for four years. I've studied this in-depth and the information I bring and the opinions should speak for themselves.""

Views and followers reach a bottleneck

Many creators also say views and followers have slowed in recent weeks and followers say the creators aren't showing up on their ""For You"" pages. TikTok's community guidelines say the company may limit a post's visibility in search results and other feeds. Mack Lorden, who has over 102,000 followers on TikTok, says he quickly built his following when he launched his platform in January. But he ""reached a bottleneck"" last month, a change he attributes to both the guideline change and the price drop in the crypto market. Smaller creators like Miguel Morales, who has a little over 5,200 followers on his account called blockchaincrusader, are also feeling the pinch. Morales says views have dropped on good videos from almost 100,000 to 10,000. On a good day, he's lucky to get over 1,000 views. Nick Dye, who has over 14,400 followers on his account called the_cryptokeeper, says he was getting 300 to 400 followers a day consistently within the first few months of launching his account and after posting a viral video. He said new followers went from hundreds to maybe three or six per day after the policy change. His first 12,000 followers he says he got in just 25 days. The last couple thousand has taken double the time. ""No one knows what they can and can't say,"" Dye said. ""It discourages the newer creators like myself that have the knowledge and experience that they can offer. We're scared to share things for fear of getting banned.""

Getting creative with crypto content

In the weeks since the changes, creators say they are getting creative with the content they post. Wendy O. recently posted a series of videos referring to cryptocurrencies as ketos. Dye calls ethereum his ""girlfriend."" Carla Nasui and Walker Van Dixhorn, who are known as The Crypto Couple, have always used comedy to discuss crypto, a setup they say has kept them from getting banned. Morales has cut back from making three videos a day to just two. Some creators CNBC spoke with have done sponsored content in the past and say they can make anywhere from $300 to $20,000, depending on their following. That payment is occasionally made in cryptocurrencies. Versluis has partnered with DAO Maker, a crowdfunding platform that also serves as a launchpad for some cryptos, and IOI, one of the cryptocurrencies launched through it. Wendy O. created content for a platform involved in crypto-lending called Celsius. Some also make money through paid Discord subscriptions and one-on-one investing sessions. But all of the creators CNBC interviewed said they make most of their content for fun or to educate the masses and they never explicitly tell users to buy into a coin.

Bitcoin prices were trading below $49,000 today in cryptocurrency. On Monday, the world's largest coin broke above $50,000 for the first time since mid-May, as crypto prices began their recovery from a wild three-month run. Bitcoin is up 65 percent this year, but it's still a long way from its April high of just under $65,000.

Bitcoin's price has dropped nearly 2% to $48,230. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency and the unit linked to the Ethereum blockchain, fell almost 2.5 percent to $3,211. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was trading at $0.29 with a 6% drop. Other digital coins such as Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, and Cardano have all dropped 3-7 percent in the last 24 hours.

Coinbase

Following instances of consumers' accounts being stolen and monies being syphoned, Coinbase has been chastised for poor customer service.

Thousands of consumers around the country have filed complaints about the corporation, according to a Tuesday probe.

The local Department of Finance has made it obvious that it wants a piece of earnings generated by playing Axie and other play-to-earn games, despite the game's huge success in the Philippines.

According to an Inquirer report from August 23, Philippine Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko clarified that any gains earned through play-to-earn games are taxable.

Facebook

According to David Marcus, Facebook's head of financial services, the firm is ""certainly thinking about"" leveraging its Novi digital wallet to support non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Marcus stated that Facebook is in an excellent position to explore supporting NFTs through its new digital wallet, while it is too early to discuss particular plans.

(Photo: Reuters)

Cryptocurrency adoption has rapidly gained momentum in India despite uncertainty around the future of the unregulated digital asset. Investments in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, has registered a breathtaking rise in India since 2020.

Data from several domestic cryptocurrency exchanges suggest that millions of retail investors have signed up on their portals to invest in cryptocurrencies — an asset class known for notorious volatility and potential to deliver high returns.

At least 1.5 crore Indians have invested in cryptocurrencies, signalling strong cryptocurrency growth in a nation where households are known to invest more frequently in gold and other safer assets. The growing number of crypto adopters also suggests a shift in the investment paradigm, driven mostly by the country's younger population.

Explained: The good, bad and ugly of investing in cryptocurrencies

WHY MORE INDIANS ARE SHIFTING TO CRYPTOCURRENCIES?

More Indians started investing in cryptocurrencies from 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic led to a global economic crisis, resulting in higher volatility and depreciation in traditional assets like currencies, bonds and equities. As a result, more people around the globe started investing in cryptocurrencies.

This resulted in a sharp rise in crypto valuations throughout 2020, led by popular virtual coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

In India, cryptocurrency investments grew from approximately $923 million in April 2020 to a whopping $6.6 billion in May 2021. India ranks 11th out of 154 nations in terms of cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report prepared by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.

While investments in gold are considered as an ideal hedge in times of economic downturn, more young Indians seem to have changed their appetite. As the situation stands, digital coin investments form a faction of bullion market holdings but younger Indians — between the age group of 18 and 35 years — find cryptocurrency a better option compared to gold.

The latest World Gold Council data also show that Indian adults, aged 34 or less, have a lower appetite for gold. A number of cryptocurrency experts said the tech-savvy younger population find it easier to invest in cryptocurrency than gold due to the processes involved.

WILL MORE INDIANS JOIN THE CRYPTO RACE?

Many Indians want to invest in cryptocurrencies but are worried about the asset’s uncertain future in the country. But data from domestic cryptocurrency exchanges indicate healthy growth in the number of investors.

Popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the country including WazirX, ZebPay, Unocoin and CoinDCX have seen massive growth in retail investors on their platform since 2020. They have recently seen a sharp rise in investors, days before Bitcoin’s value crossed $50,000 after a period of three months.

It may be noted that cryptocurrencies hit a rough patch earlier this year when China started a regulatory crackdown on virtual coins. The negative momentum dented the crypto market for months, following which virtual coins have recovered again.

Experts tracking the sector and founders of cryptocurrency exchanges believe that rapid fintech advancements and greater adoption will lead to a rise in the number of Indians investing in cryptocurrencies in the near future.

In fact, some of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges have invested in India due to growing virtual coin trade volumes and the rising number of retail participants. While there is uncertainty over the cryptocurrency ecosystem in India, global coin exchanges have found it hard to ignore the potential for growth in a country of 1.3 billion people.

Domestic exchanges are confident that more investors will join the cryptocurrency race in India after Bitcoin’s recent advance. After Bitcoin crossed $50,000 on Monday, cryptocurrency exchanges have seen a jump in their trading volumes and the value of investments.

The recent surge in the cryptocurrency market has not only led to a jump in new investors but also rekindled interest among old traders. Many analysts feel that the recent jump in virtual coin prices is linked to the rise in global cryptocurrency adoption.

LOOKING BEYOND BITCOIN

Experts tracking the cryptocurrencies have observed another positive trend: There is less panic among investors during sudden market dips and high volatility.

Many cryptocurrency exchange owners feel that investors have developed a greater understanding of the virtual coin market, leading to sustained trading rather than just plain buying.

Investors have realised that investing in smaller cryptocurrencies could reap as much profit as Bitcoin or Ether. As Indian investors dive deeper into the world of cryptocurrencies, they have started looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ether, which are expensive compared to altcoins — a term given other popular cryptocurrencies in the virtual coin ecosystem.

FACTBOX — CRYPTOCURRENCY ADOPTION IN INDIA At least 1.5 crore Indians hold cryptocurrencies assets Cryptocurrency investments have grown rapidly in India to $6.6 billion as of May 2021 Indians aged between 18-35 years are primarily driving cryptocurrency investments in the country India ranks 11th out of 154 nations in terms of cryptocurrency adoption Cryptocurrency exchanges feel more Indians want to invest in digital coins but are worried about the future Global cryptocurrency exchanges have invested heavily in India despite uncertainties

Instead of buying expensive cryptos such as Bitcoin and Ether, investors are also putting their money on lower-priced virtual coins such as XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Polkadot, Chainlink, Solana, UniSwap and more.

As mentioned earlier, calculated investments in altcoins could lead to massive gains as well. For instance, Cardano witnessed a sharp surge in valuation over the past few weeks. Therefore, any investment in Cardano over the past week could have led to healthy gains.

There is a notion, however, that Bitcoin’s value is still a driving factor behind the movements of altcoins. While this is true to some extent, there are days when altcoins outperform market leaders like Bitcoin and Ether. This is similar to when stock market madcaps and small caps outperform benchmarks like Sensex and Nifty.

ALL EYES ON THE GOVERNMENT'S CRYPTO BILL

Cryptocurrency trade has witnessed a boom in India over the past couple of years and there is scope for better growth, but there is one major hurdle. Regulatory uncertainty remains at large as the government is yet to come out with its cryptocurrency bill.

All eyes remain on the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which will determine the future of virtual coin trade in the country. The bill is currently awaiting approval from the Union Cabinet, following which it will be introduced in parliament.

While the government had earlier said it would enforce a ban on private cryptocurrencies, there has been a change in its stance, with officials hinting that trading activities could be regulated — a scenario favoured by all major cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country.

Many cryptocurrency exchanges believe that the early adoption of digital coin trade will help India gain an advantage in the rapidly growing global cryptocurrency ecosystem. They also believe that more people will start investing in cryptocurrencies once the government provides some clarity on the subject.","('https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202108/Cryptocurrency_demand_decoded-647x363.png?2E1Rmheloc6oUMCOpIL.mxJiA8dKXWPx',)",none
2021-08-29,News.com.au,Cardano tipped to replace Ethereum as second-largest cryptocurrency,https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/wealth/cardano-tipped-to-overtake-ethereum-as-secondlargest-cryptocurrency/news-story/a5734e7883b9e1781e8b9988cb575d17,"A mostly unknown cryptocurrency is on the right track to take out the number two position and potentially even kick bitcoin out of its prime spot.

A cryptocurrency which seemingly came out of nowhere is on the right track to take out the number two position and potentially even kick bitcoin out of its prime spot.

Confidence is building around cardano, a blockchain invented in 2015, after it overtook binance to come third on the crypto ladder, behind bitcoin and ethereum.

Experts think the coin has set its sights on surpassing ethereum next.

Last week, cardano (known as ADA in the crypto market) surged to a market capitalisation of $111.23 billion, officially overtaking binance which stood at $99.38 billion.

According to cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko, cardano has continued to skyrocket in the past week, rising by 35 per cent to $123.36 billion at time of writing.

Over the past 30 days, the coin has risen to nearly 187 per cent.

It’s believed cardano’s new-found popularity is from of the announcement of a major upgrade to the network called the Alonzo hard fork.

The coin’s more environmentally-friendly processing abilities, and its debut on the Japanese market, are also adding to the fervour.

Cardano is currently selling for $3.85.

Although that’s significantly less than its rival ethereum, which is sitting on $4429.23 per coin, experts have predicted that major gains are on the horizon.

Independent crypto analyst and YouTuber Lark Davis said that if cardano quadruples its value, which is possible given its current gains, it would hit the same market cap as ethereum.

And if it rose by 10 times, then it would have be neck and neck with the largest ever cryptocurrency, bitcoin.

An expert’s prediction on crypto.

What is Cardano?

Perhaps it’s not surprising that cardano is posing a very real threat to ethereum, considering that it was founded by someone who also created the ether token.

Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson created cardano in 2015 and launched it in 2017.

The coin is known as ADA on the crypto market, which is an homage to Augusta “Ada” King, or Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century British countess largely regarded as the first computer programmer.

She was also the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron.

Cardano has just hit the Japanese market.

What is the Alonzo hard fork update?

Last week, cardano announced the Alonzo hard fork which caused interest in the coin to hit an all-time high.

The upgrade allows for smart contracts to happen, which are pieces of computer code that can automatically execute when the right parameters are set.

That means once the Alonzo update is complete, anyone can make their own smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain, paving the way for native decentralised applications (dapps), according to CoinDesk.

Decentralised applications allows people to borrow, lend and trade with each other instantly, without any interference from a third party such as waiting on a bank to make the transaction.

The Alonzo hard fork is the third major update in cardano’s current stage.

The token has five main stages of development, also called “eras” which aim to expand the network and make it run as smoothly as possible.

They are named after famous writers from the Romantic movement of the 1800s: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, Voltaire.

Alonzo is the last major update for the Shelley era and moves the platform towards the Goguen era.

The Alonzo update is expected to begin sometime during the third quarter of this year.

Other reasons for the price spike

Another reason for cardano’s surge is that from Wednesday, the coin will be listed on Japan’s exchange.

Japan’s criteria to enter the market is considered one of the strictest in the world, which is another win for cardano.

Bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin are also on the Japanese market.

Cardano is also hugely popular because its proof of stake blockchain model is considered much more environmentally-friendly than any other mainstream cryptocurrency.

Proof of stake works means coins are randomly allocated to users, cutting down the energy needed for a transaction.

In contrast, bitcoin and ethereum use a proof of work mechanism which sees a global network of computers running simultaneously to facilitate a transaction.

Such a method requires an enormous amount of energy, with Bitcoinenergyconsumption.com estimating that bitcoin generated over 57 million tonnes of CO2 in a year – the same carbon footprint as a small European country.","('https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a751d69b6c9ba78ad577b5b2334101e8',)",none
2021-08-29,The Economic Times,Cardano returns 150% in a month to become the third-largest cryptocurrency,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/cardano-returns-150-in-a-month-to-become-the-third-largest-cryptocurrency/articleshow/85617141.cms,"ET Spotlight Special

ET Spotlight Special

A little-known digital token tied to the Cardano blockchain has just surpassed other top alt-coins to become the third-largest virtual currency worldwide, as network developers aim to capitalise on the surge in decentralised finance that has swept the world.Currently, the popular alt-coin traded on cryptocurrency exchanges like CoinSwitch Kuber , Cardano's native coin, ADA, defied a major price crash warning to rise to an all-time high, surpassing the previous record. For the very first time on Friday, the ADA/USD rate of exchange surpassed $2.56, marking the culmination of a 154.54% price increase that began on July 20. This was achieved despite renowned trader Peter Brandt's warning of a price fall, which was predicated on a typical bearish pattern known as the head and shoulders pattern.With the price of the ADA coin soaring by about 50% in only the past week, there is growing confidence that new technological advancements will enable payment systems on Cardano earlier than the previously declared date of September 12. This will allow its network to provide profitable services like DeFi, where Ethereum presently holds a dominant position.In anticipation of the planned “Alonzo” upgrade, which is scheduled to be released on September 12, ADA investors are continuing to drive the value of Cardano higher. The Alonzo upgrade will bring smart-contract* functionality to the blockchain, allowing Cardano to establish itself as a legitimate player in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space.ADA is among the most highly sought-after cryptocurrencies for new traders due to its still-relatively low price and excellent marketing as one of the potential ""Ethereum killers."" There is little reason to suspect that Cardano is a favourite of the crypto world, and ADA is among the most highly sought-after cryptocurrencies for new traders due to its still-relatively low price and a promising future.With Cardano's ability to handle smart contracts—self-executing agreements among buyers and sellers—the token has gained consistently while Ethereum, Cardano’s core competitor, continues to dominate the growing $100 billion decentralised finance sector.Recently, the Solana blockchain ecosystem began to take shape with DeFi and NFTs, but despite the fact that Cardano has no actual use cases as of yet, the cryptocurrency's market capitalization is about 4x the size of Sol's market capitalization of $20 billion. Cardano has practically risen from the ashes on the backs of speculators and the promise of a fantastic and extremely transparent development team.Smart contracts, also known as blockchain contracts, are distinguished by the method in which they assure conformity between the two parties involved in the transaction. The immutability of a self-executing contract is one of the most notable characteristics of this type of contract. It implies that once codes, regulations, and even transactions have been written into the blockchain, it is hard to reverse, alter, change, or tamper with them.Smart contracts, similar to the traditional ones, are contracts between two or more parties that do not require the participation of a third party to monitor or enforce the agreement.As part of its operation, the blockchain network preserves a transaction record that is visible, secure, and unchangeable, ensuring that evidence of ownership is established and transferred. Contract discussion and application are made considerably more accessible, and the whole edit record of the deal is made publicly visible to all parties involved.When people use decentralised finance, also known as DeFi, they are transferring financial functions directly onto digital ledgers, allowing them to perform things such as, lend or borrow cash and collect interest in a savings-like account, all without the need for traditional middlemen such as banks. Its growing prevalence is part of a broader trend of rising blockchain usage, which is becoming more widespread.A series of recent rises in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, ADA, and other tokens pushed the cryptocurrency market to surpass $2 trillion in value this weekend, a first since the mid-May crash.With a gain of 1,300% in only one year, ADA is among the top-five best-performing cryptocurrencies, outpacing gains of 1,030% for Binance Coin, 330% for Ether, and 59% for Bitcoin, among other cryptocurrencies. The token, on the other hand, is extremely vulnerable to the enormous volatility of the larger cryptocurrency market.As a result of RBI’s crypto crackdown in 2018, the value of ADA plummeted by roughly 90%, ushering in a years-long bear market for the young sector. However, with the emergence of popular crypto exchanges in India, investments in crypto assets jumped from $200 million in 2019 to $40 billion in 2020. As of today, CoinSwitch Kuber , India’s leading crypto exchange has over 9 million registered users invested in crypto.All eyes will now be on the September 12 “Alonzo” upgrade and how it will tie back to ADA’s current positive run. If things go well, ADA could be seen as a primary competitor to Ethereum, ushering yet another era in the cryptocurrency sector.The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.

The entire cryptocurrency market capitalisation has dropped by 4 per cent in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin, which had crossed $50,000 for the first time since May on Monday, retreated yesterday due to profit-booking by investors, according to a Reuters news report quoting Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.

It may be noted that Bitcoin has gained 82 per cent since hitting a yearly low of $27,700 in January. As of 11:20 am, Bitcoin was trading at $48,372.89, down 2.39 per cent. The popular cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation has dipped to $912.19 billion, signalling weakness in the market.

Ether’s valuation fell to $3,212, down nearly 4 per cent. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation dipped to $376 billion. All other altcoins including XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin, Stellar, Polkadot, Uniswap, Chainlink and Litecoin saw a sharp fall in valuation.

Commenting on the weakness in the virtual coin market, Edul Patel, CEO and Co-founder of Mudrex, a global algorithm based crypto trading platform, said, “Bitcoin seems to be facing strong resistance at the current price. Since its drop below $50,000, the bears have been in a dominating position.”

“The nearest strong support is at $46,750. The selloff across most Altcoins was much higher. Over the past 24 hours, we witnessed the entire market cap drop by almost 4%, with traded volumes going up,” he added.

""It indicates the bearish momentum prevailing in the markets currently.”

2021-08-29,The Motley Fool,Why Cryptocurrencies Are Down Big Today,https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/24/why-cryptocurrencies-are-down-big-today/,"What happened

In another volatile day, cryptocurrencies dropped rapidly on Tuesday, more than reversing Monday's gains. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) has fallen 3%, Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) is down 5%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) has dropped 7.6%. Momentum also appears to be pushing these cryptocurrencies lower, so the fall may not be over yet.

As usual, regular volatility is likely the biggest driver with cryptocurrencies simply selling off as investors take profits. But there are some fundamental concerns that investors are likely worried about as well.

So what

I think the biggest concern is hackers stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks. The $600 million hack of the Poly Network hit the sector a couple of weeks ago, but those funds have now been returned. It's a lower-profile $97 million heist last week that investors may just be hearing about. Theives have reportedly already ""cleaned"" $20 million in cryptocurrencies that may not be recovered and it's possible most of the stolen cryptocurrency is gone. If hacking risk grows, it could be terrible for cryptocurrencies long-term.

The regulatory front is full of risks as well. SEC chair Gary Gensler has said he is in favor of rules that protect investors and consumers without completely killing cryptocurrencies. And for now that means treating them as securities, just like any stock or bond. That comes with a double-edged sword: On one hand, it signals legitimacy that could increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies; on the other hand, it could mean broad tax consequences for traders and investors. And with rules still up in the air, it's not surprising to see a pullback when cryptocurrencies rise like they did yesterday.

On the trading angle, it's not unusual for an asset to pull back after a quick increase in price. In the case of each of these cryptocurrencies, you can see that they jumped over 50% in value over the last month, before today's pullback. Sometimes a correction is just a normal part of investing.

Now what

The battle between cryptocurrency fans and the traditional financial infrastructure continues, and it will be a volatile ride. But I think it's clear that cryptocurrencies are carving out a niche for themselves, whether that's as a store of value or a way to pay for goods and services. But there are still unknowns when it comes to how governments around the world will treat cryptocurrencies.

What's most concerning long-term is the regular hacks that hit cryptocurrency wallets. If investors and consumers can't trust that their cryptocurrency will be safe they may not adopt it as widely as many hope. And that's ultimately what will keep cryptocurrency values from growing.

I would chalk today up as another example of volatility in cryptocurrencies, but watch the hacking and regulatory trends for cryptocurrencies because that's what will likely tell us if this pullback is temporary or the start of a downward trend.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640537/bitcoin-bubble-bursting.jpg',)",none

More people are jumping into cryptocurrency, many because of how easy it's become to trade the digital assets, a CNBC/Momentive Invest in You survey found. More than 10% of those surveyed said they're invested in cryptocurrency, ranking the digital coins fourth after real estate, stocks, mutual funds and bonds. Some 65% of those cryptocurrency investors jumped into the asset class in the last year, according to the survey. In the same timeframe, the prices of some of the top cryptocurrencies have displayed trademark volatility. Bitcoin, for example, surged to an all-time high of more than $63,000 in April, slumped afterwards and then recently rallied again to nearly $50,000. Among those who do trade cryptocurrencies, the top reasons cited are that it's easy to make trades, it's exciting to invest in and there's potential for high growth in a short period of time, according to the survey.

""There are a lot of things that make crypto very attractive; the biggest one is the opportunity to make a lot of money,"" said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York. Education is key Of course, there is still risk associated with investing in cryptocurrency, as there is with any other asset. The space may be exciting and cool, said Boneparth, ""but it doesn't change the fact that you're still putting risk on your money."" For people who are interested in jumping in, experts recommend that they first do their research on cryptocurrency to make sure they really understand what they're buying. More from Invest in You:

Chesnot/Getty Images

Investment in cryptocurrency funds and products brought in $21 million last week, said CoinShares.

Solana drew in $7.1 million, the largest amount among all digital assets.

Solana's price has been on a tear, more than doubling in August.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Investment in crypto products and funds snapped six weeks of outflows by drawing $21 million last week, led by Solana, the token on the high-speed blockchain network that's seen its value double in August alone.

Solana was the standout cryptocurrency last week as inflows of $7.1 million outpaced that of other digital assets, said CoinShares, a digital asset management company in a weekly update published Monday.

Solana is widely regarded as a competitor to Ethereum, a blockchain platform on which so-called smart contracts are built. Solana's price jumped by 75% to $78.72 in a seven-day run ended August 20, and during Monday's session, it marked a 105% surge from the end of July.

The altcoin has been attracting attention following capital inflows into a number of projects based on Solana's blockchain. Solana is home to Serum, a decentralized exchange founded by crypto-billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.

Crypto funds are now carrying $57.3 billion in total assets under management, the highest amount since mid-May, a reflection of positive price action and an indication of improved investor sentiment, said CoinShares.

Ethereum, whose token is ether, logged ""minor"" inflows of $3.2 million last week, and Cardano brought in $6.4 million.

Bitcoin was the most traded cryptocurrency, and had outflows of $2.8 million, the seventh consecutive week of outflows that matched the longest run since January 2018. ""While this may suggest sentiment remains negative, it masks very mixed flows across providers,"" said CoinShares.

Bitcoin traded above $50,000 on Monday, surpassing that price on Sunday for the first time since May 15.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/6110f1d638aff7001890788f?format=jpeg',)",none

For Tanja Vidovic, it was a moment of panic: She had received a series of alerts about someone changing access to her cryptocurrency account. And she realized, as she stared at her computer screen, that nearly all of her $168,000 in holdings was gone — vanished before her eyes. She was stunned. Nearly four months have passed, and it has yet to sink in, she said. Tanja and Jared Vidovic jumped into cryptocurrency investing in 2017 and watched their funds nearly quadruple over four years. The Vidovics used Coinbase, the country's largest cryptocurrency exchange, for their plunge into the virtual currency. On exchanges such as Coinbase, users can deposit U.S. dollars and trade them for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, which the couple purchased. ""I looked into Coinbase, and it seemed like it was one that everybody used and trusted,"" Tanja said. The growing investment was a welcome boon for the Safety Harbor, Florida, couple and their three children. But in late April, Tanja, a firefighter, opened her computer to a barrage of security alerts and password change notifications. ""I signed onto the crypto. And I said, 'It's gone,'"" Tanja said. The Vidovics said they tried to contact Coinbase but they couldn't get anybody on the phone. Interviews with Coinbase customers around the country and a review of thousands of complaints reveal a pattern of account takeovers, where users see money suddenly vanish from their account, followed by poor customer service from Coinbase that made those users feel left hanging and angry. Making the issue even worse, cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reversed, according to the FBI. Experts say once criminals access an account, funds can be drained in minutes. Coinbase, which went public in April, has a market cap of about $65 billion, has more than 68 million users in 100-plus countries, more than 2,100 full-time employees and $223 billion in held assets, according to the company.

""Hopefully, Coinbase going public and having its direct listing is going to be viewed as kind of a landmark moment for the crypto space,"" CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC in April, when the company went public. ""People no longer need to be scared of it like in the early days."" While the cryptocurrency exchange company has grown rapidly, complaints have continued to arise. Since 2016, Coinbase users have filed more than 11,000 complaints against Coinbase with the Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, mostly related to customer service. Former employees told CNBC the company's customer service practices shifted over time, with representatives struggling to keep up with demand.

Money vanished

The Vidovics' account had risen to $168,596 on April 28 when the hacking occurred, according to account statements the Vidovics shared with CNBC. That amount was essentially wiped out, with only a $587.15 balance shown the next day.

Like the Vidovics, Ben, a Virginia resident who asked that his last name be withheld, said he saw thousands of dollars vanish. He logged onto his Coinbase app in March, verifying his identity with two-factor authentication, but over a four-minute stretch almost $35,000 in various coins disappeared from his account, he said. In a response to his frantic email, Coinbase told Ben his computer had been hacked and there wasn't anything the company could do. ""I really am baffled,"" he said. ""It just seems to me that Coinbase did absolutely zero research and just said, 'Hey, yeah, sorry.'"" The CFPB responded to one of Ben's ensuing complaints with an answer from Coinbase's Regulatory Response Team. The email noted that transactions on the blockchain are irrevocable and said Coinbase's insurance policy does not cover theft from individual accounts. ""There is no credible or supportable evidence that the compromise of your login credentials was the fault of Coinbase,"" the message said. ""As a result, Coinbase is unable to reimburse you for your alleged losses."" Eventually, the company sent a $200 credit, telling Ben, ""your Coinbase experience and your wait for a response to your formal complaint was not up to our standards."" Experts say SIM swapping, where fraudsters seize control of a victim's phone number and SIM card through their phone company, is to blame for many of the cryptocurrency thefts. ""The problem with SIM swapping and cryptocurrency is the moment you lose access to your cell phone, professional hackers will steal all of your money in less than 30 minutes,"" said David Silver, an attorney who focuses on cryptocurrency.

Silver, whose firm represents the Vidovics, said the top complaints from potential clients are getting locked out of their cryptocurrency exchange platform account and SIM swaps. ""Most people who contact me would tell you it's poor customer service,"" Silver said. ""They're being almost victimized twice. Because they themselves have almost no ability to contact Coinbase and deal with them directly, they're forced to retain professionals."" Etay Maor, senior director of security strategy for cybersecurity company Cato Networks, said he's seen cybercriminals on the dark web discussing how to break into accounts, including those of Coinbase users. Once hackers break into Coinbase accounts, they put them up for sale on the dark web, according to Maor. He said while credit cards sell for a few dollars, hacked Coinbase accounts can sell for $100 to $150. ""These exchanges have to invest heavily, invest in security if they want to take it seriously, just like the banks have done and have learned the hard way,"" Maor said. Account takeovers are on law enforcement's radar. ""When the attacker withdraws those funds from the exchange, that's not a transaction that you can take back,"" Ali Comolli, a management and program analyst at the FBI, told CNBC.

Comolli said the FBI tries to help victims of account takeovers recover their stolen money. ""It's obviously a huge impact on the victims, which is incredibly difficult for them,"" Comolli said. After a review of Coinbase's complaints, the Better Business Bureau in March determined the company has a ""pattern of complaints from customers who state they are locked out of their accounts, even after providing required information or updates."" The organization has received 1,128 complaints in the past three years, according to its website. BBB said it sent a letter to Coinbase in order to address the customers' complaints and receive feedback from any implemented improvements. The group has ""not heard a response from this business, about the situation, pattern of complaints for the last three years,"" Alma Galvan, a marketing and communication manager with the organization, said in an email to CNBC. Some customers with lost funds turn to social media to seek help from Coinbase or find community with other disgruntled users. Members of a 941-person Facebook group called ""Coinbase Corruption/Scandal Awareness Group"" update the page with their struggles to recoup money and accounts. One poster referred to the group as a ""sad party,"" and several have brainstormed new places to report their complaints and new methods to pressure Coinbase into making them whole. Complaints abound on Reddit and Twitter as well, where the company's support accounts often publicly reply to the messages, sometimes writing that they have ""escalated"" the issue to an appropriate team. The Coinbase Support account on Twitter also posts live updates about changes and temporary errors on the exchange platform.

Struggling to keep pace

As the company has scaled into its massive size, customer service practices have changed, former Coinbase employees told CNBC. In Coinbase's early years, employees spoke with customers through a live help chat. Jason Rose, who worked part-time in customer service at Coinbase from 2014 until 2016, said many customers asked for reassurance about cryptocurrency. ""They need that touch of somebody being there while they're going through this complex transaction,"" he said. When Rose worked at Coinbase, he said live chat acted as a sort of ""release valve"" for complaints, particularly helpful in moments of crypto volatility. As the company grew, Rose said, his role changed. Coinbase started a repository of answers to frequently asked questions in order to automate its customer service. Rose said when he left in 2016 Coinbase was starting to phase out live chat. ""The decision to do that was disastrous because the time that it took to respond back to emails took a lot longer than it would for a live chat. So, we went back to the email box, taking five days to complete a problem that could have been solved in a few minutes,"" he said. Jacques Reulet also fielded customer issues and said it was hard to keep up. ""We were very diligent about making sure that everyone who wrote in got a response, but things were getting a little unresponsive towards the end [of my time there],"" said Reulet, who worked in operations and compliance at Coinbase from 2014 to 2015. ""The sheer scale at which the company was growing was a lot to handle. I didn't see that we were keeping up."" On Jan. 15, Coinbase acknowledged that many new and existing customers are experiencing delays in their response time. ""We recognize this is frustrating. This is not the experience we want for you, our customers,"" said Casper Sorensen, vice president of customer experience, in a blog post. A July blog post announced the company's intent to roll out live chat messaging and phone support this year, as well as to expand its customer support team. The customer service issue also came up on an earnings call earlier this month. ""So proud to report that we are doing much better [with customer service], but there's always more to do,"" said CEO Armstrong. ""We've increased the headcount five times or so since January, beginning of this year, working on support specifically."" Coinbase, which declined repeated requests from CNBC for an on-camera interview, instead said in an email, ""Over the years, we've consistently updated our customer support offerings to help us scale. In early 2020, we moved to email as our primary channel of support. Many of our customer inquiries require our agents to conduct a significant amount of research to resolve the issue. And, to avoid long wait times, communicating asynchronously via email was the preferred method. However, we recognize that customers want real-time support, and that's why we're rolling out phone support for ATOs this month and live messaging for all customers later this year."" Asked about the number of customer service complaints, the company said: ""Over the past several years, our customer base grew exponentially. We grew from 43+ million users at the end of 2020 to 68+ million registered users, as of June 30, 2021. Through all this growth, some of our customers unfortunately experienced challenges and delays reaching our support team, which resulted in a negative impact for some of our customers. Improving our customer experience remains a top priority for Coinbase."" The company would not disclose how many customers' accounts have been taken over by fraudsters or the total amount it has refunded customers as a result of hacks. It added that since customers have a two-factor authentication, at the minimum, to access their accounts, only ""a small number (less than .01%) of our customers have been impacted by account takeovers."" Marci Preble, a California-based marketer, said Coinbase did credit her account the approximate amount of her original investment. But she said that was after months of a nightmare of what seemed like endless emails.

Poly Network, a platform in the decentralized finance or ""DeFi"" space, was hit by a major attack this month which saw the hacker, or hackers, steal more than $600 million worth of digital tokens. The thief exploited a vulnerability in Poly Network's code which allowed them to transfer the funds to their own accounts.

In a strange twist, the Poly Network hacker didn't run off with the haul. Instead, they opened a dialogue with the organization that was targeted, promising to return all the funds. And, sure enough, the hacker gave back nearly all of the money — with the exception of $33 million of tether, or USDT, which was frozen by its issuers.

There was a catch, however. More than $200 million of assets was trapped in an account that required passwords from both Poly Network and the hacker. For some time, the hacker refused to hand over their password, simply saying they would only do so once ""everyone is ready.""

Poly Network pleaded with the hacker, which it is calling ""Mr. White Hat,"" to return the remaining funds. The platform promised to grant the unidentified person a $500,000 bounty for helping it identify a flaw in its systems, and even offered them a job as ""chief security advisor.""

Now, the hacker has finally given Poly Network access to the final tranche of stolen funds. In a blog post Monday, the firm said Mr. White Hat shared the so-called private key needed to regain control of the remaining assets.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929924-1629309517996-gettyimages-959428194-bs_4561.jpeg?v=1629309551',)",none

PayPal launches crypto buying and selling in the UK



PayPal Holdings Inc will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week, the company said on Monday. The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class. With over 403 million active accounts globally, the company is one of the largest mainstream financial companies to offer consumers access to cryptocurrencies. It launched crypto buying and selling in the US in early 2021 and enabled customers to use their digital coin holdings to shop at the millions of merchants on its network. Read details here.

""We uncovered several findings that illustrate a seismic shift in financial services resulting from the evolution of blockchain-based digital assets,"" consultants led by Linda Pawczuk at the accountancy company Deloitte wrote alongside a report that found 76% of finance professionals think bitcoin and crypto could serve as an alternative to or replacement for fiat currencies in the next five to 10 years.

A strong majority (81%) of the almost 1,300 executives questioned think blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, is broadly scalable and has already achieved mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, 73% think their company should adopt crypto and blockchain or risk losing competitive advantage.

""The foundation of banking has been fundamentally outlived and financial services industry players must redefine themselves and find innovative ways to create economic growth in the future of money,"" Pawczuk, who heads up Deloitte's global blockchain and digital assets practice, said in a statement alongside the report.

This year, Wall Street banks from Goldman Sachs GS to JPMorgan JPM have begun rolling out bitcoin and crypto services to their clients as central banks around the world experiment with blockchain-based central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

The cryptocurrency traded at roughly $49,400 by the afternoon session, still shy of its all-time high above $64,000 set in April.

The space has seen a boost in the past week on increasing adoption. PayPal said Monday it would open its platform in the U.K. to crypto buying and selling, and Coinbase said last week that it would buy $500 million in cryptocurrency on its balance sheet.

Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Capital, is a bitcoin bull but remains wary of jumping in right here.

""I think it needs to be in your portfolio, but is $50,000 the place to be buying it? I wouldn't chase it,"" Baruch told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Monday.

Bitcoin fell below $30,000 during a summer sell-off. Weakness in recent months was largely tied to a regulatory crackdown in China wherein some mining operations were forced to close. Since a June low of $28,600, it has rallied 73%.

In a separate email to CNBC, Baruch said he owns bitcoin but began to trim his holdings once it bounced back to $45,000 — roughly the same level as its 200-day moving average and a 50% retracement level measured from its April peak and its June low. He said that level could prove a good entry point if bitcoin falls back to it.

""Again, I think it's a great space to be in, but don't chase it just because you see $50,000 in the headlines. Pick your spots and stick to your game plan,"" he said.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106898939-16239476502021-06-17t162640z_286660568_rc2g2o9bp75h_rtrmadp_0_cryto-currency-usa-politics.jpeg?v=1629754707',)",none

The Japanese Liquid exchange reported the unfolding events in a series of tweets.

The company revealed the wallet addresses which were used by the hacker to steal the funds, and temporarily froze all activity on the exchange while assessing the extent of the hack’s impact.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX) and Ripple (XRP) were the main assets targeted in the theft.

Coin mixers that randomly pool and clean cryptocurrencies in a non-custodial fashion have been used by the hackers to get away with almost half the stolen assets. According to chain data, 6,000 Ethereum (ETH) worth a staggering $20m has already been cycled through mixers into new anonymous wallets.

Uniswap was the decentralised platform used to swap ERC20 tokens stolen in the heist for more liquid Ether.

Authorities are working to recover the remaining 9,600 ETH which the hacker is yet to move from their wallet. The Japanese exchange remains hopeful the Ether valued at $32m can be recovered.

Progress was made over the weekend according to updates from Liquid on its corporate blog, the company further announced that it had already significantly ramped up network security to ensure protections against future robberies by crypto gangsters.

A wake up call for the industry

Paolo Ardoino, the Chief Technical Officer at the Bitfinex derivatives exchange, pointed to the latest hack as a wake up call for the industry. Using the event as an opportunity to suggest a more unified approach with exchanges and trading platforms working together to increase security measures in crypto.

“Today’s hack at the Liquid exchange is the latest security breach in the digital token space,” he said.

Story continues

“This is another warning, if one were needed, to everyone.

“The ingenuity of bad actors seeking to breach the security systems of exchanges and trading platforms will not abate. It is therefore imperative that we work together as an industry with all exchanges remaining in a perpetual state of vigilance against such threats.

“While the safeguarding of customer funds is of course an exchange’s number one priority, holders of cryptocurrencies should take all steps necessary to ensure that their funds are safe.

“These include ensuring that they have a cold wallet, two factor authentication, notification messages when funds are withdrawn, and avoiding public WiFi.”

LONDON — PayPal is launching its cryptocurrency service in the U.K. The U.S. online payments giant said Monday it would let British customers buy, hold and sell digital currencies, starting this week. It marks the the first international expansion of PayPal's crypto product, which first launched in the U.S. in October last year. ""It has been doing really well in the U.S.,"" Jose Fernandez da Ponte, PayPal's general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies, told CNBC. ""We expect it's going to do well in the U.K."" PayPal's crypto feature lets customers buy or sell bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum or litecoin with as little as £1. Users can also track crypto prices in real-time, and find educational content on the market. Like the U.S. version of the product, PayPal is relying on Paxos, a New York-regulated digital currency company, to enable crypto buying and selling in the U.K. PayPal said it has engaged with relevant U.K. regulators to launch the service.

A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's financial services watchdog, was not immediately available for comment on the announcement.

Growing adoption

PayPal's crypto service is similar to one from U.K. fintech firm Revolut. As is the case with Revolut, PayPal users can't move their crypto holdings outside the app. Although Revolut recently started testing a feature that lets users withdraw bitcoin to their own personal wallets. PayPal says its foray into crypto is about making it easier for people to participate in the market. ""The tokens and coins have been around for a while but you had to be a relatively sophisticated user to be able to access that,"" da Ponte said. ""Having that on a platform like ours makes a really good entry point."" The payments processor is one of many large companies taking a leap into the mostly unregulated world of cryptocurrencies. Despite ongoing concerns about price volatility, consumer protection and potential money laundering in the industry, major firms including Mastercard, Tesla and Facebook have been warming to crypto lately.

Bitcoin, the world's biggest digital currency, hit a record high of nearly $65,000 in April before tumbling below $30,000 in July as Chinese regulators extended a crackdown on the market. It has since recovered to a price of over $50,000. While PayPal started with crypto trading, the company is betting digital currencies will take a greater role in e-commerce in the long run. Earlier this year, PayPal started letting U.S. consumers use crypto to pay at millions of its online merchants globally. The firm also expanded crypto buying and selling to Venmo, its popular mobile wallet. ""We definitely have ambitions to continue to expand the product range in the U.S., the U.K. and other markets,"" da Ponte said. ""We are very deliberate about starting with initial functionality, and then we'll see where the market is going to take us. Different markets have different appetite for products.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929876-1629304059932-Pay_Pal-26.jpg?v=1629306031',)",none

It's been a good few days for bitcoin investors. The digital token is trading at nearly $50,000, its highest point in months. And many people who've stayed on the sidelines are probably wondering yet again: Is it time to buy the cryptocurrency? Before you put your money into the still highly volatile asset, however, there are three helpful things to consider, according to financial and behavioral experts.

1. Suspecting it's a bubble won't save you

Many investors know what a bubble is: It's what happens when an asset's price far exceeds its real value. And many smart people have expressed concern that bitcoin is a bubble. Still, many have invested in the currency with little caution despite their suspicions that its price is unmoored from its value.

It's common for people to buy assets even when they know they're overvalued, ""because they expect prices to go even higher,"" said Bruce Mizrach, an economics professor at Rutgers University's Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences. And, he said, ""they all believe that they can exit before the bubble crashes."" Just remember: That's what everyone else is thinking. ""By the time most individual investors get into a rising investment, it's often too late,"" said Kent Baker, a finance professor at American University.

2. FOMO often backfires

Stories of crypto-millionaires. People buying houses, thanks to bitcoin. How could you not be experiencing a fear of missing out? Investors often fall prey to the social bias of ""herding,"" Baker said. They do what the crowd does, believing that everyone else must know more than they do and that there's safety in numbers. We can't all lose our all money, they may think.

""Generally, such investors are wrong on both counts,"" Baker said. In reality, the other people ""in the crowd,"" are similarly swayed by the same illusions.

It's no secret that Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, loves bitcoin. He has touted it as the most important project in his lifetime to work on, and Square, his digital payments company, bought over $170 million worth of bitcoin earlier this year. Now, the billionaire CEO is mining it, too. ""I'm trying mining with @compass_mining,"" Dorsey tweeted on Tuesday. Compass Mining is a service that hosts, supplies and operates cryptocurrency mining rigs for individual miners who do not want to worry about purchasing and maintaining mining equipment themselves. Bitcoin operates on a proof of work model, where miners must compete to solve complex puzzles in order to validate transactions. The process isn't easy: It requires a lot of energy and computer power, which isn't cheap. The computers themselves, along with other equipment, can also be very expensive.

2. Robinhood says dogecoin accounted for 62% of crypto revenue in Q2

In its first earnings report since its IPO last month, Robinhood said that cryptocurrency accounted for more than half of all transaction-based sales in the second quarter. Dogecoin, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that started as a joke, accounted for 62% of its crypto revenue, Robinhood reported. In total, its revenue from crypto transactions was $233 million in the second quarter.

3. Coinbase is buying $500 million in crypto on its balance sheet

On Thursday, Coinbase announced it is buying $500 million in crypto on its balance sheet and will allocate 10% of its quarterly profits into a crypto assets portfolio. Coinbase plans to invest in ""Ethereum, proof of stake assets, DeFi tokens, and many other crypto assets supported for trading on our platform,"" company finance chief Alesia Haas said in a blog post.

4. The world’s second-largest stablecoin is changing its makeup

In a blog post on Sunday, Centre, the consortium that developed stablecoin USD Coin, announced it's changing the makeup of its reserves once again. This time, its reserves will consist of cash and U.S. Treasury bonds. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are supposed to be pegged to reserve assets like fiat currency. While the developers behind USD Coin previously said it was backed 1:1 by cash, it was revealed in July that cash made up just over 60% of its reserves. The other 40% was backed by debt securities and bonds. USD Coin is the second-largest stablecoin, with $27 billion worth of coins in circulation.

5. Hacker behind $600 million crypto heist returns all stolen funds

Poly Network, a decentralized finance, or DeFi, platform was hacked earlier this month, with over $600 million worth of crypto stolen. The hacker exploited a vulnerability in the platform's code, which allowed them to transfer the stolen funds. But as of Monday, Poly Network has recovered all of the stolen funds. ""At this point, all the user assets that were transferred out during the incident have been fully recovered,"" Poly Network said a blog post on Monday. ""We are in the process of returning full asset control to users as swiftly as possible."" The person claiming to be the hacker said the theft was simply done ""for fun.""

2021-08-22,The Economic Times,Will cryptocurrency ever be accepted as a ‘good’ asset class?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/will-cryptocurrency-ever-be-accepted-as-a-good-asset-class/articleshow/85554912.cms,"MUMBAI: The birth of cryptocurrency in 2008 was based on the thought that one day it could act as a common monetary system that would help replace the inefficiencies of the current centralised system around the world.The idea of an internet cash system, built on the then nascent blockchain technology, hoped to allow people to transact with each other without a third-party to verify it, like in a central bank. The peer-to-peer system, born in the midst of the global financial crisis, solved problems that troubled cryptographers since 1992.Fast forward to 2021. Today, more people see cryptocurrencies as a tool for investment rather than a currency. In fact, the view that a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin could become a widely accepted currency is now confined to just Bitcoin maximalists.In India, where cryptocurrency adoption is rising fast, businesses involved in the space are breaking away from the ideas of Satoshi Nakamoto — the pseudonym of the person who developed Bitcoin — to paint cryptocurrencies as an asset class. They are trying to convince the government and the monetary authority against banning this form of digital cash.“There is a big misunderstanding… you can’t have Bitcoin (a deflationary asset) compete with the rupee (an inflationary monetary system),” crypto exchange WazirX’s CEO Nischal Shetty had said in February at the ETMarkets Conclave. “You can’t use Bitcoin for everyday transactions because of its high cost.”But does a cryptocurrency even have the attributes to be a “good” asset class?“Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West. This asset class is rife with fraud, scams and abuse in certain applications. There is a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced and complete information,” US Securities Exchange Commission head Gary Gensler said at a recent event.An asset class is defined as a group of instruments that have similar characteristics and are governed by the same regulations.According to Chakri Lokapriya of TCG Asset Management, a good asset class should have liquidity, stability, value and a low transaction cost. “An asset class that can display stability in most of those characteristics can be termed as a ‘good asset class!’” Lokapriya told ETMarkets.com.Even the most ardent supporters of cryptocurrencies have found it hard to deal with the inherent volatility of these instruments. Cryptocurrencies are often prone to flash crashes that could be due to a number of factors, such as a sudden exit of one large investor or systemic failures at cryptocurrency exchanges.While Bitcoin’s liquidity has improved markedly due to the introduction of bite-size coins called Satoshis, others remain vulnerable to sudden bouts of liquidity drying up. A major concern among cryptocurrency investors has been the large holdings among so-called whale investors, whose exit can create market crashes. Market risk, therefore, is one of the biggest vulnerabilities of owning cryptocurrencies.High transaction costs of trading in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies is another factor that works against the asset class. Back in April, the average fee of transacting in Bitcoin was at an all-time high of $59 after China’s crackdown on the country's Bitcoin miners. High transaction fee is also one of the major arguments used by traditional investors to discard cryptocurrencies’ utility as a medium of exchange.Bitcoin’s high transaction fee also emits from the high cost of energy that miners face to keep their mining farms running 24 hours a day. According to some reports, the amount of power used to mine Bitcoin is more than the electricity consumption of Argentina.As for cryptocurrencies’ role as a store of value, the jury is still out. While a Bitcoin today is worth Rs. 36 lakh, many still doubt its ability to act as a stable store of value because of the high volatility associated with it. Bitcoin has been equated with digital gold given that its supply is scarce by design.Sceptics such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb say the true value of Bitcoin is zero. The author and risk analyst said in June that Bitcoin can neither be a short-term or long-term store of value, cannot operate as a reliable hedge against inflation, and “worst of all, does not constitute, not even remotely, a tail protection vehicle for catastrophic episodes”.Yet, many institutional investors and Fortune 500 companies are adopting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a hedge against their expectations of high future inflation as well as black swan events like the Covid-19 pandemic. Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy have already converted part or all of their balance sheet cash into Bitcoin. Recently, a Texas-based biotech company converted its cash into Bitcoin to avoid “overreach from banks”.Technical factors aside, one of the biggest hurdles in accepting cryptocurrencies as a good asset class is because of the regulatory uncertainty. The US SEC has already demanded powers from the Congress to regulate both crypto tokens and the entire decentralised finance framework. In India, crypto investors and crypto entrepreneurs want the government to regulate the industry so as to allow innovation to thrive and address misgivings about the asset’s role in money laundering, fraud and terrorism financing.Wealth managers and advisors speak of high networth investors willing to invest in cryptocurrencies through the right channels but unable to do so out of fear of prosecution.In some countries, regulators have shown a willingness to regulate cryptocurrencies as an asset class and allow asset management companies to launch instruments such as exchange-traded funds, crypto-backed bonds and the likes that provide access to common investors in a risk-controlled environment.Perhaps, among the many problems that cryptocurrencies have to tackle to be acknowledged as a good and viable asset class, regulation could be the first step in the journey.With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman suggesting a more calibrated approach to cryptocurrencies in the proposed cryptocurrency law, investors will hope the death of a utopian-style currency will give birth to the foundation of a stable asset class.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85554970,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76298,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,Euronews,Could Cardano’s 'green' cryptocurrency ADA take over Bitcoin and Ethereum?,https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/23/could-cardano-s-green-cryptocurrency-ada-take-over-bitcoin-and-etherium,"The little known cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) has come out of nowhere to become the third-largest after Bitcoin and Ethereum following a recent price surge as blockchain enthusiasts look for more climate-friendly options.

Cardano’s price has gone up by more than 36 per cent in the last week and its market capitalisation stands at $90.60 billion (€76 billion), according to crypto website CoinMarketCap.

What is Cardano and what are the reasons for its success? Here’s everything you need to know.

What is Cardano?

Cardano is a blockchain platform and it has its own internal cryptocurrency called ADA.

The tokens are named after Augusta ""Ada"" King, or Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century British countess known for her work on a theoretical computation engine. She is largely regarded as the first computer programmer and is the daughter of the poet Lord Byron.

ADA is named after 'Ada lovelace', a 19th-century British countess known for her work on a theoretical computation engine. Cardano website

Cardano was established in 2015 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and was launched in 2017. Since then, the token has returned 7,080 per cent to investors.

Cardano is the largest cryptocurrency to use a proof of stake blockchain model, which is considered a greener alternative.

As crypto enthusiasts become more aware of the environmental impact of cryptos, Cardano has an upper hand over Bitcoin and Ethereum, and this could be one reason for its recent success.

Recent figures from Bitcoinenergyconsumption.com show Bitcoin’s estimated annual emissions is over 57 million tonnes of CO2 per year, which is about the same annual carbon footprint as a small European country.

Meanwhile, Iran and China temporarily banned all crypto mining this summer because computers used in the process were sapping too much electricity and causing power cuts.

Proof of stake works by randomly allocating coins to users, who put up coins for collateral. This differs from the proof of work mechanism - used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum - which requires a global network of computers to run at the same time when a transaction takes place.

This method is designed to encourage increased computing effort for transactions, which uses much more energy than proof of stake.

On its website, Cardano says: ""We have changed science. We have changed what it means to build global systems and sustainable models of exchange and governance.

""We, alongside our community and partners, are defining a new future: a decentralised future without intermediaries, in which power is returned to the individual"".

What are the reasons for Cardano’s success?

Over the last two weeks, the cryptocurrency market has been rallying. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been leading the wave but 'altcoins' - alternative digital currencies to Bitcoin - have also gathered pace in the price race.

Cardano’s price surge came after it announced a major upgrade called Alonzo, which will launch in September.

Alonzo will introduce smart contracts to the blockchain. Smart contracts are programmes stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They are typically used to automate the execution of an agreement and will allow Cardano to deploy their own smart contracts and pave the way for its own decentralised applications (dApps).

Another reason for Cardano’s surge is that from August 25, its coin will be listed on Japan’s exchange after authorisation by the country, which is considered to have one of the strictest criteria for entering the market.

It means Cardano’s ADA will join the elite coins of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin in Japan where it will be put to the test.","('https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/00/50/90/1000x563_cmsv2_510d29c0-64e7-5c4d-9e5e-80b8de1361ed-6005090.jpg',)",none

CAS is the native coin of the Cashaa platform, which offers functions such as speedy processing, discounted set up fees, cheaper international wire cost, rebate in exchange and transaction fees.

Cashaa aims to help crypto businesses access banking infrastructure, and the neo-bank has started rolling out personal accounts across the globe, starting with India.

For this, the neo-bank has tied up with Polygon to reduce the ethereum network fee, which is becoming a bottleneck for small transactions on the network, while at the same time for the enhanced security provided by the network.

Using the bridge, CAS holders will be able to leverage Polygon’s full-stack scaling to minimize transaction fees while transacting with CAS and gain access to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem. Moreover, CAS holders will also be able to stake CAS on the Polygon network to earn up to 30% annually, which will be rewarded in CAS and MATIC tokens.

Matic, is the native currency of Polygon (formerly Matic Network), which was co-founded in 2017 by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun.

“Cashaa has been continuously scaling and now entering into giving personal accounts to increase the adoption of its CAS token, which requires cheaper transaction cost. Association with Polygon is another step towards the same,"" said Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO, Cashaa.

Cashaa will be implementing MATIC tokens in the following products: Cashaa Earn, which earns up to 14% annual interest on deposits; Cashaa Lend, a loan solution of 0% interest rates on cryptocurrency-collateralized fiat loans on bitcoin, Cashaa, ether and matic.

In the last two years, Cashaa has onboarded more than 250 crypto-native businesses who transacted over $1 billion using the Cashaa solution.

2021-08-22,The Guardian,PayPal to allow UK users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/23/paypal-uk-buy-sell-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-ethereum-litecoin,"PayPal is to allow users in the UK to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies through the payment platform for the first time.

The firm said it would allow customers to choose from four types of cryptocurrency – bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash – and that the service would be available via the PayPal app and its website.

A crypto tab will be added to the platform, showing real-time currency prices as well as offering educational content to help answer common questions and learn more about cryptocurrencies, including the potential risks, PayPal said.

The payment company said it hoped that the move to embrace the currency would help improve knowledge and understanding of it.

Cryptocurrencies remain controversial because of their lack of regulation and volatile value fluctuations, and some critics have raised concerns about the anonymity offered to users as part of transactions, arguing the currencies are used by cybercriminals to hide their activities.

Jose Fernandez da Ponte, the vice-president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said the firm’s service could help introduce more people to the technology and how it works, helping to better shape the role the currencies could play in the future.

“The pandemic has accelerated digital change and innovation across all aspects of our lives, including the digitisation of money and greater consumer adoption of digital financial services,” he said.

“Our global reach, digital payments expertise, and knowledge of consumer and businesses, combined with rigorous security and compliance controls provides us the unique opportunity, and the responsibility, to help people in the UK to explore cryptocurrency.

“We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce.”

PayPal confirmed the service would begin rolling out this week and would be available to all eligible customers within the next few weeks.

The firm has launched a similar service in the US, which allows users to make purchases at participating businesses using cryptocurrencies – a feature that has not yet been confirmed for release in the UK.

Laith Khalaf, the head of investment analysis at the financial firm AJ Bell, said he expected the service to be added in the UK at some point soon.

Khalaf said there were signs investors were “leapfrogging traditional forms of savings and diving in at the deep end by investing in crypto”, and that the City regulator was concerned about the potential for consumer harm posed by volatile pricing.

“An alarming statistic is that 14% of UK crypto buyers funded their purchases using debt, according to figures released by the FCA in June. While many are no doubt using crypto as a bit of harmless fun with small amounts of money they can afford to lose, some consumers are at risk of getting sucked in and spat out by the crypto craze,” he said.

“PayPal’s presence is positive in that it is a high-profile, publicly listed company, which is already subject to regulatory scrutiny. But overall the crypto craze remains a worry for consumer advocates and regulators.”","('https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc3755117074a7ad081b2f74a3d5223732e973c/0_300_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=60b96ea8c4342dd260580796b02553dd',)",none

In a press release dated August 19, Bitcoin Suisse announced the integrated service named WL Crypto Payments. This omni-channel payment solution will allow all merchants using the Worldline payment services to accept payments in Bitcoin and Ether. The merchants will be able to accept payments in Bitcoin and Ether on point-of-sale (POS) and e-commerce services.

To use this payment service, merchants only need to download the WL Crypto Payments mobile app. They can also install the Worldline payment plugin for their online store.

Clients willing to pay through digital coins may use the mobile cryptocurrency wallet application for this purpose. Prices displayed in Swiss Francs (CHF) will be shown in real-time Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) value, according to the options that a client chooses. The price, to be paid in cryptocurrency, can get confirmed to the merchant instantly.

The transaction is claimed to be safe from volatility risks, as it will be securely converted into CHF after payment is confirmed.

This payment solution was successfully tested in a pilot programme before being rolled out to all Worldline merchants in Switzerland. Worldline and Bitcoin Suisse first collaborated over crypto payments in November 2019.

According to a 2019 press release, the companies intended to reinforce the ""leading position of Switzerland as a strong center in the crypto-financial services industry."" Switzerland houses over 800 companies that offer services or develop solutions for crypto and blockchain companies and is a bustling hub of cryptocurrency growth.

Worldline Switzerland MD Marc Schluep said that this project stood up to their goal of bringing “tangible value to merchants across the globe and to facilitate smooth and modern payments in all the markets"" the firm operates in.

Bitcoin Suisse CEO Dr. Arthur Vayloyan called it a “historic milestone for crypto adoption in Switzerland and beyond,” and added that this step proved yet again that Switzerland was the leader in collaborative innovation and a pioneer in the crypto and blockchain industry.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_ether_stock_unsplash_1629707389109.jpg',)",none

At the current price of $2.82, Cardano’s market capitalisation stands $90.60 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Its price has gone up by nearly 11.3 percent in the last 24 hours. Its year to date is also much higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum as it is currently at 1,444 percent.

The cryptocurrency market has been rallying in the last two weeks with the total market capital surging past $2 trillion. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been leading after they plummeted in mid May. Meanwhile, new altcoins have also rallied in the price race.

Cardano is a proof of stake blockchain and is considered a direct rival of Ethereum and Solana. Its recent price surge came after the upcoming ‘Alonzo’ upgrade was recently announced.

The update which will be launched in September is expected to introduce smart contracts to the blockchain. “It's an important moment, marking significant progress in the rollout of #smartcontracts on the #Cardano mainnet which is targeted for the end of August/early September,” the development team said in a Twitter post adding that it has begun test net as well.

The bullish trend of Cardano got a boost after the coin was authorised to list in Japan which is considered to have one of the ‘most demanding listing criteria worldwide’. It is scheduled to be listed on August 25, 2021. This listing places the native among the likes of elite coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin that are also traded on the Japanese exchange.

Cardano’s reputation as a “green coin” is what attracts cryptocurrency enthusiasts who want to engage with environmentally friendly and sustainable digital assets.

The most popular cryptocurrency has been trading in the green with a market cap of more than $921 billion.With 76 lakh users, WazirX has witnessed a massive 2,648 per cent growth in user signups from tier 2 and 3 cities in the country, observing higher participation from women from smaller towns compared to their urban counterparts.The cryptocurrency exchange has clocked $21.8 billion in overall trading volume since January 2021.'We welcome the government's move on the cryptocurrency bill and wish that cryptocurrencies will not only become available for mainstream investors but also to those who have an inclination to try the new asset class. We already have our own self-regulatory code of conduct and best practices in place for our users,' Shetty told IANS.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last week that she is awaiting an approval from the Cabinet on the bill on cryptocurrency.The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has said it may come out with a model of central bank digital currency (CBDC) as early as the end of 2021. A CBDC is a virtual currency issued by the central bank and has a sovereign backing, unlike other digital currencies.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, however, has flagged his major concerns over cryptocurrencies to the government.In its circular on April 6, 2018, the central bank had prohibited banks from dealing in cryptocurrencies or offering any such service to the customers.The circular was challenged in the Supreme Court , which set aside the rules on March 4 last year.'A digital coin by the RBI will be the key step to popularise cryptocurrencies in India,' said Shetty.'With expanding Internet access in a mobile-first country, people can start trading at ease as no bank account would be needed.

Cryptocurrency is all the rage these days, and as it usually happens, malicious apps and hackers are here to take advantage of the ongoing crypto hype. These apps are designed to mislead innocent users into installing them on their smartphones.Google has identified eight such dangerous crypto apps on the Play Store and banned them. These apps were designed to lure innocent and unsuspecting users into installing them on their phones. These apps employed the usual “ get rich quick ” scheme to lure users into investing money in a ‘cloud mining service’ and reaping profits.“Despite these apps not being associated with cloud-mining operations or having any cryptocurrency-mining features, some of these apps prompt users to pay for increased cryptocurrency-mining capabilities via the apps’ in-app billing systems that range from $14.99 to as high as $189.99,” the Trend Micro report said.According to an analysis by security firm Trend Micro, the eight banned apps forced users to watch advertisements and have an average monthly fee of $115 (approx. ₹1,114). These apps also suggested to users that they could pay for increased mining ability by buying their favourite crypto “machines” in the cloud.“The app called Daily Bitcoin Rewards – Cloud Based Mining System prompts its users to upgrade their crypto mining capacity by “buying” their favourite mining machines to earn more coins at a faster rate,"" the report further added.What’s worse is, Trend Micro says that there are over 120 fake cryptocurrency mining apps still available.

Buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency with PayPal

The introduction of this service offers customers a new way to explore cryptocurrency in the PayPal environment they know and trust. Customers can start by buying as little as £1 of cryptocurrency through PayPal. To purchase cryptocurrency, eligible customers can log into their PayPal account via the website or their mobile app, navigate to the new crypto tab to view the four cryptocurrencies available and view current pricing and trends.

Customers can choose from pre-determined purchase amounts or enter in their own purchase amount, before following the prompts to buy the cryptocurrency of their choice. Customers will be able to fund their PayPal account for the purchase using their bank account or debit card. If customers choose to sell cryptocurrency with this new service, funds are normally available quickly to spend in their PayPal account. There are no fees to hold cryptocurrency in a PayPal account. There are transaction fees and currency conversion fees for buying and selling applicable cryptocurrencies.

Create greater understanding and enable access

As part of this offering, PayPal provides account holders with educational content to help them understand the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the volatility, risks, and opportunities related to purchasing cryptocurrency. The company encourages its customers to do their research on the risks and opportunities for various cryptocurrencies before taking the step to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency with PayPal.

Advancing the next generation of financial services infrastructure

PayPal is one of the largest companies globally to enter the market for digital currencies with its announcement last October that it would allow its millions of U.S. customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies. This March, the company announced 'Checkout with Crypto'— enabling customers in the U.S. to use their cryptocurrency alongside other payment methods in their PayPal wallet to make purchases at businesses around the world. In April, the company introduced crypto services on its mobile payment service Venmo in the U.S.

In addition to providing these cryptocurrency services, PayPal has been exploring the potential of digital currencies through partnerships with licensed and regulated cryptocurrency platforms and with central banks around the world. For the past five years, PayPal has increased its focus on, and invested resources in its internal blockchain research team to explore the next generation of digital financial services infrastructure and enhancements to digital commerce.

The company has enabled its cryptocurrency offering through a partnership with Paxos Trust Company. PayPal's venture capital arm has also made investments in blockchain and cryptocurrency-related start-ups including: TRM Labs, leading cryptocurrency risk management software; TaxBit, a provider of crypto tax software to customers and exchanges; and Talos, institutional-grade infrastructure technology for digital asset trading.

2021-08-22,NDTV.com,Why Is Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance Facing Intense Scrutiny Around The World?,https://www.ndtv.com/business/why-is-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance-facing-intense-scrutiny-around-the-world-2515125,"Leading banking institutions and payment processors in the UK have begun to limit Binance transfers

Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, has suspended futures and derivatives products offerings across Europe, starting with Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Announcing the move, it said it was “taking proactive steps” towards harmonising crypto regulations. The move meant Binance users from these countries were prohibited from opening new futures or derivatives products accounts. But why exactly it took such a drastic step in an important, growing market? And Why is it facing intense regulatory pressure and scrutiny around the world?

Some countries have banned it and others have curtailed its operation. Many others have warned it to cease its “illegal” operations on their territories. Even in India, Binance-owned WazirX is under the radar of the Enforcement Directorate for alleged money laundering. The ED is probing allegations that Chinese-operated betting apps laundered a portion of funds through WazirX. The Indian exchange, however, said it is in compliance with all applicable laws.

Additionally, leading banking institutions and payment processors in the UK have begun to limit transfers to and from Binance because of “excessively high fraud rates”. The company is also said to be preparing to cut daily withdrawal limits from two Bitcoin to 0.06 BTC this month. Despite recent efforts to appease regulators, Binance was forced to cease trading and support for stock tokens like Tesla and Coinbase.

Earlier this year, the Thailand SEC filed a criminal complaint against Binance, while the Cayman Islands stated that the exchange was not allowed to conduct operations there. And the latest to raise a red flag over its operations is the Dutch central bank, saying the company was found not in compliance with the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws. Binance is also being scrutinised by the US Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service.

There are some questions about Finance as well. For example, It's not clear where the company is based. Its corporate structure is also surrounded by mystery, though it is led by a Canadian, Changpeng Zhao, known simply as ""CZ"". A Binance spokesperson has said the company is ""decentralised"" and it ""works with a number of regulated entities around the world"".","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/bfh7lu3g_binance_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,Sky News,"PayPal to let UK users buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies",https://news.sky.com/story/paypal-to-let-uk-users-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies-12388151,"Online payment company PayPal is to allow users in the UK to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies using its platform.

Available on both its app and website, the service will initially be limited to four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.

It comes after the launch of the same service in the US which was then followed by a Checkout with Crypto feature, enabling PayPal users to actually spend their crypto when making purchases with online merchants.

The volatility and lack of regulation around cryptocurrencies, which are considered private money under English law, has often been seen as an impediment to their adoption by large payment companies such as PayPal.

Critics have often flagged how the potential anonymity offered by using crypto online has empowered cyber criminals and fraudsters operating on the internet.

Jose Fernandez da Ponte, vice president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said his company's new service could help introduce more people to cryptocurrency.

""The pandemic has accelerated digital change and innovation across all aspects of our lives, including the digitisation of money and greater consumer adoption of digital financial services.

""Our global reach, digital payments expertise, and knowledge of consumer and businesses, combined with rigorous security and compliance controls provides us the unique opportunity, and the responsibility, to help people in the UK to explore cryptocurrency.

""We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce.""

PayPal said the new service would begin to be available this week and all eligible customers should be able to access it through a new cryptocurrency tab within the next few weeks.

It is not clear if and when the company will allow consumers in the UK to pay merchants using cryptocurrency.

PayPal hopes its service can address concerns about the volatility of the cryptocurrency by the settling the transaction in fiat cash, meaning merchants won't have to accept the risk themselves.

The company said it will not charge a transaction fee for people using a cryptocurrency at checkout, and that only one type of coin could be used with each purchase.","('https://e3.365dm.com/21/03/1600x900/skynews-paypal-building-hq_5323846.jpg?20210330110050',)",none
2021-08-22,NDTV Gadgets 360,"How Secure Is the Bitcoin Blockchain, and Is Your Cryptocurrency Safe?",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/how-secure-is-bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-technology-2516405,"People often ask if Bitcoin is a safe investment not because of the market's legendary volatility, but because they're worried about the security of the digital asset. Bitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world and has been around since 2009. Since then, in over a decade, the network has proven to be very resilient and powerful in protecting vital information. In recent years, the blockchain technology that Bitcoin runs on has become increasingly prevalent as cryptocurrency has begun to take center stage in many markets.

Blockchain technology that runs the virtual currency is known for its unparalleled security. It's one of the main reasons for its rapid adoption, with Bitcoin being one of the biggest success stories of the technology.

What is blockchain technology and how does it work?

Blockchain is associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, as a platform for digital money transactions. It's a database of all cryptocurrency transactions worldwide. However, this technology has also been used to store other types of data like medical records, data on humanitarian aid, and more.

Blockchain technology is like a ledger that is digital and open to the public. It provides a secure way of making and recording transactions. All transactions made using cryptocurrency are recorded and saved as data on blocks. All this information is time-stamped.

Is blockchain technology safe?

The easiest way to understand blockchain technology is to remember it as a series of blocks that store data. Each of the blocks holds a unique hash number and a link that connects it to the previous block. Every block is an important part of the sequence and it cannot be changed. If there is any change, the hash sum would alter and the block would longer be valid. This invariability is the foundation of blockchain' security along with three other aspects that we will look into below:

Cryptography

All blockchain transactions are secured by cryptography. Each block contains essentially a unique and private key that can be verified with a public key. If there is a change in transaction-related data, the block unique key becomes invalid. As a result, the block is discarded from the chain.

Decentralisation

Blockchain technology is secure as it is decentralised and distributed. There is no single point of failure, which makes it much harder to corrupt. Hacking into one part of the system cannot affect other parts. However, in the case of a private blockchain, this advantage is partially lost as they have a single point of control and a limited number of nodes. This restricts users from making changes to the ledger. Organisations operate these kinds of blockchains for their internal use, as it allows the company to control its own processes.

Consensus

All blockchain technology operates through a consensus model, which verifies that a transaction has taken place and legitimises it. Most consensus models run on protocols that include proof of work, proof of stake, proof of authority, etc.

What makes the Bitcoin blockchain safe?

The cryptographic system makes transactions irreversible — in other words, a block once created on the chain cannot be modified. However, you can add information to it. This restricts people from being able to reverse any transaction that has already taken place.

The Bitcoin blockchain is public. While the words transparency and public do not sound safe, in the case of Bitcoin it is. Despite the anonymity of the user, all transactions on the network are accessible to the public, making it difficult to hack or cheat the system.

It is decentralised. The Bitcoin network is distributed and has thousands of nodes all over the world that keep track of all transactions happening on the system. This ensures that in case something goes wrong on one server, there are others to pick up the slack. Hacking into any one server is pointless.

This is not to say that it is foolproof or impossible to hack — but it certainly isn't easy either. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, you're more likely to suffer losses from bad investing, or be tricked into giving up your coins, than to have them hacked away from you.","('https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-04/bitcoin-reuters_650x400_61524105890.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,Analytics Insight,Best Cryptocurrency Mining Pools for Beginners in 2021,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/best-cryptocurrency-mining-pools-for-beginners-in-2021/,"Best Cryptocurrency Mining Pools for Beginners in 2021

Here’s an alternate way to invest in the cryptocurrency market.

Cryptocurrency has become a hot investment option and everyone is gearing up to bank on popular crypto coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, XRP, and Litecoin. While these digital tokens can be purchased from several trading platforms and exchanges, cryptocurrency mining pools are also an alternative to create cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency mining pools are groups that are operated by third parties to manage hash power from miners globally. These cryptocurrency dashboards have dashboards that can be understood by beginners and experienced miners.

How to Choose the Right Mining Pool?

Some basic criteria to look for are reputation, pool fee, uptime efficiency, location, support, and UI panel. A popular pool is often reliable and secure. Every cryptocurrency pool will require you to pay mining fees, hence it is best to opt for pools that have a high payout and low fees. Like cryptocurrencies, selecting the right mining pool also requires research. No matter where you are in the world, you should be able to operate the mining functions. Make sure to choose a pool that runs on a server that can be used globally as the response time of the device depends on it. As a beginner, facing issues with the network is common. If a pool has good support and feedback system, your queries will be solved quickly without losing precious time to mine cryptocurrencies.

Following these points, here are some of the most reliable cryptocurrency mining pools for beginners.

1. Slush Pool

Slush Pool is the oldest mining pool in existence, going a decade back to 2010. It’s a publicly available active mining pool and has a reputation for being stable and accurate. It has a smooth sign-up process and you can also create a demo miner to understand how the dashboard works. The website has two settings, one for beginners and one for experienced miners. Slush Pool also offers many features like preferences, device choice, and remote monitoring.

2. ViaBTC

ViaBTC supports many cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Dash. The services go beyond the mining pool as ViaBTC has related products like ViaWallet and cryptocurrency exchanges. With a global presence, ViaBTC offers stable payouts for miners and offers higher payouts.

3. AntPool

AntPool is the biggest mining pool in the world. It mines about 11% of all blocks and the servers work around the world. AntPool boasts an innovative peer-to-peer mining protocol that can link your device to the one that is the nearest during setup for a reliable connection.

4. BTC.com

If you are familiar with Bitcoin.com, BTC.com is owned by the same company. Before starting the mining section, BTC.com was known for its innovative Bitcoin wallet and its blockchain explorer. Mining in many geographies like Germany and the US, BTC.com has a medium-sized mining pool that supports many cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Ether, and more.

5. KanoPool

Functioning since 2014, KanoPool is a smaller pool comparatively but has low mining fees and an easy setup process. Registration is optional and the only requirement is a BTC wallet address and a username. The layout is simple, user-friendly, and has a detailed help page that has all the important FAQ answers.

6. Binance Pool

Binance Pool is powered by the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. After the success of its exchange platform and its native token Binance coin, Binance Pool is an upcoming popular platform that mines about 9% of all blocks, currently.

7. F2pool

The logic behind F2pool is that a user can contribute computing power to discover blocks. It is one of the best bitcoin mining pools and can be used for trading Bitcoins as well. F2pool supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and offers live chat support.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency-Mining-Pools.jpg',)",none

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, reached as high as $50,152.24, the highest since mid-May, up 2.5%.

Bitcoin has recovered after trading in a range of about $30,000 to $40,000 for many weeks, after it plunged from a record near $65,000 in mid-April. Still, it’s up significantly in the past year.

As per CoinDesk, Ether, the coin linked to ethereum blockchain and the second largest crypto, surged to $3,321. Dogecoin, on the other hand, was trading at $0.32, up 1%. Other digital coins like Stellar, Uniswap, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano also were trading with gains over the last 24 hours.

The worldwide crypto adoption grew by 880% between June 2020 and July 2021, according to the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain data platform Chainalysis. India ranks second in terms of crypto adoption worldwide behind Vietnam, but ahead of countries such as the US, UK, and China, as per the report.

Before the rebound over the past few weeks, the crypto sector had been weighed down by a crackdown in China and worries over the environmental impact of the energy needed to create coins and process transactions. Supportive comments from billionaire Elon Musk and Ark Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood had helped Bitcoin rally.

In another news, PayPal Holdings Inc will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week. The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class, reported Reuters.

The total market value of cryptocurrencies was at $2.17 trillion on Sunday, according to data from CoinGecko.com, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The overall value has been helped in the past seven days by the 18% rally in Cardano and Binance Coin’s 11% gain, while Dogecoin is up about 9% over the period and Solana 73%, CoinGecko pricing showed.

Bitcoin's price hover around $50,000

Cryptocurrency prices continue to be in the red on August 23. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $2.13 trillion, a 1.37 percent increase over the last day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $93.71 billion, which makes a 13.09 percent decrease.

2021-08-22,NDTV Gadgets 360,"What Are Cryptocurrencies? Making Sense of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ether, and the Rest",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/opinion/what-are-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-dogecoin-ether-2514871,"To understand cryptocurrency, you need to understand how money works, and what makes these new assets useful, and potentially also usable as currency in the future. First, there was ""physical"" money - notes and coins. Then came e-Money - the numbers that show in your e-banking apps. Both these are issued by the Government.

And then came cryptocurrency, a type of electronic money that is not issued by any Government. It is also called Math Money because it is created and managed using blockchains which are computer networks powered by advanced mathematics. Today, the use case for cryptocurrency is mostly its value as an asset, while the underlying blockchain technology is already powering a number of applications. But the future of money could look very different.

1. What is blockchain?

Let's say Svetlana borrows 10,000 Rupees from me. She is supposed to return it in a week but doesn't. I remind her but she has conveniently ""forgotten"" about it. What can I do? Nothing, except never lending her anything ever again! True story.

Now suppose, at the time of lending the money, a few friends are present. They all clicked a pic or shot a video of me lending Svetlana the money and her promising to return it in a week. And each of these friends posts the pic/ video on Instagram, Facebook, etc. Now that is solid evidence. And Svetlana can't really delete all these videos/ pics from the Internet.

Now that's something like a blockchain.

A blockchain is typically a bunch of computers (nodes) connected to each other. All of these computers contain the same information (e.g. a ledger of transactions). To ""hack"" this information, you will need to ""hack"" most of these computers at the same time. And that's a pretty tough thing to do!

There are many blockchains in the world. The Bitcoin Blockchain is the first and oldest one. It records all transactions of the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Anyone can run a node of this blockchain. All you need is a computer with enough storage space and a strong Internet connection.

2. How are cryptocurrencies created?

There are 2 common ways of creating crypto-currencies. One is the style used by Bitcoin and the other is the style used by Ethereum.

In the Bitcoin-style, there are a bunch of computers called miners who are constantly trying to solve mathematical puzzles. Roughly every 10 minutes, one of these miners wins this race to solve the puzzle. This miner wins a reward which is currently 6.25 bitcoins. That's about Rs. 2 crores. Yes, you read that right. Every 10 minutes there is someone getting 2 Crores worth of bitcoin.

But don't get too jealous of these miners. They have to spend tons of money on computers and electricity. And they can never be sure how much they will actually end up earning.

Many years ago anyone could mine or create bitcoins using a laptop! Well, not anymore. Today you need a ton of computing power for this. In case you want to understand this concept of mining in all its complicated tech glory, you can download the free Future Money Playbook that I have written.

In the Ethereum-style, you can create your own crypto in minutes. My daughters were quite fed up hearing about Dogecoin. So they decided to create their own cat-based cryptocurrency. All they needed to do was customize a ""smart contract"" and publish it to the Ethereum blockchain. That's it! In a few minutes, they had created a new cryptocurrency with a supply of 7 billion tokens - one for each human on Earth. True story.

3. What are the types of cryptocurrencies?

There are 3 common types of cryptos - medium of exchange, utility coin, and stablecoins.

A medium of exchange crypto can be used to buy and sell stuff. Examples are Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Monero. These are the types that Governments hate. That's because they can be used by criminals. But hey, criminals can also use cash! So it's a little unfair to blame these poor little cryptos.

Then there are utility coins. Just like oil ""fuels"" the global economy, utility coins, like Ether, ""fuel"" blockchain-based businesses.

And finally, there are stablecoins. These are backed by normal fiat currencies like the US dollar or the Japanese Yen.

4. Numbers don't lie

The world's first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin (BTC). It is a medium of exchange crypto with a total worth of more than $880 billion. And the world's largest bank, JP Morgan Chase is worth $470 billion.

The world's most popular utility coin is Ether (ETH) with a total worth of $377 billion. India's largest bank, HDFC Bank, pales in comparison with a total worth of $140.37 billion.

Tether (USDT) is the most popular stablecoin with a total worth of $64 billion. Doesn't seem much? Well, that's also the size of ICICI Bank!

That does not mean a user or investor gets an automatic update about each successful transaction. It's more like the data is stored and updated on the digital ledger but anyone who wants to check details has to look for it. But how do you do that? That is done with the help of tools that work as a sort of “Google” for cryptocurrency.

What about cross-platform data? Meaning if a Bitcoin blockchain user wants to check the details of a transaction related to, say, the Ethereum blockchain, how to do it? That can also be done by the same process. These tools are called blockchain explorers. Most of them provide services for more than one blockchain.

What are blockchain explorers?

Simply put, a blockchain explorer is a type of software that pulls data from a blockchain and creates a database for users to search for particular information from the available resource. They allow users to see details related to various cryptocurrency transactions, including the amount transacted, the source and the destination of the transfers, and the status of transactions.

A user can provide searchable terms and the explorer will throw up the results in a table form of all matching transactions.

A blockchain explorer allows for the exploration of data of recently mined blocks or transactions. They also allow a user to do the following:

Explore the transaction history of any wallet address, improving transparency on a blockchain.

The latest transactions in a blockchain and the amounts transacted.

Explore receiving addresses and change addresses. During a transaction, a specified amount is sent to the intended address and the remainder of the fund in the sending address is sent to a “change” address. The change is not available to spend until the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain network.

Explore the largest transaction of the day. The Whale Alert [https://whale-alert.io/] website is an example of this.

Explore mempool status. The mempool is where all the valid transactions wait to be confirmed by the network. This gives the details of unconfirmed transactions.

Helps users see fees paid for transactions, blockchain difficulty, hash rate, and other data.

Why use a blockchain explorer?

A blockchain wallet provides some data but it is limited in details and reach. An explorer, on the other hand, can provide data related to transactions carried out on all wallets on a blockchain. A major benefit of using explorers is they help maintain transparency.

Explorers allow users to check balance and expenditure on smart contract addresses, for checking if a wallet address is valid to a blockchain before sending crypto coins to it. They also help in checking whether the transaction has reached the intended recipient and see what went wrong if the transaction has not gone through. Explorers also give information about the cost of a transaction. As research tools, explorers help users in making important decisions on transactions and investments.

Blockchain explorer examples

One of the earliest blockchain explorers are blockexplorer.com. Since then, several such tools have been developed. Some of them are blockchain.com — now blockchain.org — along with blockchair, tokenview, and etherscan. Most of the available blockchain explorers cover a majority of blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Cryptocurrency_coins_Reuters_main_1629671903930.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,NDTV Gadgets 360,Cryptocurrency Predictions: What Is Pivot Point and How Is It Calculated,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/pivot-point-calculator-cryptocurrency-predictions-market-trends-trading-bull-bear-2516330,"There is no dearth of technical terms in cryptocurrency trading. One of the reasons for this is the relatively new nature of the market. However, in many ways, trading in cryptocurrency is similar to trading in equities or stocks. Both are speculative with a varying degree of risks and investors in both markets often depend on their reading of a few parameters to gauge the overall trend. One of these parameters is pivot points. Investors calculate these points based on the high, low, and closing prices of previous trading sessions to see whether they should stop or double down on their investments.

What are pivot points?

A pivot point is found through technical analysis and is an indicator of the overall trend of the market. It is simply the average of the high, low, and closing prices from the previous trading day or session. If the market the next day runs above the pivot point, it is considered that the market is showing bullish sentiment. If not, it could be time to stop and rethink your investment strategy.

When pivot points are combined with other technical tools, they throw up a broad picture about an asset, as well as the support and resistance levels during a short-term trading session.

How are pivot points calculated?

Pivot points can be calculated in several ways. But the most common of them is a five-point system. This method uses the previous session's high, low, and close data — along with two support levels and two resistance levels. Using these price points, a pivot point is calculated. The equation for calculating a pivot point is given below.

Pivot Point = (Previous High + Previous Low + Previous Close) divided by 3

The equation to calculate support levels is:

Support 1 = (Pivot Point x 2) − Previous High

Support 2 = Pivot Point − (Previous High − Previous Low)

To find the resistance levels, use this equation:

Resistance 1 = (Pivot Point x 2) − Previous Low

Resistance 2 = Pivot Point + (Previous High − Previous Low)

These results are used to plot a course for five levels: two resistance levels, two support levels, and a pivot point. Collectively, the method is known as the five-point system. This system allows traders to define an area where the price seems most sensitive and is likely to cause a shift in the market sentiment.

Time frames

The common practice is to use pivot points for smaller time frames — at most for 4-hour charts and for as small as 15-minute charts.

Types of pivot points

There are five types of pivot points. Apart from the pivot point finding method discussed above (Standard Pivot Point), there are Camarilla Pivot Point, Denmark Pivot Point, Fibonacci Pivot Point, and Woodies Pivot Point.

How are pivot points different from other indicators?

Instead of relying on the current price movement, the pivot point system makes use of the previous day/ session's price data. This approach provides traders with an early signal of the things to come so they can plan accordingly. The pivot points remain static until the start of the next trading session.

Limitations of pivot points

Experts say pivot points are suited only for intra-day trading as they are based on simple calculations and may not hold true during swing trading. Also at times, volatile price movements can completely disregard pivot point predictions. When volatility is high, experts say it's best not to depend on pivot points as price fluctuations are rapid and wide for any predetermined calculation strategy.","('https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Market_crash_Reuters_1621501462274.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,Reuters,PayPal launches crypto buying and selling in the UK,https://www.reuters.com/technology/paypal-launches-crypto-buying-selling-uk-2021-08-22/,"LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) will allow customers in the UK to buy, sell and hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies starting this week, the company said on Monday.

The roll-out, which marks the first international expansion of PayPal's cryptocurrencies services outside of the United States, could inspire further mainstream adoption of the new asset class.

With over 403 million active accounts globally, the San Jose, California-based company is one of the largest mainstream financial companies to offer consumers access to cryptocurrencies.

PayPal launched cryptocurrency buying and selling in the United States early this year, later enabling customers to use their digital coin holdings to shop at the millions of merchants on its network.

The company hoped its foray into the new asset class would encourage global use of virtual coins and prepare its network for new digital currencies that may be developed by corporations and central banks.

""We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support— and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role

digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce,"" Jose Fernandez da Ponte, vice president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said in a statement.

In the UK, PayPal's service will rival that of established cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O), as well as well fintech startups such as Revolut.

Customers will be able to buy bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash through their PayPal wallets online or on the mobile app.

The move comes as more established financial companies have started offering their clients, both consumers and institutions, access to digital assets, amid rising cryptocurrency prices.

2021-08-22,Cointelegraph,"Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, ADA, AVAX, CAKE, ATOM",https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-ada-avax-cake-atom,"Bitcoin (BTC) is knocking at the doors of the key $50,000 level, and most traders are still optimistic, even after the digital asset rallied 70% from the July 20 low at $29,278 to an intraday high at $49,757.04 on Aug. 21.

Monitoring resource Material Indicators pointed to a lot of puts at the $50,000 strike price and the “positive funding almost across the board (overheated),” which suggests a rejection at the current levels and a “pullback going into September.”

Nikita Ovchinnik, chief business development officer of 1inch Network, said that several new institutional investors began adding exposure to crypto in the past year, and that “They didn't come for short-term gains.”

Another positive sign for the crypto sector is the ever-growing list of unicorns. Analysts expect more companies to join the list as the adoption of crypto and blockchain increases.

Will Bitcoin’s hesitation near the $50,000 mark shift the focus to altcoins? Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that are likely to attract traders' attention in the short term.

BTC/USDT

Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded off the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($45,049) on Aug. 19, and the bulls pushed the price above the stiff overhead resistance at $48,144 on Aug. 20. The bears are currently attempting to stall the up-move at the psychological resistance at $50,000.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bulls do not give up much ground and flip the $48,144 level to support, it will indicate strength. The BTC/USDT pair could then pick up momentum and start its northward march toward $58,000.

The rising 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

Alternatively, if bears pull the price below $48,144, the pair could drop to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) ($45,816). This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could embolden the bears.

The sellers will then try to sink the price below the breakout level at $42,451.67. If they succeed, it will suggest the start of a deeper correction.

The four-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the zone between $49,500 and $50,000. If they can sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $46,600 and then to $44,000.

If that happens, it will suggest that the bulls are losing their grip and the pair could then remain range-bound between $44,000 and $50,000 for a few days. The bears will have to pull the price below $42,451.67 to gain the upper hand.

ADA/USDT

Cardano (ADA) is in a strong uptrend. The bulls pushed the price above the all-time high at $2.47 on Aug. 20, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick showed selling at higher levels. The altcoin formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on Aug. 21, indicating indecision among bulls and bears.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The uncertainty resolved to the upside on Aug. 23 as the bulls have again pushed the price to a new all-time high. If buyers sustain the price above the breakout level at $2.47, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $3.

However, the long wick on the Aug. 23 candlestick suggests that bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They will try to pull the price back below $2.36 and trap the aggressive bulls. If that happens, the pair may correct to $2.20.

If the price rebounds off $2.20, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. A breakout and close above $2.47 to $2.65 will enhance the prospects of the continuation of the uptrend. Alternatively, a break below $2.20 could pull the price down to $1.94.

The four-hour chart shows that the 20-day EMA is sloping up but the RSI is forming a negative divergence. This suggests that the bullish momentum may be slowing down. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA.

Contrary to this assumption, if bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest strength. That could attract further buying, and the pair may then rally to the psychological resistance at $3.

AVAX/USDT

Avalanche (AVAX) rallied from $18.41 on Aug. 17 to $50.27 on Aug. 21, a 173% rally within a short time. This sharp up-move has pushed the RSI above 92, indicating the rally is over-extended in the short term.

AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The long wick on the Aug. 21 candlestick shows that bears are attempting to defend the psychological resistance at $50. On the downside, the first support is at $40. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that bulls are not booking profits aggressively, as they anticipate the rally to continue further.

A breakout and close above $44 could improve the prospects of a retest of the all-time high at $60.30.

On the contrary, if bears pull the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $38.09, the AVAX/USDT pair could correct to the 50% retracement level at $34.34. A break below this support will indicate that the bullish momentum may have weakened.

The four-hour chart shows that bears are attempting to stall the relief rally at the overhead resistance at $44.60 and the bulls are buying on dips to $40. This suggests that the pair could remain range-bound between these two levels in the short term.

If the bulls drive the price above $44.60, the pair could rally to $50.27. A breakout and close above this level will signal the resumption of the uptrend. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate that traders are booking profits and not buying the dips. That could signal the start of a deeper correction.

CAKE/USDT

PancakeSwap (CAKE) is currently in a strong recovery. Sustained buying by the bulls pushed the price above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $22.74 on Aug. 20.

CAKE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bulls sustain the price above $22.74, the relief rally could reach the 50% retracement level at $26.85 and then the 61.8% retracement level at $30.96. The bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance in this zone.

On the way down, the critical support to watch out for is the 20-day EMA ($20.37). If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest that sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA could open the doors for a further decline to $16.

The four-hour chart shows the price is trading inside a rising wedge pattern. If bears sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to the support line of the wedge. This level is likely to act as strong support, and a sharp rebound off it will indicate that traders are buying on dips.

A breakout and close above $24.65 will suggest the resumption of the up-move. The next target objective on the upside is the resistance line of the wedge. The bullish momentum could pick up if bulls thrust the price above the wedge.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) had been trading in a large range between $8.51 and $17.56 since late May. The bulls pushed the price above the resistance of the range on Aug. 18, clearing the path for a possible move to the pattern target at $26.61.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the long wick on the Aug. 23 candlestick and the RSI above 83 suggest the rally is overextended in the short term. This could attract profit-booking by the bulls, resulting in a minor correction or consolidation in the next few days.

If bulls do not give up much ground and flip the $17.56 level into support, the ATOM/USDT pair will again try to resume the uptrend. A break above $26.61 could open the doors for a rally to $28 and then to $30.

The bears will have to pull and sustain the price below $17 to invalidate the bullish sentiment.

The four-hour chart shows that bears are mounting a stiff resistance near $24. Although bulls had pushed the price above this resistance, they could not sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.

A positive sign is that buyers are not dumping their positions in a hurry. The pair could consolidate between $21 and $24 for some time. A breakout and close above $24 will indicate strength and signal the resumption of the up-move.

Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate the start of a deeper correction to $17.56.

2021-08-22,CNN,"For the crypto world, bipartisan infrastructure package brings a 'political awakening'",https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/22/politics/crypto-political-awakening-infrastructure-package/index.html,"Washington, DC (CNN) Members of the cryptocurrency world are donating to crypto-focused organizations, hiring lobbyists and ramping up advocacy efforts in a push to get lawmakers on board with the industry, as pressure builds on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to address a cryptocurrency provision of the bipartisan infrastructure bill before a vote in the House.

""The crypto world has been made politically aware,"" said Anne Fauvre-Willis, chief operating officer at Oasis Labs, a blockchain privacy company. ""For many there has been a personal political awakening.""

The push follows a back-and-forth debate between Senators and dueling amendment proposals earlier this month that would have modified language included in the bipartisan infrastructure package meant to regulate cryptocurrency -- which uses blockchain technology for online transactions.

Despite the debate, a cryptocurrency language compromise amendment failed before final passage of the legislation in the chamber Tuesday, leaving crypto advocates concerned for the fate of an industry they are personally invested in and care deeply about.

As it stands, the provision would impose more federal regulation on cryptocurrencies and could dramatically expand the number of cryptocurrency users who would have to report filings to the Internal Revenue Service -- something that has struck a nerve with supporters of an industry designed to take out intermediaries and grant autonomy to its users via a decentralized system.

While a small number of advocates with cryptocurrency think tanks and associations have been making noise in DC for years, leaders in the crypto space told CNN that the recent debate over cryptocurrency regulations on Capitol Hill caught the attention of thousands of people who were previously disengaged from politics.

""There is a whole new swath of people paying attention to what's happening in Washington,"" said Ryan Selkis, founder of Messari, a cryptocurrency research and analysis firm.

Like Fauvre-Willis, Selkis told CNN the conversation around cryptocurrency in DC prompted an ""awakening for many people.""

The birth of the 'crypto voter'

Since early August, the phrase ""I am now a single issue voter,"" has gone viral among crypto circles on Twitter, flooding the feeds of both high profile crypto leaders and ordinary traders who have racked up thousands of likes and hundreds of retweets for sharing that they will only vote for candidates supportive of the booming industry.

Selkis' own Twitter bio reads, ""single issue voter: anti-crypto politicians should be afraid.""

But according to members of the crypto community, while ""crypto voters"" may prioritize protecting the booming industry, they don't yet belong to one party or the other.

For her part, Evan Greer, who for the past decade has organized large-scale online protests in support of net neutrality and in opposition of internet censorship and government surveillance, said that in her experience, ""Tech issues often fall outside of the historical Democrat vs. Republican partisan divide.""

""These are fundamental issues, about how people orient toward institutions of power whether that's corporate power or government power,"" Greer -- director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights nonprofit -- told CNN.

""Among young folks especially, there is skyrocketing skepticism about arbitrary forms of power, either from the government or corporations, and we see that play out in the crypto community,"" Greer said. ""The traditional left-right party politics that have dominated US politics for young people are really starting to erode.""

Push to protect crypto industry goes beyond social media

Earlier this month, 25 new companies have expressed interest in joining the Blockchain Association -- a trade association with 46 existing member companies that works to educate lawmakers on and improve public policy around cryptocurrency.

""This is a pivotal moment for the crypto ecosystem because it was the first time that so many people have in a unified way reached out to the Senate [and lawmakers] and let them know this is a super vibrant, super creative group,"" said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.

In recent months, the Blockchain Association beefed up its lobbying operation, Smith, who has been with the association for three years, told CNN. The group has an internal Republican lobbyist, internal Democratic lobbyist and three lobbying firms on retainer.

Smith, who is also registered to lobby, told CNN that member companies are now hiring lobbyists or lobbying firms too.

Asked why those unfamiliar with the crypto space may care about the recent cryptocurrency advocacy push, Smith said it comes down to a belief in the benefit of having autonomy over one's financial transactions.

""Even if you don't understand the tech [behind crypto], the ability to use your money and data in the way that you want to use it and to have a digital life where you're not at the mercy of intermediaries is something that should be attractive to a lot of people,"" she said.

Coin Center, a think tank started in 2014 that focuses on cryptocurrency policy, has seen ""a surge"" in donations both from individuals and corporations, Neeraj Agrawal, the organization's director of communications, told CNN.

Since August 1, the organization has received gifts from more than 350 individual donors, he said.

And Fight for the Future -- which directed more than 40,000 people to their online portal to call to Senators earlier this month, urging the lawmakers to scale back the proposed cryptocurrency regulations -- has since received more than $20,000 in donations to their organization, mostly given in cryptocurrency.

Creators and users of cryptocurrency, ""have now woken up to the fact that government can kick down your door and shut down your cool project,"" Greer said.

""Any lawmaker that wants to get support from young voters needs to show they aren't utterly ignorant about these issues,"" Greer said.

Fight for the Future will use the donations to support the push to protect crypto in the infrastructure bill, which is moving toward the House of Representatives, Greer said.

The organization will launch a ""full court press"" operation, Greer said, requesting meetings with lawmakers, driving more phone calls and emails to legislators and creating educational videos and explainers.

""All of that costs money,"" she said.","('https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210809123837-crypto-phone-super-tease.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,ABC News,"What to know about 'stablecoins,' the 'bridge' between cryptocurrencies and traditional money",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/stablecoins-bridge-cryptocurrencies-traditional-money/story?id=79500575,"In the exploding realm of cryptocurrencies, a new line of financial products has emerged that has caught the attention of both investors and regulators -- so-called ""stablecoins,"" which are backed by cash or another reserve asset.

Stablecoins seek to provide the best of both worlds: the stability of a traditional government-backed currency as well as the privacy and convenience offered by crypto transactions. They are often marketed towards investors who may not have the stomach for the volatility associated with Bitcoin, Ethereum and other popular cryptos -- which have been known to see-saw widely in value on a day-to-day basis.

The existing stablecoins market is worth some $113 billion, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said earlier this month during a speech at the Aspen Security Forum. He added that in July, nearly three-quarters of trading on all crypto trading platforms occurred between a stablecoin and some other token.

Even social media behemoth Facebook is trying to get in on the action, seeking to launch a stablecoin-like project of its own of its own after its initial Libra cryptocurrency efforts fizzled.

As their popularity rises, stablecoins have also recently drawn new scrutiny from authorities and regulators. Federal Reserve officials mulled over the threats posed by ""new financial arrangements such as stablecoins"" in a recent meeting, according to a readout released earlier this week, raising concerns over the lack of transparency and regulations.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last month also called on regulators to ""act quickly"" in forming new regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, raising alarms over their ""potential risks to end-users, the financial system, and national security.""

Here is what experts say investors should know about the novel class of cryptos dominating headlines in recent weeks.

What are stablecoins?

Stablecoins are essentially cryptocurrencies that are backed by a reserve asset -- usually a traditional currency such as the U.S. dollar. The valuations of stablecoins are therefore supposed to be less volatile than other digital currencies, because they are pegged directly to a fixed, non-virtual currency.

""Think of stablecoin as a cryptocurrency without, or with limited, volatility. That is the best way to think about it,"" Haran Segram, a professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business, told ABC News, adding they are sometimes looked at as ""the bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies."" Fiat currencies are traditional currencies like the dollar, backed by the government.

""Stablecoins are backed by other central bank currencies,"" Segram explained.

Bryan Routledge, an associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, added that this makes stablecoins more useful as an everyday currency.

""For example, the price of Bitcoin is just stunningly volatile,"" he told ABC News. ""That makes it harder to use as a currency."" In 2021 alone, Bitcoin's value has seen swings of 100% -- starting the year at a price of less than $30,000, reaching a peak of over $63,000 in April, before receding back to the $30,000 mark in July. As of Friday, Bitcoin was trading at a little over $46,000.

""When I tell you a latte cost $2.50, you know what that means -- but if I quote a price of a latte in Bitcoin, it's just really hard to keep track of because one day it's the equivalent of $2.50, the next day it's equivalent to $25,"" he added.

Pegging cryptocurrencies to a fixed exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar, as stablecoins attempt to do, makes them ""more useful as a currency,"" according to Routledge.

'It's a stablecoin because they call it a stablecoin'

While this may sound like an overall positive development for everyday investors interested in crypto, experts and authorities have warned of lurking risks associated with the largely unchecked stablecoin market.

Segram noted that one of the most popular stablecoins out there is Tether, which claims to be backed one-to-one to the U.S. dollar.

""The issue with that is some research was done into that, and then actually they found that one unit of that stablecoin is backed by .74 of the U.S. dollar,"" Segram said. ""So things like that, what people put out saying it's a stablecoin, it might not be truly a stablecoin.""

""That's something that investors and your audience should be aware of,"" he told ABC News. ""Because people don't know exactly what's happening in the background, and I would really encourage your readers to be aware of that.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office led an investigation into Tether that said there were periods of time when Tether did not have access to banking and ""held no reserves to back tethers in circulation at the rate of one dollar for every tether, contrary to its representations."" As part of a settlement reached with James’ office, Tether is barred from doing business with New Yorkers but admitted no wrongdoing and pledged increased transparency. The Hong Kong-based entity still maintains on its website, however, that Tether tokens are ""100% backed by Tether’s reserves"" at a conversion rate of one Tether token equaling one U.S. dollar.

""Under the terms of the settlement, we admit no wrongdoing,"" Tether said in a statement on its website in response to the investigation. ""The settlement amount we have agreed to pay to the Attorney General’s Office should be viewed as a measure of our desire to put this matter behind us and focus on our business."" The company added that it is pleased by the ""loyalty"" customers have shown, saying that the market capitalization of tethers grew from $2 billion to an excess of $34 billion during the past two years, while the investigation was ongoing.

""Tether is complicated because it's an international business,"" Routledge added in regards to who regulates it. ""Cryptocurrencies, one of their either charms or weak points, is they don't sort of fall under anybody's direct jurisdiction.""

For most stablecoins, ""it's a stablecoin because they call it a stablecoin,"" Routledge added.

Despite assurances of cash reserves, there is a risk that some stablecoins might operate under the assumption that the likelihood of having to liquidate all at once is slim if confidence remains high.

""If everybody thinks Tether is going to be a stablecoin, it will work as a stablecoin and the few people that need to exchange it at the 'Tether store,' to be colloquial, would do that,"" he said. ""The trouble with that policy is that you can get what the foreign exchange economists would call like a speculative attack, which is that we don't think Tether has enough money, and I think everybody thinks that, they're all going to show up and demand those currencies -- It's a bit like a run on the bank.""

""That's what makes it really hard to stabilize, because your credibility as a stablecoin is the thing that makes it stable, and that's inherently flighty,"" he said.

Why the Fed and Yellen are so concerned about stablecoins

Yellen's calls for quick action on creating regulatory frameworks for stablecoins have been echoed by other lawmakers.

Stablecoins were also recently debated by Fed officials, who ""highlighted the fragility and the general lack of transparency associated with stablecoins,"" at their most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. ""The importance of monitoring them closely, and the need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework to address any risks to financial stability associated with such products.""

Segram said that while stablecoins can ""regulate themselves to some extent by being transparent with the public, I think Yellen is calling for more top-down regulations rather than let it be voluntary.""

This could mean having the reserve currency kept somewhere independent, or having claims be regularly audited, he added.

Segram added that the Fed, meanwhile, might have other concerns around stablecoins' growth.

""If stablecoins become popular, the central bank loses its control,"" Segram said, noting that there have been discussions of stablecoin-like ""Central Bank Digital Currency"" to be issued by the Federal Reserve.

A Central Bank Digital Currency would give the Fed more control ""over how we manage demand, supply and all other means,"" Segram said.

Routledge added that the Fed may also have worries about a ""banking panic"" situation if a lot of assets are flowing through a specific stablecoin.

""If for whatever reason that stablecoin has a shock to it -- that can be a systemic event to the financial system,"" he added. ""That is what's on the Fed's radar.""

SEC Chair Gensler, meanwhile, signaled a regulation crackdown could be looming during his remarks earlier this month in Aspen.

Gensler said the use of stablecoins on crypto trading platforms ""may facilitate those seeking to sidestep a host of public policy goals connected to our traditional banking and financial system: anti-money laundering, tax compliance, sanctions, and the like.""

""This affects our national security, too,"" he added. Gensler said he looks forward to working with regulators and lawmakers on these matters.

Despite the risks, Segram sees cryptocurrencies as the future, which may be in part why regulators are raising alarm bells and why there is so much discussion over a potential central bank digital currency. Major U.S. companies including Amazon and Walmart have recently announced they are hiring cryptocurrency experts, and a growing number of firms have started accepting cryptos as a form of payment.

China's central bank has already launched its digital Yuan, he added, saying that the U.S. most likely will at some point in if it does not want to lose its status as the ""reserve currency of the world.""

""If a stablecoin is issued by a private authority, it is not 100% fail-proof,"" he said. ""In a democracy like ours, or other democracies where there's some political stability and currency stability, a central bank digital currency might be the way to go.""

""I think of stablecoin sort of as a link between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, this takes that to another level,"" he said.","('https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/money-illustration-rf-gty-jc-210820_1629489806353_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg',)",none

NEW DELHI: Cardano, a relatively lesser-known cryptocurrency, has raced to the top three. In its dash to the top, Cardano (ADA) has made a stunning recovery from a $1 trillion crash and occupies the third place after Bitcoin and Ethereum.Cardano’s rise to the top has happened at a time predicted to be a ‘quiet one’ by market analysts. By Friday morning, Cardano (ADA) completed the week-long run registering 10 percent growth. This in terms of crypto gains is a formidable and matchless run.Its volumes swelled on the back of a software upgrade that could help the currency to stand next to Ethereum which is only second to Bitcoin.According to Coindesk, the digital coin hit an all-time high Friday of $2.58, an increase of more than 18 percent. Year to date, it has seen returns of 1,294 per cent recording a recovery of $82 billion, in the process surpassing Binance coin and securing the third position.This unprecedented rally may again continue following the update that is expected sometime on September 12. This phase will allow smart contract functionality and for a range of decentralized finance applications to be used on the Cardano network.Smart contract functions have been the strong points of any cryptocurrency and will continue to be so, for a longer period until an alternative is found to better the trading experience and exchange.Smart contracts are a way to ensure agreements can be validated securely. Ethereum has already arrived at that point and that is said to be its biggest strength.Another upgrade is on the cards when Cardano moves into the third phase known as Goguen . Enough space has been created in this phase to include Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens.It must be recalled that Cardano was founded by the co-founder of Ethereum, Hoskinson four years ago, and if there is anybody in the world of cryptocurrency who knows the major takeaways of Ethereum vis-à-vis Cardano, it is Hoskinson.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85533972,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-301800,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

It was clearly the week of altcoins surging way past the cryptocurrency market formen Bitcoin and Ethereum to make a substantial mark. While Bitcoin ($49,235) saw a 7-day rise of 5.67 percent and Ethereum ($3,236) rose just 0.03 percent in the same time, altcoins like Cardano ($2.53) recorded a weekly jump of 17.47 percent, along with Cardano ($2.53) which spiked 17.47 percent, Polkadot ($27.72) which peaked 23.02 percent, Solana ($74.52), which rose almost 64.85 percent and Terra ($27.94), which hiked 63.44 percent.

Winds of Change

In fact, Cardano, with a current market cap of 80,559,983,767 dollars overtook Binance Coin’s market capitalization ($75,750,693,612) as the third biggest cryptocurrency after Ethereum and Bitcoin. This is mostly thanks to its upcoming Alonzo upgrade, which will incorporate smart contracts, opening a range of applications like DeFi, NFTs, automated lending, and more and giving stiff competition to peers like Ethereum.

Closer home, crypto adoption in India is exponentially growing, with the country ranking second, succeeded by Vietnam amidst the countries that make a lion’s share of cryptocurrency usage, with 9 percent of the respondents claiming to utilize cryptocurrency, per market research firm Finder.

In fact, all five leading nations in terms of bitcoin ownership are located in Asia. Bitcoin (16 percent) is the most popular coin, followed by Ethereum and Bitcoin cash (6 percent) and Ripple (8 percent). While men (32 percent) take precedence over women (23 percent) in terms of possession, young adults (32 percent) aged between 18-24 when it comes to cryptocurrency ownership. Young adults lead the way with 32% of those aged 18-24 have invested in cryptocurrency.

Regulatory woes to end?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clarified the government’s stand on cryptocurrency, stating that the area has a lot of potential in terms of fuelling the country’s fintech sector. Notably, the work on the pending cryptocurrency regulation bill is nearly complete and the cabinet will decide further, with chances of it being presented in the winter parliament session

""We cannot be moving ahead as if this doesn't exist. We are not saying no to cryptocurrency. We are saying we will have to see how this technology can help fintech to maximize the potential it has. But how sophisticated regulation can be is something which I want to work with the RBI,"" she elaborated.

The necessity of regulations in this field, however, was highlighted in the recent case of cryptocurrencies worth 97 million dollars being stolen from the digital currency wallets of Liquid, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange. In the meantime, all deposits and withdrawals on the platform have been suspended.

Furthermore, terrorist groups like ISIS have begun receiving funds in bitcoins as well, External Minister S Jaishankar said. The money flow, resource mobilization, and killing rewards to ISIL (Daesh) in Syria, Iraq, and its affiliates in Africa have increased in recent times, he explained.","('https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2021/08/cryptocurrency-770x433.jpg',)",none

Going down the memory lane, back then, the world of cryptocurrencies was considered to be fraudulent and a market that had no intrinsic value. Who knew the story would take a 360-degree turn and leave us talking about how, when, and how much to invest in cryptocurrencies, like never before? Today, the investment in cryptocurrencies is not just limited to big corporate companies but to retail investors as well. Companies taking initiatives to align their operations with the crypto industry comes as no big a surprise. This, ultimately, has become a major contributor to the ever-growing digital economy.

Though a lot of people across the globe are quite familiar with the concept of cryptocurrencies, at least to some extent, what is worth taking note of is the fact that cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies were a relatively small and sophisticated niche of the tech industry about a decade ago. Lack of understanding has always been a concern. In addition to this, the governments and financial regulatory agencies have not been that welcoming when it comes to the crypto industry. Consider – India. In India, the entire banking industry and also the companies in the jurisdiction of the Reserve Bank of India have been strictly banned from interacting with crypto technology. Though the Supreme Court had to intervene and see if the reversal of this ban could be done, there is still a lot of speculation that the government might be planning an outright ban on cryptocurrencies. But, since nothing stands certain, the companies and retail investors have got no choice but to wait till the final decision is out.

All this while, not much has been said about how the crypto industry facilitates seamless cross-border cash transfers, addresses the inflation problem, or helps in eradicating corruption. All this has paved the way for the assumption that cryptocurrencies are bad. However, the situation seems to have changed drastically. What we get to see today is the manner in which companies are exploring ways to embrace cryptocurrencies. A lot of companies and startups have come to terms with the efficiency that cryptocurrencies bring to the business. The last two years saw industry players like MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal leaving no stone unturned to embrace crypto by allowing their clients to buy crypto and engage with other crypto services like paying with crypto via their systems. On the other side, we get to see a lot of organizations taking steps to throw light on how various companies and investors can benefit from the cryptocurrency market. They have gone a step ahead by providing step-by-step tutorials on how both – individuals as well as companies can start investing in cryptocurrencies.

What has turned out to be rewarding is that a lot of the regulators have become relatively lenient. For example, in India, where the RBI had banned cryptocurrencies, speculation that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the Republic of India might be created, serves to be a ray of hope. At the global level, too, there is a positive vibe regarding the same. Companies across the globe have just realized the need to incorporate cryptocurrency and its underlying technology in their operations and are still exploring ways in which they can make the best possible use of this technology to reap maximum benefits. Hence, looking forward to seeing several companies launch different crypto-related programs, declare crypto investments in their balance sheets, and start processing crypto payments for goods and services wouldn’t be surprising at all. In the coming days, one can expect investment firms to launch more crypto-themed products and banks to broaden partnerships with reputable crypto exchanges. All in all, the crypto market has a lot to offer in the days ahead.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency.jpeg',)",none

2021-08-22,Yahoo Finance,"Ethereum Classic Stops For Gas, Along With Bitcoin And Doge, On Bullish Moon Trip",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-classic-stops-gas-along-145939300.html,"On Saturday morning Ethereum Classic (CRYPTO: ETC), along with apex cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and the ever-popular Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), was consolidating Friday’s bullish trek north. All three cryptos have recently had a relative strength index (RSI) of over 70% which puts them into overbought conditions for technical traders.

A cryptocurrency, like a stock, always enters into a period of consolidation after either a large incline or decline. Ethereum Classic rose 137% between its June 22 low of $32.17 and its Aug. 15 high of $77.37. Although bulls would love to see the original Ethereum version ‘moon’ it will need to stop for gas along the way.

The Ethereum Classic Chart: On Aug. 7 Ethereum Classic broke up from a descending trendline that had been holding the crypto down since June 3. After busting up through the trendline Ethereum Classic soared about 46% over the course of nine days.

When the crypto reached its $77 high its relative strength index measured in at 79% which was a sell signal. The crypto then retraced about 22%, which cooled its RSI down to a much more comfortable 57%, before making another bullish move up.

In its consolidation Ethereum Classic has created another descending trendline which it has now rejected on four separate trading days. For technical traders a trendline must demonstrate support or rejection at least three times to be valid. Ethereum Classic rejected from its new trendline on Aug. 15, 16 and 20 and on Saturday morning the crypto tried to jump over it but failed.

As of 10:00 a.m. ET Ethereum Classic’s trading volume was about 143 million compared to its average 10-day volume of 547 million. When a crypto or stock trades down on low volume it is usually a bullish consolidation as opposed to a bear break.

Ethereum Classic is trading over the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending above the 21-day, both of which are bullish indicators. On Saturday morning the crypto tested the eight-day as support and held above it. Ethereum Classic is also trading above the 200-day simple moving average indicating overall sentiment is bullish.

Story continues

Bulls want to see big bullish volume come in and drive Ethereum Classic up over the descending trendline. If the crypto can clear the level it has resistance above at about $72 and $79.

Bears want to see big bearish volume come in and drop the crypto down below support at the eight-day EMA. If Ethereum Classic loses the support level it could fall toward $65. Below that there is support near the $57 mark. etc_aug._21.png

2021-08-22,NDTV.com,"Here's How You Can Invest In Bitcoin, Ethereum, Other Crypto Coins In India",https://www.ndtv.com/business/crytocurrency-in-india-heres-how-you-can-invest-in-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-other-coins-in-india-2515676,"In India, some popular exchanges are WazirX, CoinDCX and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Cryptocurrency has become a lucrative financial asset for investors these days with its scope to provide steady returns, despite its volatile nature. Being a form of a digital asset, cryptocurrency is primarily based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. The decentralized structure of the virtual currency allows it to exist without the control of governments or regulation of any central authority.

Ever since billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla Inc invested in the world's largest cryptocurrency- bitcoin, leading crypto coins such as ethereum, dogecoin, and bitcoin have caught the attention of the bigger investors as well as the common man.

In India, many are still advocating the classification of cryptocurrency as an asset. Recently, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the cabinet note on the cryptocurrency bill is ready and the Cabinet is yet to clear the same. Presently, cryptocurrencies are under no regulation in the country, which often makes it risky for investors.

However, one must know the basic steps of investing in cryptocurrency. Here is how you can invest in crypto coins such as bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin in India:

Step 1: Find the right crypto exchange

Since there is no established structure for trading in cryptocurrency yet, crypto exchanges are the platforms where people can buy and sell their digital assets. In India, some of the more popular exchanges are WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber.

Step 2: Create an account

After selecting the crypto exchange for trading, create your account on the platform. After creating an account, select the amount you plan to invest, what you seek to invest. Read all policies of the platform carefully. The platform will ask for the submission of documents as proof in order to prevent any fraudulent activities.



Step 3: Set up the account for trading

One needs to have money in the account before buying cryptocurrencies. The money can be transferred from one's bank account to a particular exchange account. Upon transferring funds, make sure that both accounts are linked.

Step 4: Making the investment

After the accounts are linked and the crypto exchange account has money, one needs to select which coin they want to invest in. The world's biggest and most popular cryptocurrency is bitcoin, followed by ethereum by market cap. Other leading coins include tether, dogecoin, XRP, cardano, binance coin. After purchasing, make sure you store codes to the account, to protect it from risks such as hacking. Experts advise storing the coins purchased in a crypto wallet.



Latest prices:



On Saturday, August 21, bitcoin was last trading 3.26 per cent higher at $48,707.8 against the US dollar. Ethereum - the world's second-largest cryptocurrency was last up 1.15 per cent higher at $3,273.60 against the American currency.","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/ogfsfjs8_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,CNBC,Inside Afghanistan's cryptocurrency underground as the country plunges into turmoil,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/21/bitcoin-afghanistan-cryptocurrency-taliban-capital-flight.html,"Crypto trader and vlogger Farhan Hotak traveling to the Shah Wali Kot District in Afghanistan.

Farhan Hotak isn't your typical 22 year-old Afghan. In the last week, he helped his family of ten flee the province of Zabul in southern Afghanistan and travel 97 miles to a city on the Pakistani border. But unlike others choosing to leave the country, once his relatives were in safe hands, Hotak then turned around and came back so that he could protect his family home – and vlog to his thousands of Instagram followers about the evolving situation on the ground in Afghanistan. He has also been keeping a very close eye on his crypto portfolio on Binance, as the local currency touches record lows and nationwide bank closures make it next to impossible to withdraw cash. ""In Afghanistan, we don't have platforms like PayPal, Venmo, or Zelle, so I have to depend on other things,"" said Hotak. Afghanistan still mostly operates as a cash economy, so money in Hotak's crypto wallet won't help him put dinner on his table tonight, but it does give him peace of mind that some of his wealth is safeguarded against economic instability at home. It also offers bigger promises down the road: Access to the global economy from inside Afghanistan, certain protections against spiraling inflation, and crucially, the opportunity to make a bet on himself and a future he didn't think was possible before learning about bitcoin. ""I have very, very, very limited resources to do anything. I'm interested in the crypto world, because I have earned a lot, and I see a lot of potential in myself that I can go further,"" he said.

Run on the banks

For many Afghans, this week has laid bare the worst-case scenario for a country running on legacy financial rails: A nationwide cash shortage, closed borders, a plunging currency, and rapidly rising prices of basic goods. Many banks were forced to shutter their doors after running out of cash this week. Photos featuring hundreds of Kabul residents crowding outside branches in a futile effort to draw money from their accounts went viral.

""There's no bank I can go to right now, no ATM,"" said Ali Latifi, a journalist born and based in Kabul. ""I live above two banks and three ATM machines, but they've been off since Thursday,"" said Latifi, referring to the Thursday before the palace ouster. Without an authority helming the Central Bank, it appears that printing cash to cover the shortfall isn't an option, at least in the short-term. The Western Union has suspended all services and even the centuries-old ""hawala"" system – which facilitates cross-border transactions via a sophisticated network of money exchangers and personal contacts – for now, remains closed.

Sangar Paykhar, a Kabul native currently living in the Netherlands, has been in constant touch with relatives there in recent weeks. He said that many who live paycheck to paycheck were, at first, borrowing money from others to get by, but now, those able to lend out cash have started conserving their funds. ""They've realized the regime has collapsed"" and that those they are lending to ""might not have a job tomorrow,"" said Paykhar. A few days before the Taliban entered Kabul, Musa Ramin was among the people who queued outside a bank in a fruitless attempt to withdraw cash. But unlike other Afghans in line with him that day, months earlier, he had invested a portion of his net worth into crypto. Ramin had been burned before by a rapidly depreciating currency, and decentralized digital money had proven to be a trusted safeguard. In 2020, on what was meant to be a brief layover on a trip from London to Kabul, Ramin got stuck in Turkey. A one-week, mandatory Covid quarantine ballooned into six months. ""I converted all my money to the lira,"" he said. After the Turkish currency began to spiral, Ramin said his capital was cut in half, and he was forced to conserve it. ""That is when I discovered bitcoin."" With all flights cancelled and no other options for departure, Ramin realized he needed to find alternative ways to support himself while stranded in Turkey during the pandemic-related shutdown. That's when he started trading crypto. ""At first, I lost a lot of money,"" he said. But he's since gotten the swing of managing his digital assets, thanks to Twitter and tutorials on YouTube.

Even after returning to Kabul, the 27 year-old says he put all his focus into trading crypto. 80% of his crypto capital is in spot exposure, primarily in major coins, like bitcoin, ethereum, and binance coin. The other 20% he uses to trade futures. ""I was making more money in crypto in a month than in construction in a year,"" said Ramin, though he did acknowledge the risk that's involved. ""It's easy making money in crypto but keeping that wealth is the difficult part."" Despite that volatility, Ramin still sees crypto as the safest place to park his cash. ""If a government isn't formed quickly, we might see a Venezuela-type situation here,"" Ramin told CNBC. He feels virtual tokens are his safest hedge against political uncertainty and plans to increase his exposure to digital currencies in the coming year to as much as 40% of his total net worth.

Ramin isn't alone in his thinking. Google trends data shows that web searches in Afghanistan for ""bitcoin"" and ""crypto"" rose sharply in July just before the coup in Kabul. That said, because this tool is a measure of interest, the spike could be referring to 10 searches or it could be 100,000. But in a country that has long relied on physical cash for virtually all transactions, not many people have the option to let their savings sit in a bank account, let alone a digital wallet. Just take Hotak. He lives in a remote part of Afghanistan where there are no ATMs or bank branches nearby. That means he has to keep a lot of physical cash on hand, in order to cover daily expenses. ""Afghanistan is an unexpected country, and you have to be ready for anything,"" he said. While Hotak thinks that crypto is his future, for now, the bulk of his income comes from day labor jobs, like shoveling, brick work, digging wells, and running a tailor shop that makes clothes.



""Zabul is not a very developed city. It's a village, so that's how I earn,"" he said.

Signs of a growing crypto economy

It's hard to get insight into crypto adoption in Afghanistan. Beyond the fact that measuring cryptocurrency adoption at the grassroots level isn't easy, people actively go out of their way to hide who they are. Some Afghans, for example, will conceal their IP address by using a virtual private network, or VPN, in order to mask their geographic digital footprint. And unlike many crypto boosters – who tend to be vocal and community-driven – digital currency supporters inside Afghanistan often don't want others to know they exist. ""The crypto community in Afghanistan is very small,"" said Hotak. ""They actually don't want to meet each other."" He thinks that could change if the political situation normalizes, but ""for now, everyone just wants to stay hidden until things are nice."" However, new research from blockchain data firm Chainalysis is offering fresh optics on the country's apparently burgeoning peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto network, which is increasingly the most telling metric of adoption in Afghanistan. Hotak, as well as his friends, use Binance's P2P exchange, which allows them to buy and sell their coins directly with other users on the platform.

Chainalysis' 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index gives Afghanistan a rank of 20 out of the 154 countries it evaluated in terms of overall crypto adoption. And when you isolate for its P2P exchange trade volume, Afghanistan jumps up to seventh place. That's a big move in just 12 months: Last year, Chainalysis considered Afghanistan's crypto presence to be so minimal as to entirely exclude it from its 2020 ranking. ""Afghanistan on top makes sense from a capital controls point of view, given it's hard to move money in and out,"" explained Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst. And some experts tell CNBC that Chainalysis could actually be underestimating its overall adoption. ""Unlike many other countries, sanctioned nations don't have good and clear data on P2P markets,"" explained Sobrado. He says that is partly to do with the fact that it is harder to track those transactions.

There are other anecdotal signs of adoption across the country. Nearly a decade ago, sisters and Afghan entrepreneurs Elaha and Roya – both of whom had a focus on computer science at Herat University – founded the Digital Citizen Fund, an NGO that helps women and girls in developing countries gain access to technology. The organization has 11 women-only IT centers in Herat and another two in Kabul, where they teach 16,000 females everything from essential computer skills to blockchain technology. Before classes were suspended earlier this week, creating a crypto wallet was also part of the curriculum. Elaha Mahboob tells CNBC that some students have chosen to secure their money in crypto accounts and a few have specifically started investing in bitcoin and ethereum in order to achieve their long-term financial goals. ""This is especially important as they don't have to worry about not having access to their money, because major banks in Afghanistan have closed,"" Mahboob said. A few Digital Citizen Fund participants have left the country and used the crypto accounts they made in class as a way to transfer their money out. Afghanistan's exposure to the cryptosphere was also taking place inside the presidential palace. Blockchain company Fantom told CNBC it had been working in tandem with the previous government. One such project with the Ministry of Health involved piloting blockchain technology to track counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Fantom says the pilot ""concluded successfully,"" and they had been preparing for national rollout before the Taliban took over. Then there's Sweden-based Bitrefill, an online marketplace that helps customers live on cryptocurrency by exchanging digital coins like bitcoin or dogecoin for gift cards with partner merchants. In Afghanistan, the card offerings include multiple mobile phone service providers, games such as Fortnite and Minecraft, Hotels.com, and Flightgift, which can be redeemed for flights with 300 international airlines. While the company wouldn't share sales numbers on the record with CNBC, Bitrefill does have the endorsement of Janey Gak, who uses it to top up her phone. Her Twitter account has become a must-follow for those who want to understand the situation on the ground through her eyes, but she's also evangelizing the power of bitcoin to transform the country. ""I'm just an ordinary person. I'm not anyone special,"" she said. ""I am just someone who discovered bitcoin a couple of years ago."" In 2018, Gak — who goes by the name ""Bibi Janey"" — started a Facebook page as a hobby to see what Afghans thought of bitcoin. ""I remember getting a lot of comments and questions like, 'Can you explain more?'"" she said. ""People would be fascinated by it, but they would be so confused."" She also got lots of questions about where to buy bitcoin. Since entering this world, she has learned how to code and reads as much as she can about bitcoin. ""I don't trade, I don't do any of that,"" she said. ""I just make some money here and there and save it in bitcoin."" Through her research, she's come to the conclusion that in order for Afghanistan to be a truly sovereign state, it must never borrow money – and adopt a bitcoin standard. To foment wider adoption, Gak commissions articles to be translated to local languages. ""It's not much, but it's a start,"" she told CNBC.

DIY crypto rails

The on-ramp to participating in the crypto economy in Afghanistan is complicated and there are still multiple barriers to entry. Access to the internet, while growing, remains low. There were 8.64 million internet users in Afghanistan in January 2021, according to DataReportal.com and internet penetration stood at 22%. Unreliable electricity poses another major issue, as power outages are common. ""Power goes out once every day for a couple of hours,"" said Ramin, though he noted that it happens in some parts of Kabul more often than others. When CNBC first spoke to Hotak, he was seated near one of the land-crossings into Pakistan, tapping into a WiFi network across the border. ""We don't have proper internet on the Afghanistan side,"" he explained. Hotak also uses solar power to charge his phone, given the country's long-standing issue with electricity outages. Electricity and a stable internet connection are two essential rails for widespread crypto adoption. Also critical is having access to some form of online banking or a credit card that is recognized internationally – which again, poses a big problem for many Afghans. Eighty-five percent of the country is unbanked, according to one U.N. estimate, meaning they do not have a bank account. So people wishing to deal in crypto have to get creative. Hotak and some of his contacts enlist the help of family and friends in neighboring Pakistan or across the Gulf of Oman in the United Arab Emirates, where they have easier access to global markets. ""It's very easy in Pakistan,"" he said. ""Most people have relatives in Dubai, who buy crypto for them using their credit cards."" When the person then wants to liquidate their crypto stake, relatives will sell it for them and use the hawala system, an honor-based system of credit common in Asia and the Middle East, to transfer the funds across the border to Afghanistan. The strategy requires a great deal of trust. In the case of Hotak, his friend in Pakistan doubles as his crypto broker. ""He is a very, very close friend. He has his details on the account that I use, so we could say that it's his account, but I use it,"" Hotak said of the arrangement.

Trust is also key when it comes to judging the quality of trading tips. ""There's a lot of scammers on YouTube and Twitter,"" warned Ramin. When he first started off, he would spend most of his money buying coins promoted by people looking for exit liquidity. ""That's why I stopped trading small-cap coins."" Hotak, on the other hand, has found a reliable online community that offers him sound trading advice. ""There's a few groups on Telegram, WhatsApp, and there's even a Pakistani community on Facebook I follow that gives me the signals to sell. I follow them, and it's been good so far,"" said Hotak. Brokers advertising crypto services on Facebook appear to be operating across the country. Hotak visited one in Herat in early 2020. He went to interview for a job there and says the two-story data center was packed with boys, mostly aged 20 to 25. ""They were all university people,"" he said. ""They all had smartphones in their hands, and they were just scrolling down and down."" CNBC has not spoken with any of these brokerages directly, but Hotak says the site he visited in Herat is still going. Hotak also says that Herat is home to a bitcoin mining farm. ""They had these very big CPUs. Very advanced,"" he said. But Hotak tells CNBC he didn't get to see the entire operation. ""I just got a little glimpse of it."" Blockchain analysts Lorne Lantz and Rieya Piscano say they looked at various data sources and found no sign of bitcoin or ethereum nodes running in Afghanistan, so it is unclear whether this miner in Herat has covered his online footprint, or whether he's cut off his rigs. Even with all of these workarounds, the political turmoil of the last few weeks doesn't make it easy to find time to think about crypto. ""The reality is I cannot focus on crypto trading when the ongoing events in Afghanistan are this intense,"" said Hotak. ""With no electricity and bad internet, crypto trading is near to impossible, so we just hold.""

Path to mass adoption

On Aug. 15, an hour and a half before Ramin's flight bound for Turkey was due to take off, then-President Ghani arrived to the airport in Kabul. After that, Ramin says that all flights were halted and everyone was kicked out. Ramin still has plans to leave, along with his family. But finding a flight is proving to be difficult. He's used his now dwindling supply of afghanis to purchase flights for ten members of his family. He's done this three times, and all three times, the flights were canceled. With travel agencies shut, he remains in a bit of a holding pattern on the ground in Kabul. Ramin is one among many looking to leave the country. Every media outlet on the planet has been circulating the same photos of Afghans clinging to planes, fleeing the country with whatever possessions they can carry. For several, this has meant having to leave a lot behind. Ramin estimates that around 5-10% of his net worth is in crypto, which makes it easier to plan an exit, knowing that there is some money in the bank to tide him over, especially since he doesn't know if he will ever see the money in his bank accounts in Kabul. ""If some type of government doesn't come to existence, then I could potentially see the majority of my wealth being wiped out,"" he said. For now, he and his family are just sitting tight, waiting to catch a flight out. But many people are staying put, in part because they want to foment positive change at home. ""In these circumstances, one can fully appreciate the censorship-resistance property of blockchain-based assets. I believe this is the main driver of the fundamental value of bitcoin and other cryptos,"" said Andrea Barbon, Assistant Professor of Finance at the University of St. Gallen. Gak, for example, thinks that using legacy financial rails like the hawala system might be one of the most effective ways to foster mass adoption. It is a vision she detailed in a prescient story she wrote for Hacker Noon in 2018. She's also thinking about opening her own exchange shop in Kabul. ""The idea is that anyone with bitcoin can exchange it for fiat and then use that to buy goods like always. Anyone who is unable to receive can have their family for example, send the bitcoin to me with a unique address that only the recipient would know just like hawala,"" she explained in a tweet. Ramin has a similar plan to make crypto more accessible to Afghans. ""I hope once I gain more knowledge in blockchain technology to create a team and develop an easily accessible trading platform which Afghans can use,"" he said. There are promising trends on their side. The number of social media users in Afghanistan increased by 22% from 2020 to 2021, and 68.7% of the total population now has a mobile phone connection, according to DataReportal.com. It helps that more than 60% of the population is under 25 and hungry to be a part of the modern economy. Shakib Noori, previously the CEO of a mobile money company in Afghanistan, says this younger demographic also tends to be more tech savvy. Ultimately, CNBC is told that grassroots adoption comes down to one Afghan teaching another about how cryptocurrencies like bitcoin work. Hotak has already mentored three students, and that's just the beginning. ""The Afghan people – they're very complicated. And it's very hard convincing them that digital currency exists,"" he said. ""I have plans to teach people about cryptocurrency in the future...but for now, people are just laying low and waiting to see what happens next.""","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106929612-1629282287651-Screen_Shot_2021-08-18_at_32313_AM.png?v=1629282536',)",none
2021-08-22,Analytics Insight,Cryptocurrency Bill: What Will Be India’s Stand on Digital Assets?,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/cryptocurrency-bill-what-will-be-indias-stand-on-digital-assets/,"Cryptocurrency Bill: What Will Be India’s Stand on Digital Assets?

After a long discussion by the Indian Government over cryptocurrencies in the country, finally a cryptocurrency bill is tabled before the Union Cabinet and everyone is waiting for approval. The bill attempts to regulate virtual currency in India. Presently cryptocurrencies in India are not under any regulation, this makes an unofficial area for Indian investors.

On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the cabinet note was ready on the cryptocurrency bill. She was awaiting Cabinet to clear that, she added.

Under the chairmanship of the Secretary (Economic Affairs), a high-level inter-ministerial panel was formed to explore the issues related to cryptocurrencies and propose specific actions that have already submitted its report. The report advocates that all private cryptocurrencies except the digital currencies that are issued by the state will be forbidden in India.

In the meantime, the RBI discusses the cryptocurrencies traded in the market and has conveyed the same to the government.

Back in May this year, the finance minister conveyed that a very calibrated position is supposed to be taken on crypto and virtual currency as the world is promptly transforming towards technology. Other media reports indicated that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be permitted as an asset class in India.

Highlighting the fact that both the government and the RBI are dedicated to financial strength and solidity, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said there are no differences between the central bank and the Finance Ministry on the matter, and that all should now await the final decision on the matter from the Centre.

Major concerns regarding cryptocurrencies have been identified by the RBI and that the government is in agreement with those concerns, said Mr. Das.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to control the production of its units and validate the transfer of funds, working independently of a central bank.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said, a three-judge bench, led by Justice R F Nariman, is responsible to be set apart on the ground of “proportionality”.

“Therefore, the writ appeals are enabled and the circular dated April 6, 2018, is set apart,” said the bench, which is also involving justices Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Cryptocurrency-Bill-What-Will-Be-Indias-Stand-on-Digital-Assets.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,NDTV Gadgets 360,Cardano (ADA) Price Hits All-Time High Ahead of 'Alonzo' Upgrade,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cardano-ada-price-in-india-all-time-high-cryptocurrency-coin-alonzo-upgrade-founder-charles-hoskinson-2515498,"Cardano (ADA) price has jumped more than 50 percent over the last 10 days to occupy the third spot among the world's top cryptocurrencies with an $80 billion (Rs. 5,94,400 crores) market cap, ahead of the popular Binance Coin. During the wild ride, it touched its lifetime high of $2.58 (Rs. 191.70) but the gains had tapered off a bit by Saturday morning. The rally is being attributed to a coming “Alonzo” upgrade that will allow smart-contract functionality and a range of decentralised finance (DeFi) applications to run on the Cardano network. The proposed technological enhancement is likely to land as soon as next month.

Co-founded by Charles Hoskinson, a mathematician and former CEO of Ethereum, the Cardano network is being touted as a serious rival to the Ethereum blockchain, which currently dominates the DeFi services market. The ADA coin has jumped from $1.70 (Rs 126) on August 10 to $2.58 on August 20, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing this report, the Cardano (ADA) price in India was around Rs. 190.

The lack of smart-contract functions has been widely seen as Cardano's biggest drawback and their availability is Ethereum's biggest strength. These contracts are a way to ensure agreements can be validated securely.

Earlier this month, the development team behind the Alonzo upgrade announced the launch of the public test net, saying it was an “exciting and important next step” in the Cardano journey.

This is an exciting and important next step in the #Alonzo journey. In fact, the #Cardano journey. With the support of our OG community testers on the Blue & White phases, #AlonzoPurple will be the first fully public Cardano testnet to support #smartcontracts ????

2/12 — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) August 6, 2021

Despite the rally and even before it over the possibility of the coming upgrade, some people have shown skepticism about the success of the Cardano coin. This had prompted Hoskinson to respond to the naysayers in a tweet earlier this month, promising to start a fund to pay for the therapy of the critics.

It's extraordinary to me the level of skepticism about our upcoming smart contract launch. It's not something like SCs will be underwhelming, but rather it simply won't happen. The critics say it with biblical level certainty. We should start a fund to pay for their therapy — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) August 4, 2021

Meanwhile, the recent rallies in Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano (ADA), and others have helped the cryptocurrency market to surpass the $2 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,48,50,910 crores) market-cap milestone for the first time since May, when a market crash had routed the volatile trade.

2021-08-22,News18,Bitcoin Maximalists Think Cryptocurrency Could Have Stopped Afghanistan's Takeover. Here's How,https://www.news18.com/news/india/bitcoin-maximalists-think-cryptocurrency-could-have-stopped-afghanistans-takeover-by-taliban-heres-how-4110659.html,"Bitcoin maximalists have been opining that cryptocurrency will and could have been the fix for Afghanistan against Taliban. Some said that war financing could have stopped had crypto been the norm while others empathisized with Afghans worried about their savings as Taliban took over banks.

News18 explains what the maximalists had to say as part of their argument:

How could Bitcoin come to the rescue?

Dr. Josh Cotton, a Bitcoin advocate and founder of MilitaryToken, said in a tweet that “an enormous amount of cash just fell into the hands of the Taliban because cash can’t be truly secured,” adding of course, “Bitcoin fixes this.”

He was hinting towards the enormously secure blockchain technology used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that do not let access to any other individual.

A report by Vice quoted Jimmy Song, one of Bitcoin’s most ardent public advocates saying, “Bitcoin would have prevented the war in Afghanistan had it been the global reserve currency instead of the greenback. No sane government would have spent explicitly taxed dollars on a war that cost that much and lasted that long.”

“The only reason the US could was because of the dollar’s privileged position as the global reserve currency which allowed stealth taxation of the entire world through inflation.”

What is debasement and how are Bitcoiners assuring countries don’t finance war?

Debasement was practiced in the 16th century by England’s King Henry VIII to help fund wars with France and Scotland. The king replaced precious metal content of coins like gold with cheaper metals like copper, reducing the costs of currency production at the expense of taxpayers. Roman emperor Nero used to employ a similar trickery, cutting down on the silver content in the currency. By some estimates, debasement led to annual inflation of around 1,000 percent at one point in Roman history.

Some countries do something similar today, say the proponents of the debasement theory. The government prints more money than it can back up with underlying assets so that it can fund foreign wars, which comes at the expense of citizens in the form of taxes, according to public statements made by various supporters of the theory.

“Bitcoin doesn’t let governments do this crazy deficit spending as they are forced to get loans on the market to do so,” said Jimmy Song.

The idea of inflation as stealth taxation, and its connection with war financing, is one that’s commonly shared by Bitcoin maxis with a libertarian streak

What about Taliban taking over banks and people worrying about savings?

Afghans have been crowding banks trying to access their savings, but mostly in vain.

Not only would Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies make it difficult to confiscate wealth and to keep it safe but the whole situation could have been avoided had the world adopted decentralized money.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be stored on tiny USB thumb drive-sized hardware wallets or on online wallets. A user only needs to remember the corresponding passphrase or key to having access to funds.

2021-08-22,NDTV Gadgets 360,What Is a Blockchain Node and How Is It Used in Cryptocurrency?,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/what-is-a-blockchain-node-how-does-cryptocurrency-work-2515427,"A Node is a part of cryptocurrency that is needed to make most of the popular tokens like Bitcoin or Dogecoin function. It's a fundamental part of the blockchain network, which is the decentralised ledger that is used to maintain a cryptocurrency.

The involvement of a greater number of people in the cryptocurrency market is pushing the desire in them to learn how the system works. This is true for any sector but the newness of cryptocurrency is also leading to curiosity. While you don't really need to understand how blockchain works to be able to benefit from a rise in the price of Bitcoin in India, having a basic understandig of the terms that are thrown around can be useful.

One term you may have heard, but don't know the meaning of, is 'node'. The term is not exclusive to the only cryptocurrency and is widely used outside it. However, a node, in the world of virtual coins, is a computer connected to a cryptocurrency network and can execute certain functions like creating, receiving or sending information.

The explanation can vary depending on the protocol. For example, a resident network may comprise a file server, three laptops and a fax machine. In this case, the network has five nodes, each equipped with a unique MAC address to identify them.

What is a node in blockchain?

The term “node” is being used mostly in relation to blockchain, a decentralised digital ledger that records all cryptocurrency transactions and makes the information available to everyone via a connected device. What this means is every transaction has to be chronologically recorded and distributed to a series of connected devices. These devices are called nodes. These nodes communicate with each other within the network and transfer information about transactions and new blocks.

It is a critical component of the blockchain infrastructure. It helps maintain the security and integrity of the network. A blockchain node's main purpose is to verify each batch of network transactions, called blocks. Each node is distinguished from others by a unique identifier.

What are the types of nodes?

There are basically two types of nodes: full nodes and lightweight nodes.

Full nodes support and provide security to the network. These nodes download a blockchain's entire history to observe and enforce its rules.

Each user in the network is a lightweight node. The lightweight node has to connect to a full node to be able to participate.

Many volunteers run full Bitcoin nodes in a bid to help the Bitcoin ecosystem. As of now, there are roughly 12,130 public nodes running on the Bitcoin network. Other than the public nodes, there are many hidden nodes (non-listening nodes). These nodes usually run behind a firewall.

Miners' nodes

There is also a third type of node: Miner nodes. The term “Bitcoin miners” has now become familiar. These miners are classified as nodes. miner may work alone (solo miner) or in groups (pool miner). A solo miner uses his own full node. In a mining pool, only the administrator can run a full node — which can be referred to as a pool miner's full node.

Listening nodes (supernodes)

And finally, a sub-category called listening nodes. A listening node, essentially, is a publicly visible full node. It communicates with any node that decides to establish a connection with it. A reliable super node typically runs all the time, transmitting blockchain history and transaction data to multiple nodes.","('https://cdn.ndtv.com/tech/images/blockchain_removed_apple_app_store.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,Analytics Insight,Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in This Weekend,https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-cryptocurrencies-to-invest-in-this-weekend-august-edition/,"Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in This Weekend – August Edition

These cryptocurrencies are showing strong potential in the market.

Cryptocurrencies are growing to become stronger investment options as months go by. Keeping an eye on the crypto trends, a lot of new and seasoned investors are gearing up to make crypto investments. For that, Analytics Insight has made this of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this weekend.

1. Bitcoin

After the crypto market crash in the first half of 2021, experts were anticipating Bitcoin’s rise. After falling from grace, from US$60,000 to US$30,000, Bitcoin has finally crossed the US$45,000 mark. This marks Bitcoin’s potential to give good returns to investors who are looking to make long-term profits.

2. Ethereum

Next to Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency. Its blockchain network transformed the DeFi sector and made way for decentralized apps. Recently, Ethereum launched its much-awaited new update that will improve the transaction fees and reduce Ether’s inflation. This change makes it easy for investors to understand the value of investing in Ether and give miners a fair fee.

3. XRP

XRP is purely a utility token created by Ripple. XRP’s blockchain platform aims to set up cross-border currencies without any hindrance. Since its launch, many banks have realized the capabilities of this token and the volume of transactions on this network has increased since then. One of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to buy, XRP has a bright future in the crypto market.

4. Tether

Tether is unlike most cryptocurrencies in the market as it is a stable coin. A stable coin is a digital token that has a fixed value and is pegged to a fiat currency, like the Euro or the Dollar. Similarly, Tether has a fixed value of US$1 or equivalent and maintains US$1 in reserve for each Tether issued.

5. USD Coin

USD Coin is a more popular stable coin as its value is strictly pegged to the US dollar. Stable coins withstand market volatility better and offer a more risk-free investment option.

6. Cardano

Cardano is known for its proof-of-stake network. Its open blockchain platform is open-source and decentralized. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its native token, Ada. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies to invest in.

7. Dogecoin

Dogecoin needs no introduction. It has made enough headlines, thanks to Elon Musk’s obsession with making cryptocurrencies trending. What once started as a joke has now become a legitimate investment option with its value that grew more than 50% since its inception. It’s also one of the cheapest cryptocurrencies to invest in.

8. Binance Coin

Binance Coin is a token native to the Binance exchange, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. As long as there is activity on the Binance exchange, Binance coin will continue to steadily grow. Ranked among the top six cryptocurrencies in the world, Binance coin can be used to trade other cryptocurrencies as well.

9. Litecoin

Litecoin is a rival for Bitcoin’s blockchain network. Litecoin aims to pay for everyday goods and services with transactions faster than Bitcoin. Litecoin has been recognized for its practical purpose by market experts and trade merchants. This means Litecoin is a crypto that can suddenly take on a bull run.

10. NEO

Similar to Ethereum, NEO is a platform for smart contracts. Launched in 2014, NEO’s mission is to improve Ethereum’s network by offering the same utility functions via a more sophisticated blockchain. While NEOs network is superior to Ethereum, it will only reach its full potential in a couple of years. The wait will be worth it for investors.","('https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Top-Cryptocurrencies-to-Invest-In-This-Weekend.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,Yahoo Finance,"Ethereum: We Got the “Pullback, Rally,” Expect a More Significant Pullback Soon",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-got-pullback-rally-expect-183640779.html,"Last week, see here, I was looking for a smaller degree 4th wave pullback, then a 5th wave rally to complete a larger 1st wave top. Ethereum, aka Ether (ETH), took a slight detour by first rallying to the ideal 161.80% extension for a b-wave and then dropped into this week’s low for what is most likely the c-wave of wave-iv and wave-v (the “Rally”) to ideally $3415-3585 should now be underway. See Figure 1 below.

Figure 1. ETH daily chart with EWP count and technical indicators.

The pullback came and went, now in the rally to complete wave-1

Elliott Wave Principle (EWP) fourth waves are inherently difficult to forecast, track, and trade, and the last few days showed once again this is the case. Namely, what we got was most likely an irregular flat 4th wave, where the (green) b-wave topped above the end of the 3rd wave (red wave-iii). Since corrections, and flat waves, in particular, are always made up of at least three waves (a, b,c), we know that “after wave-b, comes wave-c” and in this case (green) wave-c of (Red) wave-iv bottomed on Wednesday.

Albeit not shown, 4th waves typically retrace between 23.60 and 38.20% of the prior 3rd wave, which would be the $2935-2785 zone. ETH bottomed at $2952 on Wednesday, off by 0.58% and thus close enough (well within the margins of error!). Therefore, as long as this low holds, we should expect ETH to reach the ideal wave-v of the wave-1 target zone of $3415-3585. From there, a multi-week correction, wave-2, should unfold. See Figure 1 above. It can target anywhere between $2145-2865 depending on how deep or shallow this wave-2 will become. It is impossible to know beforehand.

However, typically 2nd waves retrace about 50-62% of the entire prior 1st wave, so I anticipate for now -without having any data at hand yet to confirm a bottom in the $2380-2590 zone (orange rectangle). Once more price data becomes available, I can fine-tune this pending and anticipated low. Remember, all we can do is “anticipate, monitor, and adjust”. But few methods, if any, can already make such forecasts as the EWP can. For now, ETH has topped and bottomed where it should for a smaller 3rd and a 4th wave, so there’s nothing yet to suggest the minor 5th wave and more significant 2nd wave will not unfold as anticipated.

Story continues

Last but not least, please note how price reached the (blue arrow) symmetry breakout target to the T. When classic Technical Analysis and the EWP align, price forecast can be very accurate and reliable. Now “the traffic light” is also back to full green, so I expect higher prices over the next few days.

Bottom line: The devil is always in the details, and one can therefore not foresee every move. The anticipated “pullback” became a bit more complex, but ETH is overall tracking along with the preferred EWP impulse pattern well. As such, my premium crypto trading members knew exactly where to expect the pullback bottom and subsequent rally. Thus, as long as this low holds, we should expect ETH to reach the ideal wave-v of the wave-1 target zone of $3415-3585. From there, I still anticipate a correction back to the mid-$2000s before the rally to new All-time highs should kick in.

2021-08-22,Deseret News,Shiba Inu coin may be on the rise. Here are the latest predictions,https://www.deseret.com/2021/8/20/22633905/shib-coin-shiba-inu-predictions-fall-2021,"The Shiba Inu cryptocurrency token may be rising once again, demonstrating a “bullish” trend as its climbs higher and higher in value.

What’s happening with Shib coin?

Shib coin — a meme-based cryptocurrency that is a nod to the Dogecoin crypto token — has risen by 60% in recent weeks since it reached its lowest value ever in July, according to Investing Cube.

The price has shown there’s still strong support for the crypto token as there has been a significant movement over 25-day and 50-day periods.

Related Why Shib coin is gaining attention again

What are Shib coin predictions?

One prediction from Investing Cube suggests that the coin will see another round of resistance when it reaches a value of $0.0000096. But the trend still points upward for the Shib coin.

Shib coin currently has a high entry price for new investors, and there doesn’t seem to be a massive movement for the coin right now, according to FX Street.

Though cryptocurrency is rising right now, Shiba Inu coin hasn’t had such a strong rise recently, which has made it challenging for new investors to embrace the meme-based cryptocurrency.

How will Shib coin rise again?

According to Investor Place, the coin could use a boost from some social media hype. Specifically, Tesla CEO Elon Musk — who has previously embraced Dogecoin — could drum up enough support if he were to mention the coin again, per Investor Place.","('https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l4HoBPUYmevYz_yQsk4Yg2WBqL8=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22524142/Dogecoin_4.jpg',)",none

Ethereum Classic Daily Chart Analysis

Ethereum Classic looks to be forming a cup pattern (orange) inside of a sideways channel. The price is now starting to approach a previous resistance level.

The crypto trades above both the 50-day moving average (green) and the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating recent sentiment has been bullish.

These moving averages may both hold as an area of support in the future.

The $80 level has held as resistance multiple times in the past and may act as resistance again as the price nears the level. The cup may hold as support as the stock continues its upward push.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also has been moving higher and now sits at 63. This shows that there has been more buying pressure in the stock than selling pressure.

What’s Next For Ethereum Classic?

Bullish traders are looking to see Ethereum Classic continue to move higher above the cup pattern. Bulls are looking to see the price cross above resistance and be able to hold above the $80 level.

Bearish traders would like to see Ethereum Classic fall below the cup pattern and head back toward $40 support. Eventually bears would like to see the price fall below the $40 support and hold as a resistance level. This could cause a further downward push.","('https://cdn2.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/blockchain-3448502_1920_180.jpg?width=720',)",none
2021-08-22,East Idaho News,Cryptocurrency mining company removes barriers and simplifies the process for customers,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2021/08/cryptocurrency-mining-company-removes-barriers-and-simplifies-the-process-for-customers/,"IDAHO FALLS – Cryptocurrency has become an increasingly popular investment option in the last several years.

A local company capitalizes on this trend by mining for it.

Braxton Ball is the operations manager and co-owner of T-Ball Miners, a company that has been hosting miners for the last six years in an Idaho Falls warehouse. The warehouse houses a large network of computers that process cryptocurrency transactions around the world.

“Just like Visa has a data center that processes U.S. dollar transactions, Bitcoin transactions are processed with Bitcoin miners. As a reward, people that mine Bitcoin get paid in Bitcoin,” Ball tells EastIdahoNews.com.

Bitcoin is just one type of cryptocurrency T-Ball deals with. Others include Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Zcash.

Each computer is equipped with a mining unit that processes these digital transactions, which are added to a worldwide pool and distributed among each miner.

“The miners are trying to solve a math equation, and it’s called a block. When they solve a block, it makes the next block in the blockchain,” says Ball. “We connect our miners with miners around the world, and we all work together to solve the same equation at the same time.”

Each miner is rewarded, depending on how much work they put into solving the equation, he says, and there’s a monthly fee to do it. Without miners, Ball says cryptocurrency transactions would not be possible. See what it’s like in the video player above.

Ball was introduced to cryptocurrency as a day trader in the stock market about six years ago. It first popped on his radar when people started trading Bitcoin.

“It started popping up a lot and I saw people were trading Bitcoin because the markets never close,” he says.

As he did some more research, he started asking himself why you would buy Bitcoin if you could make it.

RELATED | Good Question: What is bitcoin?

“If you buy one Bitcoin, in a year you’ll have one Bitcoin. If you buy one Bitcoin with the miners, in a year you might have four Bitcoins,” says Ball. “We see mining as the cheapest way to obtain cryptocurrency, and it’s a great passive revenue stream.”

A massive amount of power is required to run a cryptocurrency mining company. Ball says T-Ball Miners consumes one kilowatt-hours worth of electricity every second. Idaho Falls was selected as a location because it has one of the cheapest power rates in the nation.

Ball is also married to his co-owner’s daughter, who is from Idaho Falls.

Since 2015, Ball says the cryptocurrency market has continued to evolve. Today, there are 10,000 different types of cryptocurrency, and more companies are starting to use it.

“I lived in California for a while, and almost all the restaurants there accept it,” he says.

Visa and Mastercard offer a Bitcoin debit card that will convert it into dollars when you swipe it. Tom Tueller, the other co-owner in the business, says there’s an apartment complex in Rexburg that accepts rent payments in Bitcoin.

“And companies like Walmart and Apple are posting job openings every day for cryptocurrency specialists,” Ball says.

Both Ball and Tueller say cryptocurrency is the trend of the future and will eventually become the norm.

“It’s already been proposed in the U.S. Senate that every U.S. citizen will be given a digital address. That’s how they originally wanted to send out all the stimulus checks last year,” Ball says. “It was declined, but the fact that it’s already been proposed tells you where the future is headed.”

Regardless of your experience or level of understanding with cryptocurrency, Ball says T-Ball Miner’s job is to remove all the barriers and simplify the process for everyone.

“You don’t have to understand the entire industry to get into mining. We take all the technical out of it,” says Ball.

Ethereum price steadies at key support, but bearish momentum divergence remains a concern.

XRP price rebounds from the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level with authority, prepares to press higher.

Bitcoin price, along with Ethereum and Ripple, has respected key support levels during the consolidations, with BTC and ETH correcting in time versus price, demonstrating the strength of the underlying bid.

Bitcoin price battles momentum divergence

Bitcoin price has emerged from the recent consolidation around the 50% retracement of the April-July correction at $46,849 and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $45,719, reclaiming the 2020 ascending trend line that had become influential on price since August 7.

Today’s breakout, if it holds, has the potential to stretch the Bitcoin price rally to the 78.6% retracement of the April-June correction at $57,173 in the coming days before striking formidable resistance framed by the February, March, April and May highs. At that level, BTC investors can anticipate a substantive pullback.

A bearish BTC development that may interrupt the Bitcoin price journey higher is the emerging bearish momentum divergence on the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). A bearish momentum divergence occurs when the RSI does not confirm new price highs with a new high.

BTC/USD daily chart

Even if the new Bitcoin price breakout fails to gain traction above the 2020 ascending trend line, it is well supported by the earlier trifecta of support between $41,500 and $43,000, which includes the January high, the February low, the June high, and the 38.2% retracement level. Only a daily close below $41,500 would alter the bullish BTC narrative.

Here, FXStreet's analysts evaluate where BTC could be heading next as it looks primed to retrace.

Ethereum price faces a short term obstacle

The Ethereum price consolidation has been in time versus price, keeping the downside limited to -10% and confirming the previous resistance between $2,900 and $3,050 has become a new layer of support for the smart contracts giant.

The immediate potential for Ethereum price to mark a trajectory to the all-time high of $4,384 is weighed down by the resistance of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the May-July correction at $3,358 and the 261.8% Fibonacci extension of the 2018 secular correction at $3,587. After those two levels, ETH is free to explore a new all-time high, including a jump to the 361.8% extension of the 2018 secular correction at $4,926.

Despite the bullish price structure, the daily RSI is showing a bearish momentum divergence at the recent Ethereum price high, indicating that the underlying momentum driving ETH has waned and questioning the ability of ETH to break the resistance levels mentioned above.

ETH/USD daily chart

Critical to the bullish forecast for Ethereum price is the durability of the support between $2,900 to $3,050. A daily close below introduces the potential for ETH to target the 50-day SMA at $2,486 or even the 200-day SMA at $2,313. It would be a significant bearish development, pointing to a more complex bottoming process or a resumption of the cyclical correction initiated in May.

Here, FXStreet's analysts evaluate where ETH could be heading next as it tests crucial resistance level.

XRP price awaits a Golden Cross

XRP price has exploded higher since closing above the noteworthy resistance associated with the 200-day SMA on August 7, logging a 65% gain last week and breaking the resistance aligned with the psychologically important $1.00 and the 38.2% retracement of the April-July cyclical Ripple correction at $1.06.

This week XRP price has opted for consolidation, pulling back around 20% and successfully testing the $1.00-$1.06 range with a robust three-day rebound. The rebound repositioned Ripple at the 50% retracement of the April-July correction and removed the excess overbought condition daily RSI.

Moving forward, XRP price is poised to continue the new rally with some possible resistance at the 61.8% retracement at $1.40 before encountering heavy push-back at the 78.6% retracement, which is reinforced by a series of highs printed in the first half of May. It represents close to a 30% return from the current Ripple price.

Additionally, Ripple will be featuring a bullish Golden Cross on the daily chart within the next week if the upside XRP price momentum continues.

XRP/USD daily chart

A renewal of the XRP price pullback needs to hold the $1.00-$1.06 range on a daily closing basis. If not, Ripple will endure a 15% fall to the 200-day SMA at $0.84, thereby dimming the bullish aspirations of not only a break of the April high at $1.96 but also the all-time high of $3.30 recorded in January 2018.

The cryptocurrency majors continue to flex a bullish posture, discovering support at the crucial support prices while showing no distribution on down days. It is consistent with a strong cryptocurrency market and creates the energy for new rally highs and all-time highs for BTC and ETH.

Here, FXStreet's analysts evaluate where Ripple could be heading next as it seems primed for a pullback before higher highs.","('https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Digital Currencies/Bitcoin/bitcoins-37949586_Large.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,Yahoo Finance,Galaxy Digital floats blockchain fund as bet on cryptocurrency's booming DeFi movement,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/galaxy-digital-floats-blockchain-fund-as-bet-on-cryptocurrencys-booming-de-fi-movement-171702712.html,"As the nascent concept of decentralized finance (DeFi) gains traction in cryptocurrency trading — and draws more regulatory scrutiny — new players are creating products to meet rising demand.

Enter Galaxy Digital (GLXY.TO), which this week rolled out a DeFi Index Fund, their newest blockchain-based financial asset. The passive instrument tracks the performance of Bloomberg’s Galaxy DeFi Index, and is part of an estimated $80 billion industry that's poised for explosive growth in the coming years.

DeFi is not a new segment of the crypto space, but it has grown exponentially in the past year from $6.8 billion to $80 billion, according to data from DeFi Pulse.

Ben Samaroo, the CEO of a DeFi platform called WonderFi, explained to Yahoo Finance recently that the sector ""presents a faster, cheaper way to do finance."" He added that DeFi allows users to borrow money ""instantly"" without bank approval, or earn higher-than-average interest on assets.

Galaxy Digital's new fund is an attempt to offer clients a lower risk, and more regulatory-friendly way, to gain exposure to DeFi. The fund has been seeded by NZ Funds, a $2 billion institution that manages retirement savings accounts for New Zealanders.

NZ Funds is not a newcomer to investing in the crypto space. Previously, the retirement savings institution seeded Galaxy Digital’s Ethereum (ETH-USD) fund earlier this year. Before that, it took part in a $50 million private investment in Galaxy Digital Holdings’s public equity.

The Index is composed of 9 DeFi protocols in portions of 40 to 1 percent exposure. The protocols will be considered for addition and removal on a monthly basis.

While index funds aren’t intended to be actively managed, the removal or addition of DeFi protocols will rely on Bloomberg's principles for measuring an index such as data integrity, diversification, representation and continuity.

Growing scrutiny, and opportunities to profit

Bloomberg's Galaxy DeFi Index compared with Bitcoin and Ethereum

DeFi is a family of crypto assets and underlying protocols which together form a complex financial system that relies most heavily on the Ethereum blockchain. Like much of the crypto world, DeFi's key selling point is stripping out the middle man in trading, which cuts costs and red tape.

Using self-executing (or ""smart"") digital contracts, developers can build applications on top of Ethereum and other blockchains. They are then used to devise new ways to borrow, lend and exchange assets in faster and cheaper ways than traditional finance.

While these projects cut out traditional intermediaries in the financial sector via peer-to-peer networks, not all DeFi protocols may be decentralized enough to skirt regulation. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said as much in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published this week, in which he suggested the agency would be taking a closer look at the sector.

Meanwhile, a widening range of big money players are now gawking at cryptocurrency and blockchain-based protocols, trying to understand whether crypto is supposed to fit in their portfolios. And for many traditional investors, taking the plunge requires some level of valuation.

Nick Juhle, director of research for wealth management firm Greenleaf Trust, faces this problem. With a total of $17 billion in assets under advisement, Greenleaf provides wealth management to approximately 1000 high-net worth individuals.

Since 2017, Juhle has received calls from clients every time Bitcoin's price surges, asking why the firm hasn't parked any cash in crypto. Yet Juhle still won't budge, because his team hasn't found a way to value it based on traditional valuation frameworks like cash flow and earnings results.

""The challenge with crypto, Bitcoin being the prime example, is that it doesn't really have intrinsic value. You can price it but you can't really value it. That's always the issue that we've run into,"" says Juhle. At this point, valuing the best DeFi protocols runs into the same issue for Juhle.

However, there is no unifying collective valuation framework for DeFi, according to Steve Kurz, Galaxy Digital’s Head of Asset Management. It's a clear barrier for more traditional retail and institutional investors with no crypto exposure, even if they are willing to accept the higher volatility synonymous with crypto.

Currently, the Galaxy Digital team uses “different strands” of metrics, such as the total value locked in protocols and other network usage statistics, to measure potential returns similar to how early stage venture capital performs valuation. Given time, the DeFi Index could provide one more strand for measurement.

“We are marching toward a collective valuation framework that's not quite ready for institutional primetime, but there’s enough to say as a venture [capital] bet, absolutely, DeFi can make sense in a portfolio,” Kurz told Yahoo Finance in an interview.

Juhle prefers the idea of an index fund that invests in the DeFi theme broadly, as opposed to ""betting on a specific protocol."" He also remains wary of the DeFi index's current correlation with the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum.

""Perhaps it will diverge over time as the market matures,"" Juhle suggested.

2021-08-22,Yahoo Finance,Blockchain: What is it and what does it have to do with crypto?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blockchain-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-crypto-171503722.html,"Blockchain is a type of database composed of a growing list of records, individually known as blocks, that are chained together through computer cryptography. The goal of blockchain is to allow for the recording and distribution of digital information that is unable to be tampered with.

Unlike a typical database where data is electronically stored in a “table” format, data within a blockchain is stored within its connected blocks, with each block containing information about the block that came before it. It is this characteristic that creates a resistance to modification of a blockchain’s data, because a change to one block’s information would require the alteration of all subsequent blocks created. And although blockchains are not entirely unalterable, as a collectively agreed-upon update to the network may be known as a “fork,” blockchains are designed to be foundationally secure.

Blockchains are typically managed through a peer-to-peer network of computers working together to serve as a publicly distributed ledger of data (or transactions). Every node in the network follows a specific protocol which the entire blockchain adheres to in order to validate new blocks and communicate with each other.

What does blockchain have to do with cryptocurrencies?

Although blockchain comes up in nearly every conversation involving cryptocurrencies, the two terms cannot be used interchangeably. Rather, blockchain is the network and platform through which cryptocurrency is transacted and generated. For example, the ether (ETH-USD) cryptocurrency operates through the ethereum blockchain.

Blockchain technology had been discussed in scientific literature for nearly two decades before the advent of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ether — the two largest by market cap — with cryptocurrencies becoming one of the first and most widely known applications of blockchain. In 2009, an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto” invented the first cryptocurrency through the bitcoin blockchain to serve as a public ledger for transactions of bitcoin.

Story continues

One of the most significant solutions that a digital currency through blockchain technology provides is an answer to the double-spending problem. In addition, it provides this solution along with all of its functionality without the need for a trusted central authority or server. As mentioned previously, because a blockchain network consists of computer nodes which can be located anywhere in the world, blockchains, and therefore cryptocurrencies, operate as completely decentralized platforms.

Decentralization, along with the pseudo-anonymity offered by cryptocurrency as a means of saving and payment — as cryptocurrency wallets do not require verification such as state identification to use — is one of the themes that has made blockchain technology and cryptocurrency so popular and controversial. Other potential benefits offered by blockchain as a currency platform include 24/7, 365-day operation, transaction fees determined by a market, speed, security, and ease of access.

Other blockchain applications

Although cryptocurrency is undoubtedly the most famous application of blockchain, blockchain technology can be used for many other practical applications as well. For example, the banking and finance industry could benefit greatly from blockchain’s speed, security, and lack of set hours of operation. Other areas of society and business that could stand to benefit from usage of this technology include federal currencies, the healthcare industry, supply chains, and even democratic elections. Each of these could leverage one or all of the previously mentioned benefits that blockchain has to offer.

Cardano jumped 25% in a two-day surge that catapulted it to the third-biggest cryptocurrency.

The surge was fueled by a looming protocol upgrade to cardano called Alonzo that would bring full-functionality smart contracts to the blockchain.

Cardano's last major leap - just last week - was also driven by Alonzo upgrade news.

Cardano jumped 25% in a two-day surge that catapulted the ethereum competitor to the third-biggest cryptocurrency, edging out Binance coin but still short of ether.

Cardano's ada token leaped to as high as $2.58 on Friday from a Wednesday closing price of $2.05. The token, launched in 2017, has seen startling growth in 2021, exploding 1367% in price this year.

The surge was fueled by a looming protocol upgrade to cardano called Alonzo that would bring full-functionality smart contracts to the blockchain, in a clear challenge to ethereum. The upgrade is set for early October, though some market participants are skeptical of that launch date, according to CoinDesk. The upgrade was previously bumped from September to October.

The higher price made Cardano's ada the third-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap at more than $80 billion, ahead of Binance coin at $69 billion. However, it still has a ways to go before displacing ethereum, worth some $380 billion.

Cardano's last major leap - just last week - was also driven by Alonzo upgrade news. Investors ""were hyped on the optimism that a supposedly superior blockchain infrastructure with the possibility to support the next generation of smart contracts is on the horizon,"" executive director of crypto exchange CEX.IO Konstantin Anissimov told Insider at the time.

Cardano's price action comes as interest grows in exploring ethereum alternatives. Users have long complained that ethereum's high ""gas"" fees limit the cryptocurrency's reach, a problem that the recent EIP-1559 protocol upgrade is trying to address.

Cardano was trading at $2.54 as of 12:05 p.m. ET, up 19.4% in the last 24 hours.","('https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/611fd4731c47770019e69bd3?format=jpeg',)",none

Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) are up 6.82%, 8.16%, and 8.36% in the past 24 hours. As of 10:30 a.m. EDT, they are now trading at $48,518.76 per coin, $3,293.94 per token, and $0.3319 apiece, respectively.

Earlier in the day, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN), the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, announced it would be adding $500 million worth of cryptocurrency to its balance sheet. The move sent the whole sector into a monstrous rally. Coinbase stock is also up 3.10% to $255.98 per share in the same period.

So what

It's not just Coinbase's big move that investors are happy about. On Aug. 19, the second-largest mortgage lender in the U.S., UWM Holdings, announced it would start accepting Bitcoin for home loans. The adoption could take effect by the end of the third quarter, and the company is also considering adding other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum into the mix.

Speaking of Ethereum, it was revealed on the same day that the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract had become the largest holder of Ether -- at $21.3 billion. The news illustrates growing confidence in the Ethereum Foundation's transition to its 2.0 network. By the end of 2022, Ethereum will run a proof-of-stake protocol, which its development team estimates will cut its energy use by 99% -- essentially wiping out concerns about its environmental sustainability.

As for Dogecoin, the once-meme digital currency is growing in recognition. During popular discount brokerage Robinhood Markets' earnings release on Aug. 18, the company disclosed that Dogecoin accounted for 62% of cryptocurrency revenue in the second quarter. The same day, Ethereum's founder Vitalik Buterin announced he would be joining the development team behind Dogecoin as a board member.

Now what

Dogecoin is leaving behind its reputation as a joke cryptocurrency. Since the beginning of the year, the number of merchants accepting Doge as payment has grown by 34.7% to 1,616. In addition, the network has found its unique niche due to its slight inflationary nature. Dogecoin miners do not face the threat of their high-tech GPU mining rigs becoming redundant with the rise of PoS protocols. At the same time, the mining isn't so difficult as to induce heavy electricity use.

Bitcoin's slow, archaic, and environmentally unfriendly protocol is finally getting an overhaul, too. In a rare act of solidarity, miners worldwide reached the consensus for Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade, which will allow smart contract adoption on its network and is scheduled to take effect in November. Bitcoin has no central development team, so it's up to a unanimous vote from miners to upgrade the world's biggest cryptocurrency. The last one happened four years ago.

Overall, investors' fear, uncertainty, and doubt -- known in the cryptocurrency world as FUD -- regarding the sector in Q2 are melting away very quickly as new innovations are beginning to address these issues. It's looking like the start of the next bull run for the cryptocurrency sector.","('https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/640139/gettyimages-1171929176.jpg',)",none

However, crypto experts say they are hoping for the best.Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of crypto trading platform Mudrex , says, ""We could expect an accommodative and progressive stance by the government towards cryptocurrencies. The government is expected to evaluate all possible aspects. All these events transpire to positive expectations from the cryptocurrency bill.""An inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency, under the secretary (economic affairs), had studies issues around virtual currencies and proposed specific actions in its report.Looking at the growing opportunities in this space, Siddharth Menon, COO of cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, says calibrated regulations that encourage the industry and safeguard consumers will help the ecosystem grow. ""We don't know the details but we expect it to be positive. Once we have more details, we will comment. Else it will be purely speculative,"" Menon adds.Some experts say India cannot be as a laggard when the world is rapidly moving ahead with blockchain technology. This has led to reports that crypto as an asset class might be allowed in India but the government will not accept it as legal tender as yet.Crypto enthusiasts are betting on analyst views that say there might not be a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies. Menon is among those who does not think a blanket ban is possible. The government has understood crypto assets are not a threat to national currency. ""Also, this is a new and growing global fintech industry. India cannot stay behind,"" he adds.Nobody is yet certain about the government's stance in the bill, says Patel, but adds: ""Legislation without a blanket ban would undoubtedly boost the crypto ecosystem in India.""Experts say there is a healthy startup ecosystem that has sprawled up around digital currencies. India has about 15 million people trading in cryptos , said a Bloomberg report in June.Sharan Nair, Chief Business Officer at crypto exchange platform CoinSwitch Kuber, says, investors should not panic. ""The government would ensure that investor interest is protected at all cost.""In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had advised all entities regulated by it to not deal in digital currencies. In 2020, the Supreme Court set aside the central bank’s 2018 circular and allowed banks and financial institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrencies. In May 2021, the RBI permitted banks to facilitate cryptos. ""There are no differences between the central bank and the finance ministry,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said.Negative news from the government will have impact just like it did in 2018, when most of the entrepreneurs either stopped working in this space or left the country, says Menon. ""After the RBI lifted the ban, we have seen a lot more interest among entrepreneurs and tech talent to enter this space. More crypto projects have been born since then,"" he adds.","('https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85489438,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-271455,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg',)",none

The only catch? They can't sell it

COOL VALLEY, Mo. — A tiny Missouri town could become the first in the country to put Bitcoin in the hands of every resident.

Jayson Stewart, the Mayor of Cool Valley says he is raising funds to give each of the town’s roughly 1500 inhabitants a piece of the digital currency.

Many experts expect Bitcoin to grow in value exponentially in the next decade.

“My daughter says she thinks it's the next big thing. The digital currency,” said Ramona Nickels, a mail carrier who lives in Cool Valley.

“Look, it's digital gold,” said Mayor Stewart. “I would like to see every single household in my city receive some level of Bitcoin, whether it be $500 or $1,000.”

So what is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is one of many cryptocurrencies available today.

It is considered the most well-known cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has been around since 2008.

Think of Bitcoin like regular money. Except it's not issued by any country or impacted by traditional inflation.

You don't need a bank to use, store or transfer Bitcoin. It's completely online. Some economists believe if Bitcoin’s value keeps increasing at its current rate, it could one day become the world's currency.

Recently, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin it's legal tender. It was a move made to protect the country’s economy from rapidly rising inflation.

In Cool Valley, Stewart thinks holding the digital currency could be transformational.

“I have friends whose lives have been completely changed, like going from working a regular nine to five job to being worth over 80 million dollars in a matter of a few years,” said Stewart, who calls himself an Entrepreneur and Environmentalist.

Stewart said most of the money to fund the plan will come from several unnamed Bitcoin investors.

“I have some very supportive donors who have agreed to match any money that I raise up to several millions of dollars,” said Stewart. “I'm trying to get a few government funds as well to go along with that. Or potentially some of the relief money that comes in from the Covid relief.""

But Stewart isn’t ruling out using city funds, saying “It's possible. We'll see how it goes. We'll see how it goes.”

Save it, don’t sell it

Stewart says the Bitcoin will come with some strings attached. He doesn’t want residents to sell for a few years.

“We're putting in place like a vesting schedule for Bitcoin. The idea is that maybe you don't touch it for five years before you really get full access to it. We're working on ideas like that because that's my number one concern. Someone just sells their bitcoin to pay their car note. And then when Bitcoin is sitting at like $500,000 all these years later, they're going to really regret that,” said Stewart.



Roughly 1500 people live in Cool Valley. The dozen or so the I-Team spoke with seemed receptive to the plan.

“With cash people have bad habits and they buy things they shouldn't be buying. But with Bitcoin, maybe you can give it to your kids. My daughter is going to college next year. I could give [the Bitcoin] to her,” said Nickels.

“Putting money in my pocket! Sounds pretty good to me,” said Cornelius Webb, who lives in Cool Valley.

“I believe that Cool Valley is going to get wealthier and wealthier , not just our city, but the actual people who live here,” said Stewart.

Stewart said the city is also going to take proactive measures to off set the environmental impact Bitcoin mining is known to have.

“We're giving away Bitcoin and at the same time we're converting our entire city to solar, like all of the government lights and things like that,” said Stewart.

Details about how Bitcoin will be distributed are still unclear.

Stewart said it will involve door knocking and offering free classes to residents about how to use and securely store Bitcoin.

2021-08-22,CNBC,Coinbase is buying $500 million in crypto and investing future profits into a crypto portfolio,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/coinbase-is-buying-500-million-in-crypto-and-investing-future-profits-into-a-crypto-portfolio.html,"The logo for Coinbase Global Inc, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is displayed on the Nasdaq MarketSite jumbotron and others at Times Square in New York, U.S., April 14, 2021.

Coinbase will buy $500 million in crypto on its balance sheet and allocate 10% of its quarterly profits into a crypto assets portfolio, company executives announced late Thursday.

The company plans to invest in ""Ethereum, Proof of Stake assets, DeFi tokens, and many other crypto assets supported for trading on our platform,"" becoming the first public company to do so, finance chief Alesia Haas said in a blog post.

CEO Brian Armstrong first revealed the brokerage's plans in an earlier tweet, saying he expects the allocation to grow as the market matures. He also indicated the company's ambitions to diversify its crypto services and operations, which mostly center around trading.

""Hopefully over time we can operate more of our business in crypto,"" Armstrong said on Twitter. ""Today it is still a mix.""

The price of bitcoin climbed higher on the news, passing $47,000 on Friday after sitting below $45,000 the previous two days. Coinbase shares rose more than 3% higher in early trading Friday.

The few companies that have included bitcoin in their holdings, like Microstrategy and Tesla (with the help of Coinbase), have done so as a hedge against inflation and potential devaluation of the U.S. dollar. On Thursday, Citi placed Microstrategy's rating under review, suspending its price target and estimates due to its investment in bitcoin and correlation to the digital currency's price.

The news comes a week after Palantir reported quarterly results showing it bought $50 million in physical gold to reportedly hedge against black swan events. Palantir also said it's accepting customer payments in bitcoin, but that none have used the option.

That same week, Coinbase reported quarterly earnings and growth metrics that wowed analysts, who are mostly patient about the stock's correlation to bitcoin's price and volatility and optimistic about its plans to drive long-term innovation throughout the financial system.

Haas said the investments will be driven by its custodial crypto balances and deployed ""over a multi-year window using a dollar cost averaging strategy."" She added that Coinbase is investing for the long term and ""will only divest under select circumstances, such as an asset delisting from our platform.""

Oppenheimer's Owen Lau said he doesn't expect the new investment policy to lower the correlation between Coinbase and bitcoin ""materially in the near future."" However, he said he sees it as a signal that Coinbase can ""further facilitate and influence both retail and institutional adoption"" over time by integrating cryptocurrencies into its own operations, like paying vendors and employees, for example.

The news follows a Wall Street Journal report this week that Coinbase has stockpiled $4 billion in cash to weather regulatory headwinds. Lau noted the company still has plenty of cash on hand despite the transaction.

""Share repurchases and dividends appear to be off the table at least near term, but we believe management will use excess capital to reinvest in the business and make acquisitions, especially in international presence and subscription-based business,"" he added.","('https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106868176-1618411319630-106868176-16184112292021-04-14t143834z_1561353557_rc2qvm91n6cr_rtrmadp_0_coinbase-ipo.jpg?v=1618411334',)",none
2021-08-22,Business Insider India,Cardano overtakes Binance Coin to become the third largest cryptocurrency — here’s what’s driving the rally,https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/cardano-is-hitting-new-high-as-investors-are-confident-about-its-upcoming-smart-contract-system-alonzo/articleshow/85486235.cms,"Cardano's ADA jumped more than 20% in 24 hours, its highest point since a record of $2.47 on May 16. It is now the third most valuable cryptocurrency .

. The rally in the crypto asset's value is being attributed to an update that will extend the smart contracting mechanism to the blockchain.

It’s often called “ethereum killer” because of its potential of taking on the mightier crypto with an improved smart contracting system.

The new update will open Cardano to the world of DeFi, NFT, and other automated transaction systems.

Cardano has hit a new all-time high, rising over 20% in the last 24 hours, with its price peaking at $2.55. The cryptocurrency that is powering Charles Hoskinson’s public blockchain has regained the spot of being the third-largest crypto with a whopping $80 billion market cap.The Cardano blockchain's cryptocurrency is called ADA, and the system is often touted to be a direct Ethereum and Solana competitor. It has surpassedCoin and is now the third most valuable crypto after Bitcoin and Ethereum.The rally in the crypto asset's value is attributed to the Alonzo Purple public test net launch. It's the final test phase of the project, which will end in the network finally getting smart contracts capability.The entire crypto market has witnessed a bullish rally in the previous week, pushing its market cap to more than $2 trillion. While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to lead the race, new altcoins are constantly challenging the norm. The price dips from the last two months have not seemed to affect the digital asset's price too much, as it's now back well over $2. It reached an all-time high previously in May, remaining just a little shy of $2.5.The upcoming ‘Alonzo’ upgrade is driving the bullish sentiment. The development team announced the launch of the public test net on Twitter. Incorporating smart contracts is critical for the blockchain as it introduces a range of new capabilities such as DeFi (decentralised finance), NFT (non-fungible token), automated lending, and more.The new update is likely to land on September 12, and investors are confident that it'll be a game-changer. Often called the ""ethereum killer,"" it's four times the size of Solana in terms of market cap but has little practical use-case right now.On the flip side, Japanese authorities have permitted it to float on exchanges in the country. While crypto regulations worldwide are at a nascent stage, Japan's decision is also cited as an indirect mark of due diligence and compliance.Smart or blockchain contracts are unique in the way that they ensure compliance between the two parties. Immutability is one of the most remarkable features of a self-executing contract. It means it is impossible to reverse, alter, or tamper the codes, rules, and even the transactions once programmed on the blockchain.Like traditional contracts, smart contracts are agreements between two or more parties, avoiding the need for vigilance or enforcement from third parties.It's self-executing and impossible to reverse, alter, or tamper with the code, internal regulations, and transactions. The blockchain network maintains a transparent, secure, and immutable transaction ledger that ensures proof of ownership is also established and transferable. Contract negotiation and application become far more accessible, and all the edit history of the transaction is also transparently available.Furthermore, it can also be deployed for DAOs (decentralised autonomous organisations), which require communities to be bound to specific rules coded into blockchain contracts combined with governance mechanisms.Ethereum is infamous for its smart contracting ability and was created by Vitalik Buterin and four other co-founders in 2013. Polkadot, EOS, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and many others still compete for the throne, but none of them can defeat the industry's first mover.

Asian countries are outpacing the rest of the globe in terms of cryptocurrency adoption. According to a recent analysis from market research firm Finder, the top five nations in terms of bitcoin ownership are all located in Asia. Most of them were considered unimportant in the cryptocurrency industry; however, a recent study contradicts the same.The Asian country with the highest percentage of cryptocurrency ownership was Vietnam, at 40 per cent, followed by Indonesia, India , Malaysia, and the Philippines, respectively. 30 per cent of individuals polled in Indonesia and India stated that they held cryptocurrency.According to media reports, India also ranked #2 in a poll of nations that use cryptocurrency the most, with 9% of the respondents claiming they used crypto. Meanwhile, the United States and the United Kingdom had the lowest proportion of cryptocurrency owners, with 8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.After the Supreme court ruled out the RBI ban on crypto transactions, there has been a massive increase in retail investors. CoinSwitch Kuber , the largest cryptocurrency platform in India, has onboarded nearly 8 Million users since June 2020.One trend that has been consistent around the globe is that younger people are leading the charge when it comes to cryptocurrency adoption. Young people between the ages of 18 and 34 make for more than 40% of users throughout the world, according to Finders One of the main reasons behind this is the growth of crypto-based companies such as CoinSwitch Kuber, making crypto investing easy and accessible to individuals.The user base also consisted primarily of those aged 35 to 44, with 17 per cent belonging to those in their 45 to 54-year-old. Also, in nations such as Colombia and Netherlands, crypto adoption is seen majorly among the elderly ie, those above the age of 65.Smaller towns in India have been at the forefront of cryptocurrency acceptance in recent years. The increase in user subscriptions from Tier II and Tier III locations on the CoinSwitch Kuber app have grown by over 2000%.Studies show that the adoption of the crypto market has grown by over 880% between June 2020 - June 2021 worldwide and the number of crypto users in India has crossed over 15 million during this time.Recently, there has been a flurry of activity in India’s cryptocurrency space, with the government working towards acting on laws and investors pouring money into crypto companies. Recently, CoinSwitch Kuber raised $25 million in their Series B round from a VC giant named Tiger Global at a $500 million valuation.According to a poll conducted by global consultancy company PwC, India can be among the leaders in the adoption of the overlying blockchain technology that crypto is based on, over the next five years, if an appropriate degree of business and government engagement is achieved.Sharan Nair, the CBO of CoinSwitch Kuber , stated that “The cryptocurrency industry is steaming hot. 2021 has seen an accelerated interest in the crypto space as companies look to gain exposure to the market. Several sectors floundered in FY21, given the challenges of doing business in a pandemic environment. Fintech, for the most part, was not one of them.”Around 15 million Indians are believed to have made investments in private cryptocurrency holdings. Cryptocurrency investments in the nation increased from $923 million in April 2020 to almost $6.6 billion by May 2021, a growth of about 400% in only one year.Following the announcement of a carefully calibrated position on cryptocurrency and digital money earlier in May, the Finance Ministry stated that the world is evolving quickly with technological advances. The possibility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming recognised as an asset class in India has also been floated recently.On the other hand, the central government has stated that Bitcoin or crypto would not be accepted as legal tender shortly.But there is some good news for the crypto community: the government has stated that it would “investigate the application of crypto’s blockchain technology actively to usher in the digital economy.” Instead of outright outlawing cryptocurrencies, the Indian government may impose stringent rules and regulations in their place.For now, the response to crypto in India has been overwhelmingly positive. It is clear that cryptocurrency does have a market in the country, and it is growing exponentially.The above content is non-editorial, and TIL hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, relating to the same.

How did it all begin?

NEW DELHI: The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) - the central bank of China - has heeded the advisory sent by its Shenzhen branch to show zero tolerance to cryptocurrencies.Following the advisory, PBOC has taken ‘cleansing’ operations of 11 companies that used to deal with cryptocurrencies in the Shenzhen region, according to a report in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) that quoted the state-run Shanghai Securities News.However, the authorities have not divulged finer details of how the issue was dealt with.Shenzhen is a global resource centre for computer hardware that includes cryptocurrency mining equipment.In recent times, this region developed into one of the key bases for China’s digital token investment community, the report adds.As a global economy, China had sensed danger from crypto to its economy and money market following traders going overboard with their passion for the digital currency.The authorities had apprehensions that if allowed to grow, cryptocurrency would be a threat to the financial stability of the country. They had targeted Bitcoin and other digital tokens.In February 2021, Shenzhen shut down eight companies for their alleged activities in digital tokens. The Shenzhen branch of PBOC had cracked down on cross-border trading in foreign currencies and stocks which included cryptocurrencies.The Chinese do not distinguish between foreign currency and cryptocurrency. Both are equal in terms of the damage they cause to their economy. But the Chinese financial experts were okay with foreign exchange earned by trading legal currencies.Shenzhen’s move against cryptocurrency shows the mood of the Chinese administration. It became more evident in the last few months after the State Council’s Financial Stability and Development Committee, chaired by Vice-Premier Liu He, announced a further crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading.Two major operators in China – Huobi, and OKCoin cancelled the business license registration of their respective subsidiaries in Beijing.BTCChina, which once ran the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange is quoted in the report saying that it had “completely exited from bitcoin-related businesses” on the mainland.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85484786,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none

Buying crypto coins vs buying shares/bonds:

Trading platforms:

Profit controlling factors:

Volatility and market:

Decentralised vs centralised trading:

NEW DELHI: Ever since the advent of cryptocurrency in 2009 in the trading world, it has grown in popularity at an alarming pace.While cryptocurrency continues to intrigue investors, many people often confuse the crypto market with the stock exchange.Here's listing some of the basic differences between the two.In the stock exchange, shares can be bought and traded in two ways.First, the shares and bonds are listed and sold by companies for the first time in the primary market. Then in the secondary market, those shares and bonds are traded with other investors on stock exchange platforms like BSE or NASDAQ. The prospects of returns and risks are determined by the investment method opted by the investor.In cryptocurrency, trading is done by buying and selling of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum with INR, dollars, pound etc. A crypto asset is firstly bought with local currency and crypto investors directly start exploring and trading for earning profits.The stock exchange market of India has 8 established exchange platforms. Among these, NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) account for maximum trading in the country. In case of cryptocurrency, there are online trading platforms like ZebPay that are rapidly growing and gaining a foothold in India’s nascent crypto market.Both stock exchange and crypto markets are controlled by demand and supply factors created by sellers and buyers. The stock market is additionally affected by a host of factors like political events, natural disasters, sporting events etc. This is due to the interdependence of the banking system and government regulations that regulate the stock market.Crypto exchange is an excitingly lucrative trading option, fraught with risks owing to its budding market. This makes crypto extremely volatile and consequently a source of quick and high returns. In comparison, the stock market is a highly stable, established, and diverse trade market where investment returns are relatively easier to trace and predict.Due to the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies, its operations and transactions can’t be controlled or accessed by the central bank, authorities or manipulated by intermediaries. This decentralization provides great transparency and control to crypto users. However, profits earned by trading assets in crypto are also subject to capital gains tax under the Income Tax act.The stock exchange market in India however works under the centralized regulation of the Reserve Bank Of India (RBI) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to curb mismanagement and prevent fraud.Last but not the least, due to the online mode of operation and absence of strong controls cryptocurrency trading is available 24×7 making it easier and accessible. The stock exchange market has limited access because of strict timings and few extended hours of operation.","('https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-85484589,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-18170,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg',)",none
2021-08-22,NDTV.com,Hackers Steal $97 Million From Japan Crypto Exchange In 2nd Major Heist,https://www.ndtv.com/business/hackers-steal-97-million-from-japanese-cryptocurrency-exchange-liquid-2514915,"Liquid said it had suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals while it assesses the impact of the attac

Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid was scrambling Friday to recover stolen assets worth nearly $100 million, in the second such major heist by hackers in recent days. The Tokyo-based company said in a statement Thursday that it had ""detected unauthorized access of some of the crypto wallets managed at Liquid"".

Elliptic, a London-based firm which helps track stolen cryptocurrencies, said its analysis found ""just over $97 million in cryptoassets have been received by the accounts identified by Liquid as belonging to the thief"".

""Our investigators are also aiding Liquid with tracking the stolen funds,"" Elliptic added in a blog post.

The heist comes after a hacker stole assets worth $600 million last week from cryptocurrency trading company Poly Network, before gradually giving the money back, claiming they had pulled off the theft to highlight a security flaw.

Liquid said it had suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals while it assesses the impact of the attack, although trading was continuing.

Cryptocurrencies have soared in popularity as assets in recent years, despite their volatility and concerns over their environmental impact as trading them requires vast quantities of electricity.

Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies use a technology called blockchain, which ensures that every transaction is recorded.

Thieves trying to steal cryptocurrencies typically move the funds through many different accounts at dizzying speed -- sometimes hundreds of thousands of transactions -- in an attempt to cover their tracks.

However, industry players have grown better at identifying and blocking stolen coins. Liquid said $16.3 million worth of stolen Ethereum had already been frozen ""due to the assistance of the crypto community and other exchanges"".","('https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/2r1h0gng_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg',)",none

Here's What To Know

For many people, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are part of an exciting and lucrative new financial frontier. But for the country's top market watchdog, Gary Gensler, they seem ""like the Wild West"" – and he's promising a crackdown.

The market for cryptocurrencies has ballooned. It is currently estimated to be worth about $2 trillion, thanks to the exploding popularity of Bitcoin and other virtual money like Dogecoin.

Amateur investors, particularly younger ones, have started buying and trading cryptocurrencies, attracted to the thrill of big returns. In the past year, the value of Bitcoin has risen 300%. And cryptocurrencies are increasingly also attractive to traditional investors.

But the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, and even as it becomes more mainstream, it continues to be popular among bad actors.

In recent months, hackers have demanded ransomware payments in Bitcoin, because it is easy to transfer and hard to trace. And there have been plenty of reports of thefts and heists at cryptocurrency exchanges in which cybercriminals have absconded with other people's virtual holdings.

In a recent speech, Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), denounced the lack of transparency and clear regulations, and promised the commission will take action to protect investors, which is a key part of the agency's mission.

""Investors really aren't getting the information to judge the risk, and understand the risk,"" Gensler said. ""If we don't address the issues, I worry a lot of people will get hurt.""

The process is still at the very beginning, but here's what to know.

So, who's Gensler?

Gensler is an experienced regulator, who has worked on Capitol Hill and in the Treasury Department. When he ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration, he played a key role writing and implementing new rules that apply to a segment of the market called derivatives.

Gensler also knows a lot about cryptocurrencies. Most recently, he was a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he focused ""on blockchain technology, digital currencies, financial technology, and public policy."" (One of his courses is available for free online.)

How are cryptocurrencies regulated right now?

The market has developed so fast, regulations haven't kept up. So policymakers have talked about reining in cryptocurrencies under a new regulatory framework for years. But so far, that hasn't happened.

That leaves millions of people who trade cryptocurrencies and assets related to them without clearly defined rules of trading.

It has also complicated life for professional investors and companies that do business with cryptocurrencies. Tiffany J. Smith, a partner at the law firm WilmerHale, who runs a cryptocurrency regulatory practice, helps her clients mitigate risk.

""In the absence of, you know, definitive regulation that applies to crypto assets, we work with them to craft policies, procedures, and processes,"" she says.

So what to expect first?

Clearer definitions is one of the most pressing issues.

Because cryptocurrencies are relatively new, there are not even universally agreed-upon definitions for some of the most basic terms. Can assets being traded on cryptocurrency exchanges be called securities, or are they something completely different? Is Bitcoin a commodity?

This goes beyond semantics; It can determine which regulator has the authority to regulate cryptocurrencies and related assets.

New York University Law School Professor Robert J. Jackson Jr., who used to be an SEC commissioner, says clarity is incredibly important.

""It's past time for regulators to be clear about who is responsible for this, and that clarity will be beneficial to the market,"" he says. ""It will be beneficial to investors. It will even be beneficial to those members of Congress and the other public policymakers who want to know whom to ask, and who to hold accountable for what is going on in those markets.""

What else can we also expect earlier on?

Determining jurisdiction will be critical as well.

So far, the SEC and the CFTC have shared regulatory responsibilities. They have tried to police cryptocurrencies with laws that are already on the books, even though they were really written for other traditional kinds of assets like stocks or bonds.

Smith expects this is likely to continue until there are new, cryptocurrency-specific regulations, meaning regulators will continue to adapt current frameworks for the virtual currency market.

""We are going to see both the SEC and the CFTC using their current authorities to regulate the market as best they can,"" says Smith.

But Gensler has called on Congress to give regulators the authority to write new rules.

He also wants more resources — more money and manpower — to regulate cryptocurrencies. For years, leaders of the SEC and the CFTC have complained that Congress hasn't given them enough money for them to their jobs.

Are there any specific actions expected?

There will be new proposed regulations for sure; It's just not clear in what form.

Gensler has not tipped his hand, and he did not spell out specific actions the SEC might be contemplating during his speech.

But in his speech, Gensler called for the need of ""guardrails,"" or actions intended to protect individual investors, for cryptocurrencies.

So the SEC is likely to take a closer look at aspects like the potential for market manipulation, determining basic rights for amateur investors and bringing in more transparency.

Congress is also proposing new rules. The Senate tucked in a provision to toughen tax enforcement on cryptocurrency players in its recent infrastructure bill, though the final fate remains uncertain given that the House has yet to weigh in.

How does the industry approach regulation?

So far, professional investors say they would actually welcome new regulations – as long as they are not too stringent.

Robert Jackson, the former S.E.C. commissioner, argues regulation will widen the appeal of cryptocurrency assets.

""The market will be better off, because assuring investors that they are getting the kind of transparent pricing they are used to in American markets will encourage other investors to consider the possibility of investing in cryptocurrency,"" he says.

But rules perceived as too stringent will inevitably spark fights. Lobbyists for the cryptocurrency industry tried to fight off Senate rules, calling the tax crackdown too broad.

How will new regulations change cryptocurrencies?

This is a fascinating existential question. Cryptocurrencies were borne of this iconoclastic desire for there to be assets untethered from governments and central banks. No one is really sure what will happen to it when that structure changes.

But many believe new regulations could help cryptocurrencies become a bigger part of our daily lives. For example, some companies, including AMC Theaters, have already announced they will accept cryptocurrencies as payment.","('https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/08/19/gettyimages-1234060979_wide-80455078d37f22a33cb4bc0ced8be44539c83d7b.jpg?s=1400',)",none
