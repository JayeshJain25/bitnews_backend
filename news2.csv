What You Need to Know About Cryptocurrency Stocks - Floridanewstimes.com,"What You Need to Know About Cryptocurrency Stocks

Way back in 2013, Bitcoin was worth only about $100. Since then, it has enjoyed an all-time high price of almost $65,000 per Bitcoin. Even today, Bitcoin is worth almost $50,000 per Bitcoin!

A lot of people became very rich by investing in Bitcoin. Other people who doubted the viability of cryptocurrency quickly changed their minds in response to the huge success of Bitcoin. Now that more people are getting into the cryptocurrency game, they are creating many other coins to compete with Bitcoin.

So which of the less famous cryptocurrency stocks is the best one to invest in? Read on to learn all about how you can find the best investment opportunities in cryptocurrency!

Bitcoin

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and it is still the largest. It has made more millionaires and billionaires than any other cryptocurrency. Many people turn to bitcoin for what they feel is a safe investment.

On the other hand, since Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, it is also not very high tech. Other currencies provide many inancial tools, like smart contracts. In contrast, Bitcoin doesn’t really do anything except act as a medium of exchange.

Ethereum

Ethereum is the second-largest of all cryptocurrencies. It got that way by providing financial tools that Bitcoin didn’t. Ethereum allows for smart contracts.

Smart contracts are contracts that execute themselves without requiring a person to manage the execution. This is much safer than relying on a person to execute a contract since not everybody is trustworthy.

This is especially relevant in some countries where there are not trustworthy insurance companies. Some farmers live without crop insurance because they do not have a local insurance provider that they can trust.

But with the power of smart contracts, farmers can buy contracts and know that they will be honored. Insurance is only one financial tool like this. Ethereum smart contracts are the foundation of dozens of apps and financial tools.

Cardano

Cardano is the third biggest cryptocurrency. It is attempting to replace Ethereum, and maybe even Bitcoin. Ethereum is expensive, while Cardano is cheap. Cardano does not yet offer smart contracts, but it is about to start.

That may allow it to suddenly increase in value, making it a potential investment opportunity.

Of course, the best cryptocurrency stock 2021 has available is not going to always be the best cryptocurrency stock. If you have ever asked, “What is cryptocurrency?”, then one of the first things you should know about cryptocurrency stock prices is that they can change very quickly.

It is important to have tools that allow you to move significant amounts of money in and out of crypto quickly. To learn more about what is cryptocurrency and how you can buy and sell it, check out Byte Federal.

"Counterview: Why Cryptocurrency is a Kardashian, Not Meryl Streep - News18","Investment in currency comes in various shapes and sizes, but they can be broadly whittled down to two propositions: one based on Kim Kardashian, the other on Meryl Streep. Both are well-known celebrities—one new, the other old; one a reality star, the other a talented actor. The new one can drive hype and ‘break the Internet’, the other is a benchmark for acting excellence. One thrives on Instagram and has an army to manage her social media; the other is more nuanced, uses traditional media and has proved her mettle.

Cryptocurrency is the Kardashian of the investment world; you don’t know its intrinsic value but go by the short-term perceptions of a fleeting crowd of this being a hot investment. The value of cryptocurrencies has spiralled up so high that it is recommended as an investment option. To stretch the analogy, if Kim Kardashian were to say “I am Meryl Streep” or better “I am Crypto Streep, which is Meryl and better,” would investors buy that? They normally wouldn’t but that’s happening now—not only is cryptocurrency being seen as the real currency, it’s perceived by some as even better than the real currency as its value keeps going up as more and more people buy into it. Normally, if the value of anything only goes up if more people invest (mine) in it, it is a ponzi scheme.

Several cryptocurrency exchanges sell cryptocurrency as an investment. Normally, an entity selling investment options needs to register as an investment advisor with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). But these cryptocurrency exchanges are bypassing that legal formality of registration or compliance. SEBI is also watching from the sidelines—watching Page One articles and advertisements advising investment in cryptocurrency.

VIEW | RBI Lost Case on Cryptocurrency in Supreme Court, It Must Stop Behaving Like Sore Loser

Whatever be the perception or “sentiment”, the term “cryptocurrency” itself is a misnomer. There is nothing cryptic about it nor is it a currency. The currency bit is added to give credibility to what is basically a token on a general digital ledger. Supporters of cryptocurrency would have us believe that this is the future of currency because it is about technology; technology is inevitable, its march is inexorable, it is inescapable, and India will fall behind the development curve if it ignores technology. The shysters have repeated this argument so many times that the Supreme Court and even Parliament believe that cryptocurrency should be legitimized. This while the savvy investors behind this fake currency are running circles around them. They have even been able to convince Parliament to introduce a bill to ensure that they are a legitimate investment option. The bill is pending approval and it will effectively turn Kim Kardashian into a Meryl Streep. It may not be physically possible but could be legislatively made possible.

Cryptocurrency has to be called what it is—it’s an all-out fake. It’s not even a currency. A currency is real ONLY if it is issued by the central bank. Every other currency with any first name is a fake. Any digital currency being used in India can be a real currency only if it is issued by the RBI. The RBI is issuing a digital currency of its own. One that will have intrinsic value as it will be guaranteed by the central bank as convertible into real rupees. RBI’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will clear the funk around cryptocurrency. Which is why venture capitalists and private investors who have put money into it are trying to sell as much of it to unsuspecting retail investors before it all turns to junk. They are trying to push a bill through Parliament. They are trying to force the Supreme Court to intervene so that the regulator does not ban it. So far, they have been able to confuse enough people into believing that the fake currency is the future as it is about technology. A cryptocurrency is as much about technology as an aluminium manufacturing company is about power. Just because an aluminium company uses power to convert bauxite into aluminium! If a fake currency company uses blockchain technology, how is it about technology? Using technology does not make cryptocurrency real.

Cryptocurrency is not a legal matter for the judiciary; it is a regulatory matter that has to be decided by SEBI and RBI. The central bank decides what is a legal currency in the country, and it has already said that it is progressing with a regulatory structure to make CBDC possible. SEBI has the jurisdiction and the power to prevent all the cryptocurrency exchanges from selling this fake currency as an investment vehicle. It has chosen not to exercise its powers in spite of the confusion all this is creating. It is waiting for a scam to happen—something we saw with the collective investment schemes (CIS) in the past.

Parliament should not pass a bill that will legitimize a fake currency and will create all sorts of challenges for the economy. A fake currency creates a fake economy parallel to the real one, hiding transactions, and hiding them from taxation. Should Parliament be part of an active creation of a parallel economy, only to realize the mistake after they have passed the bill? It is the fervent hope of all right-thinking citizens that the Supreme Court does not allow itself to be persuaded that our central bank does not understand currency; that the Ministry of Finance does not understand the workings of a parallel economy; that the only ones who understand technology, currency, and their importance to an economy are a motley bunch that has been deceiving and sidestepping governments and regulators across the world

NEW DELHI: The rallying cry for using cryptocurrency in the West and Europe could well be about investing in the most lucrative and stable digital asset for long-term investment.But in developing countries, with a shifting economy, people resort to cryptocurrency in dire economic conditions, for sending diaspora remittances or seeking financial relief from spiralling unemployment.Separate surveys - conducted by Statista in March 2021 and Finder and Chainalysis in August 2021 - on cryptocurrency ownership, adoption and usage ranked such developing countries among the top 20.Nigeria in South Africa, Vietnam and Philippines in SouthEast Asia and Venezuela and Argentina in Latin America were key names thrown up by the survey.This country had the highest cryptocurrency usage at 32 percent according to the Statista global survey in March 2021.Stiff regulations and high fees charged on inflowing remittances, made cryptocurrency the obvious choice of Nigerian expatriates for sending money across borders to their families.Strangely, Nigeria’s official records showed a consistent and sharp decline in the remittances inflow from $2.5 billion in January 2021 to $54.4 million in September 2021.However, remittances kept coming in through the private cryptocurrency services. Currently the government plans to launch its own e-naira for replacing cryptocurrency.The economic crisis of this country pales into insignificance in comparison to its indomitable zeal for prospering through cryptocurrency services. It was ranked top in the Chainalysis Adoption Index.Earlier Vietnam’s cryptocurrency usage was dominated by the need to send remittances to families for support, while now it's being diverted for future investment.In September 2021, Vietnam saw a resurgence of crypto mining activity and demand for mining rigs with the price rises of altcoins and Bitcoin . However, crypto mining is still not a regulated activity in Vietnam.The Philippines is among the top five countries in the world to receive remittances from overseas according to the World Bank , with an annual remittance of $32.5 billion.Acknowledging the impact of cryptocurrencies in revolutionizing the country's diaspora remittances and fundraising opportunities, the Central Bank of Philippines approved several crypto exchanges to operate as remittance and transfer companies in the country. The cryptocurrency adoption increased here for both investment and income generation.Fillipinos also constitute 40 percent of over 1 million Axie Infinity gamers. In the face of rampant unemployment post-pandemic, many locals looked up to this as an economic opportunity. Axie Infinity, a crypto-based play-to-earn game, provided relief to the jobless in the Philippines, Brazil and Venezuela.Sky-rocketing inflation in 2020, below $10 minimum wage, and cheap electricity of Venezuela have collectively propelled the crypto boom in this country.Cryptocurrencies are an easy and affordable way for the 5 million Venezuelan diaspora to send remittances home.Cheap power has ushered in flourishing crypto mining activity. Crypto mining has been a regulated activity in Venezuela since November 2020. For those who cannot purchase costly mining machines, getting into the Axie Infinity crypto game through scholarships is another route.This Latin American country languishing in 45 percent inflation, 42 percent poverty and 9.9 per cent GDP contraction in 2020, gained 2 million cryptocurrency users by May 2021. Argentinians have sought refuge in cryptocurrency services and trading from these economic woes.Colombia at 11th and Brazil at 14th in the Chainalysis cryptocurrency adoption index have also geared up for cryptocurrency usage, hedging against various economic problems in these countries.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/from-south-africa-to-latin-america-developing-countries-currently-top-cryptocurrency-usage/articleshow/86313169.cms,2021-09-18,Times of India,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-86313151,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50952,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","Cryptocurrency Live Previous NextHere are their stories:Nigeria:Vietnam:Philippines:Venezuela:Argentina:(For the latest crypto news, investment tips and real-time price updates, follow our.)

Illegal cryptocurrency payments | Washington is preparing to impose sanctions - The Press Stories,"(Washington) Biden management plans to impose sanctions on a number of companies to combat illegal cryptocurrency transactions, such as redemption. The Wall Street Journal Friday.

The US Treasury plans to impose sanctions early next week, the newspaper said.

When asked by AFP, the Treasury did not respond Friday evening.

According to experts quoted by Business Daily, the Treasury Department, which declined to comment on the sanctions targets, should target digital wallets that receive redemption transactions and crypto sites that help convert these amounts.

Beyond these targeted restrictions, the department also seeks to provide new guidance to businesses on the risks associated with facilitating payment after ransomware infections. The guidelines will also impose fines, the newspaper said.

Cybersecurity is one of Biden’s management’s task force after the wave of cyber attacks, especially the use of cryptocurrencies, which revealed major vulnerabilities.

Bitcoin is constantly being criticized by regulators for its illegal uses. The ransom money from businesses or local communities is used by hackers to recover their blocked service.

The spectacular attack on Colonial Pipeline, an American company that disrupted fuel supplies in the United States in early May, provoked a strong reaction from authorities and the recovery of part of the $ 4.4 million recovered in bitcoins.

Later that month, the global meat company JBS was the victim of a cyber attack and offered $ 11 million in ransom to hackers.

Other recent targets in the United States include local communities, hospitals, and insurers. Many of these attacks are said to have been carried out by Russian-based hacker groups with the Kremlin’s indirect consent.

In July, President Joe Biden called on his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to take action against “ransomware” cyber attacks in Russia.

According to a Synolysis report in February, cryptocurrency transactions for illicit purposes reached $ 10 billion in 2020, or 1% of last year’s total cryptocurrency activity.

Binance Prepares Changes to Work With Regulators Worldwide – Bitcoin News - Bitcoin News,"Binance Prepares Changes to Work With Regulators Worldwide

Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, has announced it is preparing changes to be able to work with regulators more closely. Its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, stated the company is ready to apply the needed revisions to transform the exchange into a regulated financial institution in the future. This is Binance’s answer to a series of regulatory issues it has been facing with regulators from all over the world.

Binance Readies Regulator-Friendly Changes

Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, has announced it is preparing changes to better fit the requirements of regulators. The statements were made by Binance’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, in an interview with the South China Morning Post published on September 16, where he hinted at a change in how the institution will treat regulatory matters. He stated:

As we run a centralized exchange, we have come to realize that we need to have a centralized entity to work well with regulators.

This is a clear departure from the policy that Binance had applied before, stating it wasn’t headquartered anywhere in the world because Bitcoin wasn’t either. However, it was this same policy that created problems for Binance with regulators, that have complained about the lack of registration for operation in several countries.

Undoing the Damage

From the interview, it’s clear the recent regulatory problems the exchange has been facing have completely changed Zhao’s vision about how things must be done for compliance purposes. He seemed to toss away his previous beliefs, stating:

We need to have clear records of stakeholders’ ownership, transparency, and risk controls. As the largest player in the industry, we need to prepare ourselves for the shift. We are making changes to make it easier to work with regulators.

This pivot towards compliance is not just empty talk, either. Binance has been actively hiring human resources to step up its compliance game and tighten control over the funds exchanged on its platform. Just yesterday, Binance announced the hiring of Nils Andersen-Röed, a former Europol Dark Web specialist, to further strengthen their investigations and audits team.

Also, last month, Greg Monahan, who was a U.S. Treasury criminal investigator, was appointed as Binance’s Global Money Laundering Reporting Officer, to improve AML policies inside of the exchange.

"Bitcoin Mining Electronic Waste ‘Growing Threat to Environment’, Says Study - Gadgets 360","Mining for bitcoin generates substantial electronic waste that ""represents a growing threat to the environment"", according to a recent study. A co-author of the report told AFP on Friday that the average life cycle of the powerful computers used to unearth the units of the world's leading cryptocurrency was only 1.3 years.

Alex de Vries noted that this was ""extremely short compared to any"" other electronic devices such as iPhones. At 30,700 tonnes, the amount of electronic waste generated by bitcoin mining in the 12 months to May was ""comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the Netherlands"", the report said.

The race to find new bitcoins -- on Friday, one unit was worth more than $47,000 following a stellar rise this year -- means the mining computers' processing power soon becomes obsolete.

And the more bitcoin is worth, the larger the amount of electronic waste, according to the study published by scientific journal, Elsevier.

Alex de Vries works as an economist at the Dutch central bank, while the report's co-author Christian Stoll is from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Despite the high amount of waste, it remains a fraction of the global total from throwing away electronic devices, which stood at 53.6 million tonnes last year.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-mining-electronic-waste-energy-consumption-study-2545088,2021-09-18,Gadgets 360,https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/bitcoin_colours_reuters_1611921415626.jpg,"Mining for bitcoin generates substantial electronic waste that ""represents a growing threat to the environment"", according to a recent study.

Suspected OneCoin Stash Now Under Investigation by Authorities in Seychelles - bitcoinke.io,"A news outlet in Seychelles is reporting that Seychelles Police Financial Crimes Unit has received requests to investigate transactions involving a recent transfer of 230,000 Bitcoins between OneCoin founder, Ruja Ignatova, and several associates.

A news outlet in Seychelles is reporting that the Seychelles Police Financial Crimes Unit has received requests to investigate transactions involving a recent transfer of 230,000 Bitcoins between OneCoin founder, Ruja Ignatova, and several associates.

Victims of the pyramid scheme suspect that the stash is part of the over $4 billion that onecoin has taken from victims or investors in 175 countries. Alongside the bitcoins, it is being reported that Ruja also exchanged cash and property worth over $10 billion with the associates.

In a statement, Jonathan Levy, the Lawyer of the complainants, said:

“The misuse of the Seychelles jurisdiction and involvement of public officials to commit the crypto crime of the century calls into question the use of the Seychelles by other crypto ventures including the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, which makes extensive use of the Seychelles as a corporate headquarters.

If Seychelles lacks the ability to regulate crypto asset transactions worth billions, then there are serious anti-money laundering issues raised about cryptocurrency companies that choose to base their operations there.”

– Lawyer of Complainants

___________________________________________________________________

This request follows claims filed in London, Dublin, and Brussels against the OneCoin organization by victims after $500 million of OneCoin loot was recently discovered in Dubai bank accounts.

OneCoin has become the name of a cryptocurrency ponzi scheme that promised to change the world and take over from bitcoin, taking in at least $4 billion from investors across the world before its Bulgarian founder, Ruja Ignatova, vanished in 2017.

The company initially operated as a multi-level marketing network (MLM) whose main goal was to invest in a new type of cryptocurrency.

OneCoin employed a referral structure to have its many participants attract new actively investing members in exchange for interest. After success with that strategy, it rolled out OneCoin, which it dubbed as a new type of cryptocurrency superior to bitcoin.

The company’s owners claimed that OneCoin could only be mined on servers run by themselves and that the price of the coin was based on the current supply and demand on the market.

The Seychelles Police FInancial Crime Unit indicate that they have received ‘quite a number of documents’ as part of the complaint to investigate OneCoin following the recent movement.

They will have to verify all of them but also point out the difficulty in investigating crypto and offshore facilities:

“We see that the people who have been defrauded have invested on a platform or with International Business Company (IBC).

IBC has a registered agent in Seychelles. Transactions however do not happen here so it is difficult for us to go after the person who has facilitated or committed the crime.”

Head of Legal Affairs, Financial Crimes Investigation Unit (FCIU)

Despite the arrest of CEO, Konstantin Ignatov, in May 2019, and the criminal details that continue to emerge about OneCoin, the scheme still continues to attract new members and ‘mining’ of its coin persists.

"Bitcoin ATM's: What They Are, How They Work, & Where to Find Them - Floridanewstimes.com","Bitcoin ATM’s: What They Are, How They Work, & Where to Find Them

Did you know there are now 42,266 bitcoin ATMs in the US? As the popularity of this crypto currency has grown, so has the technology to make using it easier. But would you know how to operate one?

Luckily, it is just as easy as a standard ATM. Read on as we discuss how to use a bitcoin ATM.

Using a Bitcoin ATM to Buy

The first step is to provide user verification. This will depend on the country or state you are using the machine in. It is often to comply with KYC and AML laws.

After this, scan your Bitcoin wallet. This uses a QR code. Some machines may even print off the code on a receipt for you to use instead of having it onscreen.

In some instances, you may find you can even send Bitcoin to your email address. The email will contain the QR code for scanning via your inbox.

After this, enter the fiat amount you want to spend when buying bitcoin. Cash will then be entered into the machine as if you were depositing in an automated bank.

The machine will take a few minutes to process the transaction and close the sale. Bitcoin should take around ten minutes to an hour to arrive in your wallet. Take the number of the ATM teller in case it does not arrive.

Steps for Selling Bitcoin

Just like buying, the transaction begins by registering and providing user verification if required. After this, you will be asked to select the amount of bitcoin you would like to buy.

The ATM will then prompt you with a QR code. This should be scanned using the wallet on your mobile device. Once it sends, you will get a receipt to confirm the transaction.

The deposit from your wallet can take around ten minutes to an hour, so be patient. This ticket can then be used to withdraw fiat cash from the ATM.

How to Find Bitcoin ATMs

Bitcoin ATMs are now popping up in towns and cities around the world. However, they are not the kind of ATM machine you often stumble across. You can find bitcoin ATM machines in your local area here https://www.bytefederal.com/locations/.

Why EpicHero is the Safemoon of NFT and set to change the whole GameFi space By BTC Peers - Investing.com,"Why EpicHero is the Safemoon of NFT and set to change the whole GameFi space

EpicHero is the biggest 3D NFT War Game on the Binance Smart Chain Network. Collect and build an unstoppable force of characters by choosing from your favorite heroes from Greek, Norse, China, Japan, Egypt, India and Roman Mythology. Users can summon, merge and evolve thousands of Collectable Epic Hero Battle Card NFTs and bring them to the largest arena to do battle against other Epic Heroes.

Moreover, EpicHero is the First Ever play to earn game that rewards its NFT holders with 5% BNB of token transaction and NFT marketplace transaction tax. This innovative mechanism gives the EpicHero NFT holder's great passive income overtime simply by holding the NFT in their wallet.

As the world’s first NFT to give holders reflection rewards in BNB, EpicHero is expected to be a true game changer. You could say, EpicHero is the Safemoon of NFT. EpicHero is the pioneer in this field and is committed to bring more innovative ideas and applications to change the whole GameFi space.

What makes EpicHero special is its 3 killer features, only with EpicHero:

1. World’s first NFT game and the only one until now that gives NFT holders reflection rewards in BNB.

The longer you hold EpicHero 3D NFT, the bigger the amount of dividend you get in BNB.

With highly limited numbers, this feature makes Epic Hero 3D NFT more attractive in the long run because everyone desires to own it.

2. Largest scale battles on BSC with thousands of users each, potentially using thousands of NFTs to compete at the same time to win real money prizes.

3. True 3D NFTs that users are excited to own and show off, each with unique looks and stunning graphics. For the first time, users can fully view their NFT in 3D mode, rotate, zoom in and indulge in a spectacular 360 degree view.

Creating a new hero based on community voting result - Great excitement for international communities

Not only can you choose your favorite heroes from Greek, Norse, China, Japan, Egypt, India, Roman Mythology, but the local community can also vote for the next heroes based on their culture and EpicHero will create a NFT for it!

By connecting Game and Culture, it will be easy to connect and spread players. Imagine what it would be like if a Vietnamese gamer got a Hero like Lac Long Quan or Au Co. And the same for those who are fans of Napoleon, Quanyu, Naruto.

No borders, no restrictions on creativity, the number of 3D NFTs that can be created is endless. As long as the culture has appeared on Earth, EpicHero will be able to bring it into the game.

Why should I invest in EpicHero?

The answer by the team is simple, EpicHero is the Safemoon of NFTs. EpicHero has something that no other projects until now has had, which will benefit EpicHero NFT holder's long term:

1. NFT reflection rewards in BNB: Since EpicHero offers the world's first reflection rewards NFT, it means the longer you hold your NFT the bigger the amount of dividend you get in BNB, it give holders the incentive to hold to collect dividend and with highly limited numbers, this feature makes the NFT look more attractive in the long run because everyone desires to have it.

2. Not only is Epic Hero NFT highly limited in numbers, but also it will become rarer and rarer day by day because of the NFT merging (burning) mechanism. Users can choose 2 heroes to merge into a new one with better attributes or rarity, so the number of heroes will be decreased a lot over time.

These 2 mechanisms make sure that holding Epic Hero NFT brings more and more value in the long run for its holders. The project has also been thoroughly audited by Thoreum Auditing team, and the audit by RugFreeCoins returned 0 issues.

Backing EpicHero through the rain or shine is their strategic investor Thoreum, who has very strong financial as well as user base support. They have a famous community of diamond hands investors. Through the hard times in the journey with Thoreum they have learned about how to invest in a long-term x100 potential project like Thoreum and the team believe they can have the support from them over here at Epic Hero.

Thoreum already has 20 local groups with a total of 140,000 members, including Indonesia, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Iran and others, which EpicHero has gained immediate exposure to. Thoreum’s huge network spans the entire globe, across their telegram pages interacting with hundreds of thousands of people from various nationalities, religions, languages and ethnicities.

Thoreum is very strong in marketing and massive advertising has already begun. USD 200,000 has already been spent to advertise EpicHero everywhere on BSCscan, Poocoin, Coinzilla, BSCNetwork, PlaytoEarn.net, BSCNews, with famous influencers on Twitter (NYSE: ), and multiple AMAs with investment groups and media partners. This is just prior to the launch of EpicHero, with further activities and investments to come.

Special care has been taken to attract the clients from all those various backgrounds you mentioned. All are welcome at Epic Hero and communities look forward to gathering in the largest Battle Ground On the Binance Smart Chain.

Long term development & long term benefit for investors is EpicHero’s main target, which is also why EpicHero chose to be a strategic partner with Thoreum, the project that has been battle tested and has the right recipe for resilient long term growth, even in bearish periods of the market.

It's a combination of built in strengths of the tokenomics, multiple innovative use cases, talented & dedicated team, focus on delivering a SAFU project, and strong, proactive marketing.

For EpicHero's long-term growth, a burn mechanism is in place with 1% built-in burn in each transaction, therefore the more time the token is in circulation the fewer tokens there are and the rarer they become. EpicHero also have reserve funds like Thoreum's 5,000 bnb Thor Thunder, that’s the best warranty during a bear market.

Not only is Epic Hero NFT highly limited in numbers, but also it will become rarer and rarer day by day because of EpicHero’s NFT merging (burning) mechanism. User can choose 2 heroes to merge into a new 1 with better attributes or rarity, so the number of heroes will be decreased a lot over time.

The multiple use cases, from play2earn, collecting to simply holding for passive income, makes EpicHero friendly to anyone, and attractive in various states of the market.

Bitcoin mining generates substantial electronic waste: study - eNCA,"LONDON - Mining for bitcoin generates substantial electronic waste that ""represents a growing threat to the environment"", according to a recent study.

A co-author of the report told AFP that the average life cycle of the powerful computers used to unearth the units of the world's leading cryptocurrency was only 1.3 years.

Alex de Vries noted that this was ""extremely short compared to any"" other electronic devices such as iPhones.

At 30,700 tonnes, the amount of electronic waste generated by bitcoin mining in the 12 months to May was ""comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the Netherlands"", the report said.

The race to find new bitcoins -- on Friday, one unit was worth more than $47,000 following a stellar rise this year -- means the mining computers' processing power soon becomes obsolete.

And the more bitcoin is worth, the larger the amount of electronic waste, according to the study published by scientific journal, Elsevier.

Alex de Vries works as an economist at the Dutch central bank, while the report's co-author Christian Stoll is from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Despite the high amount of waste, it remains a fraction of the global total from throwing away electronic devices, which stood at 53.6 million tonnes last year.",https://www.enca.com/news/bitcoin-mining-generates-substantial-electronic-waste-study,2021-09-18,eNCA,https://www.enca.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/afp/2021-09/doc-9N26V4-%40photo0.jpg?h=426933fc&itok=fJOeaqFY,"LONDON - Mining for bitcoin generates substantial electronic waste that ""represents a growing threat to the environment"", according to a recent study.

British businessman says: 'I lost R$ 3.6 million in a Bitcoin scam' - Mediarun Search,"44-year-old British businessman Naveed Al-Saghir is a graduate and masters in computer science. He also successfully runs his own home theater installation business in the North West of England.

After a lifetime of hard work, regular savings and wise investments, earlier this year he saved the equivalent of 3.6 million BRL in bitcoins.

However, he was scammed by online fraudsters who stole all his money.

“It ruined my life, changed for the worse, and I need to warn people: If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone,” Naveed says.

He now has a mission.

Struggling to cope with the emotional damage of seeing her plans fizzle out with a ruined financial future, she wants to share her story in an effort to prevent others from becoming victims.

“I’ve been running my business for 20 years and have always been very careful about money,” he explains.

“Whether it was for my work or my life, I made every penny worth. But I made the wrong decision.”

“False Investments”

Naveed was the victim of a type of fraud known as an ‘investment scam’.

This happens when victims are deceived into giving money to people who offer fake but often disguised investments with the promise of big profits.

“I was watching YouTube videos when I came across an ad offering an opportunity to invest in stocks and filled out a form asking for more information.”

“The next day, I got a call from someone who introduced themselves as a customer service agent and paid $350 ($1,800) to start investing.”

“The next day they called me again, this time there was someone who described himself as my account manager and gave me a username and password for a very attractive business website.”

Naveed paid his first payment at the end of May. This was the first act of a nightmare that would cause his financial collapse.

The scammers soon made him believe new lies, promising even greater profits. When he began to lose money, he was convinced that he would get it back in full and in larger quantities.

At the end of August, Naveed handed over $25,000 (131,000 BRL) and 14.25 BTC, worth about $690,000 (BRL 3.6 million), according to the cryptocurrency’s current value.

“I still can’t remember how they managed to trick me,” Naveed says. “I do not know”.

In the UK, several NGOs have called for fraudulent advertising to be included in the Online Security Act, which will soon be considered in the British Parliament.

The Institute for Monetary Policy and Mental Health has warned that millions of Internet users, especially those with mental health issues, are at risk of losing money or sensitive personal information to fraudsters.

justice?

Lisa Forte, who works for cybersecurity firm Red Goat Cyber ​​Security, says that not only is Naveed unlikely to get some of her money back, but that she will see justice served.

“Even if the police start an investigation, which is unlikely, even if they find the criminals responsible, which is highly unlikely, what should they do when the criminals are in another country where the British police have no jurisdiction?”

“There is practically no case to go back to with regards to bitcoin. It is a form of currency that operates outside the purview of ‘normal’ money and so, because it is unregulated, consumer protection simply does not exist.”

Forte recommends three things people can do to try to protect themselves and prevent their family and friends from becoming victims.

“First, research everything you do to position your assets. There are many reliable sources.

secondly, understand what bitcoin is, as it should be in any investment; Research how it works and learn the pros and cons.

Third, if someone says that they can use their investment to make a big profit in a short period of time, this is the time to start the alarm. Legitimate investment platforms don’t make that kind of promise.”",https://www.mediarunsearch.co.uk/british-businessman-says-i-lost-r-3-6-million-in-a-bitcoin-scam/,2021-09-18,Mediarun Search,https://www.mediarunsearch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mediarun-Search-Favicon-150x133.png,"44-year-old British businessman Naveed Al-Saghir is a graduate and masters in computer science.
