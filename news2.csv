"An investor's guide to Cardano, which has mysteriously become the No. 3 crypto in the world - CNBC","Ether, the digital token of the Ethereum blockchain, is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market value.

The Cardano blockchain's ada token, the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko, hit an all-time high Thursday of $3.09, after breaking past $3 on Wednesday.

The surge in demand for the altcoin comes amid renewed interest in NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and continued enthusiasm for DeFi, or decentralized finance.

2 programmers estimate billions of dollars worth of bitcoin is recoverable - Markets Insider,"Charlie and Chris Brooks run Crypto Asset Recovery, a small business in New Hampshire. Crypto Asset Recovery

A father and son team of computer programmers help people find lost passwords to their crypto wallets.

Chris and Charlie Brooks conducted an analysis that led them to estimate between 68,110 and 92,855 seemingly lost bitcoins are recoverable.

At current prices, the high end of the recoverable bitcoin estimate amounts to $4.7 billion.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

For Chris and Charlie Brooks, finding lost passwords to cryptocurrency wallets requires figuring out how their clients' minds work - and that effort can help their customers retrieve a slice of what the pair estimates is about $4.7 billion worth of recoverable bitcoin stranded in locked wallets.

""We get a really broad spectrum of clients. We have a client who is an early-stage miner in bitcoin who lost all of his information and he knows he's got some bitcoins somewhere … We get clients who were told in 2017 to buy into the hype-bubble and they bought $1,000 [worth] and they are looking for something to cover the rent,"" Charlie, a 20-year-old computer programmer who joined his father in running Crypto Asset Recovery based in New Hampshire, told Insider in a video interview.

""One of our most recent cracks had about $250,000,"" in a blockchain wallet, said Charlie, who majored in computer science in college. He's put school aside for now to work at the business. ""This is something I've always liked. I would follow along with my dad ... Online treasure hunting, it seemed really cool.""

Nearly 40% of 1,000 US crypto owners in a recent survey from Cryptovantage said they had lost wallet passwords and, on average, those unable to find their passwords lost $2,134.

The jumping-off point of the duo's estimate of what can be recovered was a Chainalysis estimate that up to 20% of 18.5 million existing bitcoin appear to be lost or stranded in locked wallets. The figures were cited in January by The New York Times in a story about a San Francisco-based programmer who couldn't find the password to the hard drive that stored his 7,002 bitcoin. After eight wrong guesses, he had two left to figure out the password before the virtual currency was likely lost forever.

The Chainalysis figure sparked a question for the Brookses.

""Yes, that bitcoin is lost but if the owner of that bitcoin were motivated, what percentage of those do we think is reasonable to assume could be recovered?,"" said Chris, a 50-year-old computer programmer who started his business in 2017 and, after some time retooling, ramped up operations late last year when his son came on board.

Nakamoto's forum

To find a sample of lost bitcoin for their analysis, Chris said they turned to a thread on BitcoinTalk, a forum whose creation is credited to bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. A thread started in 2011 called ""Let's add up the KNOWN lost bitcoins"" is filled with posts by people with the amount of bitcoin they lost and how it happened. The Brookses filtered and set parameters on the information, such as excluding losses of less than half of a bitcoin, to make an estimate on the sample population of the bitcoin reported lost.

The Brookses narrowed it all down to 72 posts that described the loss of at least half of a bitcoin. They determined that 14% are potentially recoverable cases and that from their own work in recovering wallets for clients, they can decrypt about 35% of passwords. That led to their conclusion that about 2.45% of lost bitcoin is retrievable. With a range between 68,110 and 92,855 bitcoins, that would make up to $4.7 billion in bitcoin recoverable based on the asset's price of about $50,372 on Friday.

Good guesses

""We get as good a list of passwords as we can from a client and then we put our heads together and spend some time extrapolating the way that they make their passwords and try to get in their mind when they are actually creating a password,"" said Charlie. ""That's the most helpful thing, just seeing their practice,"" he said. ""That's the cornerstone of our business, essentially.""

The duo will run ""hundreds of millions or billions of variations"" of password patterns and test those against the encrypted version of the wallet, said Chris.

""If you don't have a very good [password] guess, there are more possible passwords than there are atoms in the universe, and I'm not being facetious when I say that,"" Chris said.

The Brookses said decrypting times vary but occasionally can take as little as five seconds. That happened with a client whose list of nine potential passwords contained the correct one. Charlie said they worked for roughly a month and a half with the client who turned out to have about $250,000 in his wallet.

Security measures they take include having clients sign a contract stating they are the owner of the blockchain wallet being worked on. The two get paid on a sliding scale. Starting with wallets containing between zero and 10 bitcoins, or an equivalent value, the team will earn a 20% commission. There's no charge to clients if they can't recover any funds.

Chris said a number of their clients live in countries where people are largely unbanked.

""They may have a wallet with a couple of hundreds of dollars in it and that is their life savings. If they lose the password to it, they have no access to it anymore,"" said Chris. ""In some sense, it can be a heartbreaking piece of the business … we do crack some of [the wallets]. It's a balancing act to be helpful without going too far down a rabbit hole.""",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/locked-crypto-wallet-password-recovery-cryptocurrency-chris-charlie-brooks-btc-2021-9,2021-09-04,Markets Insider,https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/6131ff9dee41b9001972273f?format=jpeg,none

HODLers would like to use their Bitcoins, Ethereum, and other popular cryptocurrencies to purchase mainstream products, such as real estate, cars, and electronic gadgets. Exeno unveils the results of its market survey of cryptocurrencies adoption.

65% of customers are ready to spend their cryptocurrency on popular goods.

Real estate, cars, electronic gadgets are at the top of the list of desired products for cryptocurrency transactions.

32% of respondents declare investing in cryptocurrencies as their retirement saving instruments.

Exeno.com is an innovative global online store. The platform allows customers to pay for selected goods with Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and novice Bitcoin Vault with no FIAT conversions. People from all over the world can use their digital coins to quickly and securely purchase popular products ranging from electronics, cosmetics, sports accessories to travel gear.

Exeno organized a survey to study cryptocurrency holdings and the spending patterns of modern customers. The research was part of the effort to explore the role of cryptocurrency in people’s lives and identify what should be done to improve the online shopping experience.

People are ready to buy products with cryptocurrency

The respondents were asked whether they would buy goods such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and game consoles with cryptocurrency. Two-thirds gave an affirmative answer: 65% of respondents are ready to buy these goods for their cryptocurrency. Most customers find cryptocurrency to be an attractive payment method.

Cryptocurrencies’ main advantage over FIAT money seems to lie in its politically independent nature. Fifty-four percent of respondents are open to using their cryptocurrency to buy real estate, 45% to buy cars, and 33 % to acquire electronic gadgets (respondents were allowed to give more than one answer).

Buying luxurious, expensive things with cryptocurrency seems to be a common strategy, likely due to exchange rate fluctuations offering an opportunity to make a purchase at a low price point. Regarding the frequency of and rationale for spending cryptocurrency, 21% of respondents would use their cryptocurrency for major purchases; 28% are considering using cryptocurrency as a regular payment method.

Why do some people still avoid shopping with cryptocurrency?

Although 65% of the respondents are open to shopping with cryptocurrency, only 22% have done so. The prevailing cause was simply the lack of shops accepting such payments: 36% of respondents pointed to popular stores not honoring cryptocurrency. Twenty-four percent were apprehensive about going through complex procedures required from cryptocurrency users. Nineteen percent are wary of high exchange rates and 14% of high commissions.

Twenty-three percent of respondents are planning to spend their cryptocurrency in the very near future (‘right now’), and another 32% are ready to take this step within the next 1-3 years. Thus, the survey suggests that 55% of cryptocurrency holders are likely to be looking for stores accepting cryptocurrency payments. Only 8% declared the intent to HODL their digital coins for 10 years or more.

The survey results show a clear upward trend in the popularity of cryptocurrencies as a payment method. Such players as Exeno see this potential with a growing number of cryptocurrencies transactions every day. The research was conducted in June and July 2021. Participants answered 10 multiple-choice questions via an anonymous online form.

New law set to transform cryptoverse & how! - Economic Times,"The Cryptocurrency Bill is still awaiting Cabinet approval and tabling in Parliament. Not much is known about the contents of the bill. This has been making many people nervous in the cryptoverse – the expanding universe of all crypto investors, players, dealers, enthusiasts, platforms and app developers.this week reported that through the bill the government may finally come clear on many questions surrounding the cryptoverse. This is a welcome development and may spur a lot of economic activity and innovations around cryptos. Apart from that, there may be follow-through acceptance happening in many other areas like state laws and various policy frameworks.As a starting point, the bill will have to define what may qualify as a valid crypto. This itself may be a good beginning, as it may set a benchmark standard for inclusion (or exclusion) of a crypto asset.Depending on how the bill defines crypto and how its treatment follows from that in terms of taxation and regulation, the cryptoverse may choose their play. If they find the definition and ensuing rules etc favourable to their businesses, they may want to position their products as valid cryptos. Should the definitions etc be non-conducive, they may choose not to identify them as cryptos at all.There is a lot of innovation yet to happen in the industry, and therefore notwithstanding the level of clarity in the definition, there will be an expected grey area for a few years to come – something that may even be good for innovation to prosper.One thing that the government and RBI have been clear and consistent about is that they would not accept any crypto as part of the payment and settlement framework. So, we are definitely not going to see cryptocurrency coming up as a valid tender for payments. Instead, the bill itself may enable RBI to create a crypto equivalent of the country’s fiat currency, also called as Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). RBI has been working on its CBDC project and its rollout is expected by the end of the year. This, however, will depend on the crypto bill being passed by Parliament before that.The cryptoverse has been seeking to settle for the next best thing – being accepted as a Digital Asset or a Commodity . Asreported, the government definition of an asset itself is in question, as there is no hard and fast definition of an asset so far. That said, the Income-Tax department does define what is a capital asset. In simple terms, it essentially defines a capital asset as one, whose future value may not be ascertained at present. The cryptoverse may itself need to define what constitutes an 'asset' before further defining a 'Digital Asset'. All this clarity may spur innovation at every level and also determine the choice of classification based on end-use.The bill may classify the cryptos as commodity or digital asset. Even after they get their class recognition, cryptos will need to be regulated (or not) based on the end use of the product or the platform. It has also been debated whether the cryptos must be regulated uniformly under one set of regulations. This, however, may not be possible.The most known cryptos are Bitcoin and Ether – owing to the interest in their trading and ever-increasing values. While these cryptos have been the torch-bearers of the technology, most of them were originally created to become functional payment vehicles and, therefore, the name cryptocurrency. While they could not become acceptable cryptocurrencies, the world has adapted to use them as new trading vehicles and slowly they have become ‘digital assets’ whose value keeps on changing based on demand and supply. These cryptocurrency tokens inherently do not represent anything specific.On the other hand, there are more specific purpose cryptos that represent an underlying value or ownership of something. As an example, my own company RealX has been waiting on these regulations to explore if there can be a legitimate case for tokenizing real estate – essentially creating a digital asset (crypto) -- that represents ownership of a certain property. There is a new craze for something called NFTs (non-fungible tokens). An NFT essentially is another example of a ‘digital asset’ and represents the ownership of any item – it may be physical items like a real painting or even digital items like a song or copyright to an intellectual property. Similarly, there can be tokenisation of revenue streams coming from investment in solar installations or trade receivables.The cryptoverse is only going to expand its horizons with more legitimacy and clarity in regulations. While the underlying technology behind them may be conceptually similar, the implementations and their end use may be vastly different. Therefore, it is simply not possible to regulate all of these under one umbrella law.The crypto bill must, however, set some common benchmarks on what may be a valid crypto and what may be a valid crypto transaction. Such common minimum compliance must apply to all crypto tokens and may be looked at as an extension of the Information Technology Act, specifically applicable to ‘digital assets’.It may be possible to categorise the generic cryptos (originally called cryptocurrencies) as commodities, while many specific application cryptos that represent something of value may be classified as digital assets.The cryptocurrency bill may be a gamechanger for the country. It may spur large-scale innovation and application of cryptos as a technology into multiple applications where ‘digital assets’ can be created. The pandemic has left the government looking at more sources of revenues and it may expect some of it to be filled in through the direct and indirect revenues generated through regularisation of cryptos. It will also leapfrog India from being a nation reluctant in crypto adoption to an innovation powerhouse in digital assets.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/new-law-set-to-transform-cryptoverse-how/articleshow/85924303.cms,2021-09-04,Economic Times,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85924330,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43832,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",none
"What is the Wifedoge? Meet the cryptocurrency 'wife' of Dogecoin that grew more than 3,000% in one day and Elon Musk already 'liked' it - Beaumont Enterprise","Last July they launched the cryptocurrency Wifedoge , which is presented as the 'wife' of Dogecoin , but in essence it is a clone of it. In addition to being a curiosity of the 'crypto' world and having the 'like' of Elon Musk , the token surprised everyone this week with a growth of more than 3,000% in market capitalization in just one day, according to data from CoinMarketCap .

This Tuesday, August 31, the Wifedoge exceeded 2.32 million dollars in market capitalization , a figure 3,294.29% higher than the 68,350 dollars with which it began on Monday morning.

It may interest you: The Dogecoin increased its value by 4,600% in one year and Elon Musk gives it another push

However, the 'wife' of the Dogecoin failed to sustain the streak and for this Thursday, September 2, its capitalization fell to $ 301,406 .

What is the Wifedoge?

Wifecoin represents the 'inception' of cryptocurrencies , as it emerged as a parody of a digital currency (the Dogecoin ), which in turn was inspired by a meme to parody Bitcoin , so surreal!

The creators ensure that the value of each Wifecoin token will be equivalent to one Dogecoin . Excellent news, considering that the DOGE increased its value by 4.600% in one year and both Elon Musk and Mark Cuban see it as the “strongest” cryptocurrency.

In addition, they announced that they would reserve 5% of the Wifedoge units for Elon Musk .

""We will give them to you at the right time, otherwise 5% of the tokens will be forever blocked,"" reads a tweet from the Wifecoin account.

In fact, the developers of the new cryptocurrency 'meme of the meme' are so sure they have the endorsement of Elon Musk , that they thanked him for his support on Twitter.

Thank you Elon Musk. I am Wifedoge. Doge's wife! Now is the fourth launch day on Pancakeswap! Thanks for tweeting to cheer on Wifedoge. Trust us, we will soon surprise global investors even more. Our team is working hard, ” reads another tweet.

Should you invest in Wifedoge?

Experts assure that these vertiginous 'ups and downs' are caused by fraudulent manipulations of the crypto market, which generates multiple victims.

""The sharp ups and downs in the price of low liquidity assets are often the result of fraudulent manipulations known as 'pump and dump' and that consist of inflating their value and then selling it at overstated prices. The lack of regulations in the crypto market causes many investors become victims of this scheme, "" said RT en Español .

The decision to invest or not in Wifedoge is like with any other cryptocurrency : if you have extra money that you are willing to lose in case things go wrong, then go for it. It never hurts to have some tokens in your cryptocurrency portfolio that could skyrocket more than 3,000% in 24 hours .

Where to Buy Crypto – Full Broker Reviews

You will need to research carefully when it comes to choosing a cryptocurrency broker. This is because there are many platforms in this industry that are based offshore and thus – do not have the legal remit to serve US clients. In addition to safety, you also need to consider what crypto markets the broker supports and how much you will be charged to invest.

To save you from having to perform countless hours of research yourself, we have pre-vetted a small selection of top-rated brokers that allow you to safely invest in cryptocurrency in the US.

1. eToro – Overall Best Place to Invest in Cryptocurrency

eToro is a popular brokerage firm that offers a wide range of asset classes. When it comes to cryptocurrency, you will find a huge selection of markets to choose from. This includes large-cap digital assets like Bitcoin, XRP, Litecoin, EOS, and Ethereum. Other popular markets include AAVE, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Decentraland. Regardless of which token takes your interest, eToro allows you to invest in cryptocurrency from just $25. This is the case irrespective of how much the individual crypto asset is worth in the open marketplace.

For example, let’s suppose that you are interested in Bitcoin – which at the time of writing, is trading at almost $50,000 per token. If you decided to invest $500 into this digital asset at eToro, you would own 1% of one Bitcoin. This is because eToro supports fractional ownership – meaning that you can invest any amount of your choosing as long as you meet the stipulated minimum of $25. By choosing eToro as your go-to cryptocurrency broker, you will also benefit from some very competitive fees.

The way eToro works is that the broker operates on a spread-only basis – meaning that your fee amounts to the mark-up between the buy and sell price. This starts at just 0.75% at eToro – although this can vary depending on the crypto asset and wider market conditions. While we are on the discussion of fees, eToro allows you to deposit funds without paying any transaction charges. The minimum deposit amount is just $50 and you can add funds to your account via a bank transfer or debit/credit card.

A popular feature at eToro is the Copy Trading tool – which is ideal for newbies with little to no experience of cryptocurrencies. This is because you will be ‘copying’ a successful trader like-for-like – so any cryptocurrencies that they buy will also be reflected in your own eToro portfolio. The Copy Trading tool requires a minimum investment of just $500 and you won’t need to pay any additional commissions or fees. You might also consider the CryptoPortfolio at eToro – which offers a basket of digital tokens at various weights.

This is managed by the in-house eToro team – so it’s yet another way to invest in cryptocurrencies in the US on a purely passive basis. We briefly mentioned earlier that there are many illegitimate brokers in the cryptocurrency scene. You shouldn’t have this concern at eToro, as the broker is approved by the SEC and FINRA to operate in the US. Furthermore, the broker is authorized and regulated by CySEC, ASIC, and the FCA. You can get started at eToro in under five minutes by opening an account, depositing funds, and choosing the cryptocurrency you wish to invest in!

2. Coinbase – Best Way to Invest in Cryptocurrency for Beginners

Coinbase is arguably one of the best-known cryptocurrency brokers in the US. The broker is heavily regulated and carries a superb reputation – especially with beginners. You don’t need to have any prior experience of cryptocurrencies to use Coinbase – as the platform is very simple to use. In fact irrespective of whether you invest online or via the Coinbase app – you should be able to complete the process in under 10 minutes. Perhaps the easiest way to invest in cryptocurrencies at Coinbase is to use your Visa or MasterCard debit card.

This will allow you to complete your purchase instantly. But, you will first need to upload a copy of your ID – as per KYC rules. The fee applied to instant debit card investments at Coinbase is 3.99% of the transaction amount. If your investment is less than $200 – you will pay a flat commission which actually works out more expensive. If you elect to deposit funds via a local bank transfer, it might take 1-2 working days to arrive. But, not only will you benefit from a fee-free deposit, but you’ll pay a reduced trading commission of 1.49%.

When it comes to supported digital assets, Coinbase is home to dozens of cryptocurrencies. This includes a good blend of markets – so Coinbase is suitable for creating a diverse portfolio of blockchain assets. For example, not only can you invest in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum – but a full host of ERC-20 tokens. In terms of storing your crypto investment safely, you can do this directly on the Coinbase website. The broker offers several security features – such as cold storage (98%), two-factor authentication, and device whitelisting.

3. Binance – Best Place to Invest in Cryptocurrency for Asset Diversity

While some investors in the US will look to stick with the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, others will look to dive much deeper into this industry. By this, we mean diversifying into a range of digital currencies across various market capitalizations and risk spectrums. For example, you might decide to add some large-cap tokens to your portfolio – such as Litecoin, Dogecoin, and EOS, alongside a selection of DeFi (decentralized finance) and ERC-20 tokens. Either way, if diversification if your main priority – Binance is one of the best brokers for the job.

In a nutshell, Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume. It often facilities close to $100 billion in daily trading activity – which is huge. With that said, the exchange has since launched a bespoke website aimed specifically at Americans who wish to invest in cryptocurrency in a safe and regulated environment. This will give you access to 50 cryptocurrencies that can be purchased instantly with a debit or credit card. The fee charged by Binance on instant investments stands at just 0.5%.

4. Robinhood – Invest in Cryptocurrency via a Regulated Mobile App

If you are interested in the US stock markets, then you might have previously come across Robinhood. The brokerage firm is well-known in the US for its user-friendly and low-cost stock trading facilities – which is particularly attractive to retail investors. With that said, Robinhood also offers a cryptocurrency investment division that covers a small selection of popular tokens. This includes Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin.

Naturally, such a small portfolio of digital currencies does mean that Robinhood won’t be suitable for those of you looking to invest in a diverse range of crypto assets. However, if you are looking to invest in one of the cryptocurrencies mentioned above, you can do so on a commission-free basis. We should note that commission-free crypto investing at Robinhood doesn’t mean that you are not paying any fees. On the contrary, you will indirectly pay for your cryptocurrency purchase via the spread.

This is the difference between the buy and sell price of the cryptocurrency in question – and this can amount to well over 1% depending on the asset and current market conditions. On the flip side, it is notable that Robinhood supports fractional cryptocurrency purchases – so you can invest as little as you wish. Robinhood is heavily regulated in the US – so there will be no issues with safety. The brokerage site will ultimately appeal to those of you that wish to have an investment account that allows you to access both cryptocurrencies and traditional stocks.

Pros

Hugely popular broker in the US

5. Webull – Invest in Cryptocurrency From Just $1

Webull is often viewed as a direct market competitor to Robinhood. This is because both brokerage firms target the average retail investor that might be looking to trade financial instruments for the very first time. Both also claim to offer 0% commissions on all supported markets. In the case of Webull, while you will not pay any commission to invest in cryptocurrency in the US – you do need to be mindful that spreads start at 1%. The minimum cryptocurrency investment at Webull is just $1 – which is great for those of you on a budget.

We found that Webull offers a relatively wide selection of cryptocurrencies – all of which can be accessed on the main desktop platform or the iOS/Android app. For example, you can trade everything from Cardano, Stellar, and Ethereum Classic to Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin. These markets are operational 7 days per week – so you can enter and exit the market as you please. Webull accounts are quick and easy to open, and there is no minimum deposit requirement.

You will not be able to fund your account with a debit/credit card – as Webull only accepts ACH and bank wires. You will pay $8 per deposit when opting for a bank wire and $25 on withdrawals. You can, however, deposit and withdraw funds for free when electing to use ACH. All in all – and much like Robinhood, Webull is probably the best option for US clients that wish to combine cryptocurrency and stock/fund investments via a single account. And of course – Webull is heavily regulated in the US – so you shouldn’t have any issues regarding safety and security.

Pros

User-friendly trading app for both iOS and Android devices

How to Invest in Cryptocurrency – Detailed & Explained in Full

Towards the top of this guide, we ran you through a quickfire overview of how to invest cryptocurrency in under five minutes. However, if you’re looking to invest in this marketplace for the first time – you might require a more comprehensive walkthrough.

If this is the case – below we explain how to invest in cryptocurrency in the US at eToro – a regulated and low-cost broker that is aimed at newbies.

Step 1: Open a Cryptocurrency Investment Account

To get the ball rolling, head over to the eToro homepage and open an account. You can do this with ease by clicking the ‘Join Now’ button and entering your personal information as prompted. This covers the basics – such as your name, nationality, date of birth, home address, and social security number.

eToro also needs to collect your cell phone number and email address – both of which need to be verified. You will also need to choose a username and password.

Cryptoassets are highly volatile unregulated investment products. Proceed at your own risk.

Step 2: Upload ID

Not only is eToro approved in the US by the SEC and FINRA – but it is also regulated by financial bodies in Europe and Australia. Taking all of this into account – eToro is required to run you through a quick KYC (Know Your Customer) process before you can begin to invest in cryptocurrencies.

For this, you’ll need a copy of your government-issued ID. You will also need to provide proof of residency – such as a bank statement or utility bill. Once you upload the aforementioned documents, the eToro will verify them in 1-2 minutes.

Step 3: Deposit Funds

The next step is to deposit some funds – so that you can proceed to invest in your chosen cryptocurrency. eToro allows US clients to deposit money via a debit/credit card (Visa, MasterCard, Maestro) or bank transfer. The minimum deposit requirement is just $50.

Best of all, eToro doesn’t charge US clients any transaction fees on deposits. This is in stark contrast to platforms like Coinbase or Coinmama – which charge 3.99% and 5% on debit card transactions, respectively.

Step 4: Search for Cryptocurrency

If you already know which cryptocurrency you want to invest in, it’s best to use the eToro search box. In our example, we are looking to invest in Ethereum – the world’s second-largest digital currencies in terms of market capitalization.

However, if you need a little bit of inspiration as to which cryptocurrencies to invest in, it’s best to explore what’s on offer before proceeding. You can do this by clicking the ‘Trade Markets’ button on the left-hand side – followed by ‘Crypto’.

Step 5: Invest in Cryptocurrency

When you are ready to complete your cryptocurrency investment at eToro – click the ‘Trade’ button. You will then see a user-friendly order box – such as the one in the image below.

The only thing you need to do here is to tell eToro how much money you wish to invest into your chosen cryptocurrency – which should be stated in US dollars. All supported digital currencies come with a minimum investment of just $25 at eToro.

Finally, click on the ‘Open Trade’ button to complete your investment. Within seconds, the order will be executed at the next best available price. You can then head over to the ‘Portfolio’ area of your account to see your newly purchased digital tokens!

How to Sell Cryptocurrency

Perhaps one of the biggest barriers of entry for newbie cryptocurrency investors is that they are unsure how they can actually realize their profits. However, we should make the point that selling cryptocurrency back to US dollars is very simple.

That is – if you use a regulated broker like eToro – you can cash out your digital currency investment within seconds.

This is because the cryptocurrency tokens are stored by eToro and thus – you can access them around the clock by simply logging into your account.

Then, when you are ready to sell – you can do this from within your eToro portfolio.

The funds will instantly be reflected in your account balance – which you then have the option of withdrawing back to your bank account or debit/credit card.

Ways to Invest in Cryptocurrency

The easiest way to invest in cryptocurrency in the US is to use a secure online broker that supports your preferred deposit method. However, this isn’t the only way to gain exposure to this marketplace. As such, it’s important that you consider all options before you proceed to invest in digital currencies.

Cryptocurrency ATM

As the name implies, cryptocurrency ATMs allow you to invest in digital assets at a physical terminal. Most ATMs scattered around the US – of which there are thousands, will only support Bitcoin, Some might support other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Litecoin – but this will vary from provider to provider.

The main process of investing in cryptocurrency via an ATM is as follows:

Find your nearest cryptocurrency ATM by using a website like CoinAtmRadar

Once you have located your nearest ATM, select the cryptocurrency you want to buy

You will then be asked how much you wish to invest – which usually needs to be in multiples of $10

The ATM will then let you know how much cryptocurrency you will get for your stated investment

If you are happy with the exchange rate provided – you will then need to insert the dollar amount into the ATM

The ATM will then transfer your purchased cryptocurrency to your stated wallet address

Take note, although the process of investing in digital assets via cryptocurrency ATM might be simple, you do need to have access to a private wallet. Furthermore, and perhaps most pertinent, cryptocurrency ATMs average a commission of 10-15% per transaction.

Cryptocurrency Broker

Cryptocurrency brokers are regulated entities that have the legal remit to serve US clients. All of the brokers that we reviewed on this page fall within the category. This means that you can safely invest in cryptocurrencies in the US with a solid provider. The best cryptocurrency brokers operating in this space will support convenient payment types and offer competitive fees.

For example, at eToro, you can pay for your cryptocurrency investment with a debit/credit card – which will be processed instantly. You will also benefit from a super-low fee structure that starts at just 0.75% via the spread!

Cryptocurrency Exchanges

Cryptocurrency exchanges are plentiful – with hundreds currently operating in the online space. These exchanges sit between buyers and sellers – meaning that you will be trading with other market participants. The overarching selling point with cryptocurrency exchanges is that regulation is either lax or non-existent. This allows people to open accounts and deposit funds without needing to provide any personal information.

However, what you should know is that by using an unregulated cryptocurrency exchange that is based offshore – your funds are at risk. Not only in terms of an external hacking attempt but internal malpractice. If anything does go wrong at your chosen cryptocurrency exchange -= you will likely have nowhere to turn. All in all, the safest and most convenient option when investing in cryptocurrencies is to use a licensed online broker.

Should I Invest in Cryptocurrency?

If you’ve read our guide up to this point – then you are likely ready to invest in cryptocurrency for the first time. However, it is important to remember that while digital currencies have generated some extra-ordinarily financial returns in recent months and years, this asset class is still super volatile. That is to say, much of the industry is driven by market speculation and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).

To ensure that cryptocurrencies are right for your investment portfolio – be sure to make the following considerations before proceeding.

Huge Upside Potential

Make no mistake about it – there is every chance that you are looking to invest in cryptocurrency in the US because you have taken notice of the types of financial returns available. For example, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have generated astronomical growth levels since they launched in 2009 and 2015 respective.

This is also the case with other large-cap digital currencies like Litecoin, XRP, EOS, Cardano, and as of 2021 – Dogecoin. However, you then have up-and-coming cryptocurrencies that are several months, weeks, or even days old.

These digital assets provide the opportunity to target sizable financial returns – as oftentimes, these cryptocurrencies will enter the market will super-low valuation. This provides an upside that would otherwise not be seen in the traditional investment arena. To pick just one example of many, a digital currency called Safemoon was launched as recently as March 2021.

Fast forward just two months and the same crypto asset hit a market capitalization of just over $6 billion. But, of course, there is no guarantee that your chosen cryptocurrency will replicate similar returns. On ther contrary, you could lose some or even all of your investment stake.

Diversification is Simple

We briefly mentioned earlier that there are now over 11,000 digital currencies in this marketplace – with more and more additional being recorded on a week-to-week basis.

While most of these tokens won’t be worth your time – this does at the very least give you a great opportunity to create a diversified portfolio.

For example, you might elect to invest in Bitcoin alongside some smart contract projects like Ethereum, NEO, and Cardano.

You might also decide to add some smaller ERC-20 tokens to your portfolio and even a selection of up-and-coming DeFi coins.

The more you diversify in this industry – the less chance you have of being over-exposed to a specific cryptocurrency that no longer becomes relevant.

Entering the Market is Easy

Although you might not understand the intricacies of blockchain assets – never before has it been so easy to invest in cryptocurrencies in the US. In fact, all you need to do is open an account with one of the brokers discussed on this page – and you should be able to complete your cryptocurrency purchase in a matter of minutes.

When opting for a beginner-friendly platform like eToro – which is now used by over 20 million people, you only need to invest $25 into your chosen cryptocurrency. The platform also supports debit and credit card purchases – so you can invest from the comfort of your home with ease.

Cryptocurrency is Becoming Mainstream

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are no longer a developer’s pipedream. On the contrary, this innovative space has since become mainstream in more ways than one.

For example, regulators in virtually every nation-state have taken notice – with many even installing cryptocurrency-specific legislation as a way of governing the industry.

In the US specifically, there is now a regulated Bitcoin futures market and in the very near future – it is believed that an ETF will follow.

The cryptocurrency industry has also been embarrassed by a significant number of people and institutions – with the like of Tesla recently investing over $1.5 billion into Bitcoin.

Store of Value and Medium of Exchange

Nobody truly knows what role cryptocurrencies will play in the future of civilization. But, what we do know is that digital assets like Bitcoin carry many of the characteristics to function as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Regarding the former, Bitcoin has a finite value of just 21 million tokens – and so the supply of the digital currency cannot be manipulated by any person or authority.

The crypto asset is also easy to store, transfer, and fractionize – which again, makes it ideal as a store of value. Cryptocurrencies can also operate as a medium of exchange – especially when you consider the speed and cost-effectiveness at which transactions can be processed. For example, the likes of XRP and Stellar can facilitate cross-border transactions in a matter of seconds at a fee of just a fraction of a cent.

What are the Risks of Investing in Cryptocurrency?

It goes without saying that many cryptocurrency investors managing to time the market correctly have made vast financial gains from this industry. Bitcoin, for example, was priced at less than $0.01 when it was first launched in 2009. The de-facto cryptocurrency has since hit highs of over $64,000.

But, cryptocurrencies do present a much higher risk/reward spectrum than traditional assets – so you do need to consider this before parting with any of your hard-earned money.

The most inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments in the US are as follows:

Speculation and FOMO

The first thing to remember is that arguably – the vast bulk of people entering the cryptocurrency investment scene for the first time are market speculators driven by FOMO. That is to say, people invest because they think that by not doing so – they are missing out on huge profits. However, this speculative approach to cryptocurrency means that people are entering the market for all the wrong reasons.

For example, if you were to buy shares in Tesla – you would have a good reason to do so. This is because the company solves real-world problems through its innovative electric vehicles and renewable technologies. However, by investing in a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin – which was created as a joke, you are likely doing so for speculative reasons.

High Volatility Levels

Cryptocurrencies are more volatile than move asset classes in the investment space. That is to say, the value of your cryptocurrency investment can skyrocket – but, it can also capitulate in lighting speed.

Let’s take Let’s once again take the example of Safemoon – which we mentioned earlier.

To recap, this digital currency went from 0 to a market capitalization of $6 billion in a matter of two months.

This is great for those that invested when the cryptocurrency was first launched.

However, at the time of writing in September 2021, Safemoon is now carrying a market capitalization of $1.38 billion.

Although this is still impressive, this does mean that those that invested at its peak in May 2021 and now looking at losses in excess of 77%.

This reinforces our point that irrespective of the cryptocurrency you decided to invest in – you must be prepared for high levels of volatility.

How Much Does it Cost to Invest in Cryptocurrency?

The costs involved when investing in cryptocurrency in the US will vary depending on:

Your chosen broker

Your preferred payment method

The size of your investment

Let’s break down the main costs involved in digital asset investing so that you know what to look out for when choosing a cryptocurrency broker.

Deposits and Withdrawals

If you are happy to deposit funds via ACH or a bank wire – you might be able to benefit from free transactions. But, if you prefer the speed and convenience of using a debit or credit card, the fees can be costly. For example, Coinmama charges 5% on debit/credit card purchases while at Coinbase – it’s 3.99%.

On the other hand, when reviewing top-rated cryptocurrency broker eToro, we found that the provider allows you to fund your account on a fee-free basis. This is the case for both bank account deposits and debit/credit cards.

Commissions and Spreads

Trading commissions are charged by brokers when you buy and sell cryptocurrencies. This works in the same way as buying and selling shares from a traditional stockbroker.

For example:

Let’s say that you use Coinbase to invest in cryptocurrency – which charges a standard commission of 1.49%.

If you decide to invest $5,000 – then your commission will amount to $74.50

We’ll then say that you sell your cryptocurrency investment when it has increased in value to $10,000

This means that at 1.49% – your sell commission at Coinbase would amount to $149

In total, you paid $223.50 in commission to enter and exit the market

Now let’ see what this would have cost you when using a spread-only broker like eToro:

eToro charges a spread of 0.75% when you invest in Bitcoin

So, your $5,000 investment would attract an indirect fee of $37.50

You sell your Bitcoin investment when it is worth $10,000 – so the spread here amounts to $75

All in all, your trading fees – via the spread, amounted to $112.50

Comparing the two brokers means that you saved $111 by using eToro instead of Coinbase. However, the savings here are likely to be even larger when you factor in the spread at Coinbase – which is believed to average 0.50%.

How to Buy Invest in Cryptocurrency – Conclusion

This beginner’s guide has provided you with each and every piece of information that you need to invest in cryptocurrency in the US. We’ve explained the fundamentals of why choosing a broker is so important – and that in order to do this, you will need to focus on metrics surrounding regulation, fees, payment types, and supported markets.

If you are ready to invest in cryptocurrency in the US right now – you might want to consider eToro for this purpose. In doing so, you will be using a US-approved broker that allows you to invest in dozens of different digital assets at industry-leading fees. You simply need to open an account, deposit funds via a bank wire or debit/credit card – and choose the cryptocurrency that you want to invest in. It really is that simple!

Law Project Establishes Period to Decide Cryptocurrency Regulations in Brazil – Regulation Bitcoin News - Bitcoin News,"Law Project Establishes Period to Decide Cryptocurrency Regulations in Brazil

A law project introduced in June in the National Congress of Brazil has jumped into the spotlight recently because it establishes a fixed period for the executive to start regulating cryptocurrency transactions. If approved, the proposal will establish the payment of taxes for cryptocurrency-based transactions. The project is being reviewed by the Chamber of Deputies and will have to be analyzed conclusively by the Finance and Taxation Committee.

Cryptocurrency Transactions to Be Regulated in Brazil

A law project proposal, Bill 2140/21, that was introduced to the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil in June, is now in the spotlight because it establishes a fixed period for the regulation of cryptocurrency transactions for the executive branch of the government. If approved, it would give a time limit of 180 days to devise all the necessary structures to regulate cryptocurrency transactions in an effective way. The project was presented by the deputy Alexandre Frota, part of the Partido de la Social Democracia Brasileña (PSDB).

Frota states that the absence of clear regulation for cryptocurrencies puts investors and the traditional financial system at risk, as crypto can aid in getting funds out of the country with no supervision. Frota declared:

With private and public banks, it is necessary to have rigorous regulation and inspection so that the population will not be deceived with promises of high individual profits, which has already happened to a great extent.

Brazil has been a country known for its crime associated with crypto-related scams in the last few years. The state has been fast to act when it comes to stopping these schemes, organizing several operations to shut down and arrest those responsible for illegal cryptocurrency-related activity over the last few months.

Taxes Could Be Coming

Another important part of the project states that operations carried out abroad must be scrutinized according to the same rules applied to banks, including taxation norms. However, it is still unclear how this might be carried out, due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions. This issue is currently being tackled by a special committee of the Chamber of Deputies.

However, Brazil is very much open to the issuance of a central bank digital currency. The Central Bank of Brazil is researching the creation of a Digital Real and debating if there is really a demand for such an instrument from the Brazilian population.

How Ethereum's Next Big Upgrade Could Boost Its Value - The Motley Fool,"Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH)- the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, and the most popular smart contract and decentralized application network -- just changed the way it pays the people who maintain its network, in ways that could make it an even more appealing investment. When the next major evolution in its upgrade roadmap occurs, this change could reduce its supply and increase its value. That might be great news for investors seeking to hedge against inflation.

How Ethereum's changing its network

Since Aug. 5, a portion of the fees paid by users of Ethereum's network, which used to go toward making new coins with which to pay miners, has instead been burnt or destroyed. A total of 177,424 ETH, worth around $672 million at the time of writing, has been taken out of circulation since the upgrade, leaving 117.3 million tokens in circulation according to CoinMarketCap. By taking coins out of circulation, this change could make each existing coin more valuable.

Ethereum is currently produced by miners under a proof-of-work consensus mechanism that consumes a lot of energy, just like Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) production. It has a variable annual inflation rate of around 2.8% at the moment -- but it'll issue fewer new coins when it upgrades its network to a staking-based consensus.

Instead of solving tough math problems to keep the network running smoothly -- and getting rewarded for it -- Ethereum holders will be able to do the same things by storing away, or staking, some or all of their tokens. Around 6.2% of the circulating supply, or 7.4 million ETH tokens worth an estimated $28 billion, have already been staked. That staked ETH is currently earning an annual percentage yield of 5.8%, way more than any bank.

Once Ethereum's major upgrade occurs sometime in late 2021 or early 2022, one simulation estimates that the circulating supply of Ethereum could shrink by around 1.4% each year at current rates of fee burning. In theory, that might reduce the value of each token by an equal proportion. This means that the circulating supply of the asset will shrink.

Ethereum has way more use cases

Bitcoin is currently viewed as a store of value, or a safe haven asset to hedge against inflationary fiat currencies. But Ethereum is more of an economy -- a fledgling financial landscape for the internet.

Aside from staking, Ethereum is also the foundation for decentralized finance protocols, many of which are based on Ethereum and its smart contracts. These smart contracts, which run on the blockchain and execute when predetermined conditions are met, are also used to build decentralized applications (dApps).

Investors currently have 7.7 million ETH, or $29 billion, locked up in DeFi protocols for token swapping, yield farming, or liquidity mining. This is where token holders can provide collateral in crypto assets to earn more crypto assets.

Ethereum is also the standard for the majority of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, which have been booming in sales this year. NFTs are unique tokens on the blockchain that prove ownership; they can represent art, music, gaming items, avatars, and even real estate.

Additionally, Ethereum is the base layer for stablecoins -- digital assets pegged to a fiat currency. Around half of the world's most popular stablecoin, Tether (CRYPTO:USDT), is based on the Ethereum standard, with $34 billion worth residing on the network.

There's just one drawback to Ethereum's current popularity: Rising demand has inflated network fees, with the average transaction now costing $40. The currency's upcoming upgrade includes other improvements designed to lower those fees and speed up transactions, but for now, the higher fees make it harder for people and other apps to actually use Ethereum.

Why big banks are buying in

Ethereum's strengths compared to Bitcoin have driven Ethereum prices 400% higher since the beginning of 2021, compared to just 70% for Bitcoin.

Major institutions such as Grayscale have taken notice, and they're loading up on ETH. Institutional funds offer wealthy clients exposure to the asset without requiring them to hold it, and Grayscale currently holds $10 billion worth of ETH in its Ethereum Trust (OTC:ETHE).

Even some of the big Wall Street banks have leaned bullish on Ethereum. In July, analysts at investment bank Goldman Sachs said that Ethereum's real use cases give it the potential to become the dominant digital store of value in the coming years.

The network may also be viewed as a more environmentally friendly investment when it moves away from mining, which looks good to eco-conscious corporations.

Coupled with the prospect of supply deflation, these factors could drive an uptick in demand and prices. That trend might only grow stronger if the COVID-19 pandemic spurs inflation and currency devaluations on a global scale.

Increased regulation in the U.S., such as the controversial crypto tax reporting bill, could stifle innovation and mainstream Ethereum adoption in the short term. There is also the threat of faster rival blockchains such as Cardano or Polkadot becoming the de facto standard for smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps.

These networks have gained traction recently as the crypto ecosystem expands, but Ethereum has already cemented itself as the industry standard, just as IBM did with computing in the early 1980s. With so many platforms already running on Ethereum, and it having the largest support and developer community, it will be no mean feat to knock the network off its perch.

With this in mind, now might not be a bad time to buy and hold Ethereum for at least couple of years.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/04/how-ethereums-next-big-upgrade-could-boost-its-val/,2021-09-04,The Motley Fool,https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/641991/woman-using-ethereum.jpg,none
"Ethereum, The Second-Largest Cryptocurrency, Has Split into Two Versions - Analytics Insight","Ethereum, The Second-Largest Cryptocurrency, Has Split into Two Versions

In the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum has now split into two chains. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency as per the market cap, Ethereum’s split happened as its old Ethereum network’s nodes have failed to upgrade to the ‘Hades Gamma’ patch. The patch was released on 24th August and a bug was detected in the 1.10.7 version of the Ethereum network.

Its old network, Go Ethereum informed its users on Twitter on August 27 about the split and information about the 1.10.8 version in terms of security. The team asked users to upgrade their nodes having Hades Gamma patch to the new version if they already haven’t done so. Geth is a command-line interface that runs Ethereum nodes implemented in the Go language. Geth enables the users to join the Ethereum network, make transactions between accounts, and mine Ether.

All the information about the blockchain is stored on the network in the form of transactions chains. As each chain gets verified, every transaction is then added to the digital ledger. Now that there is a split in the chain, all the transactions will not be verified by all the nodes. Hence, the split is an understandable cause of concern for Ethereum investors and Ethereum-based applications. It increases the occurrence of double-spending, which refers to a single transaction being registered more than once, allowing users to misinterpret the amount in the wallet. Until this issue is fixed, experts are advising users to not make any transactions.",https://www.analyticsinsight.net/ethereum-the-second-largest-cryptocurrency-has-split-into-two-versions/,2021-09-04,Analytics Insight,https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ethereum-The-Second-Largest-Cryptocurrency-Has-Split-into-Two-Versions.jpg,none
Crypto’s rapid move into banking elicits alarm in Washington - Economic Times,"BlockFi, a fast-growing financial startup whose headquarters in Jersey City, New Jersey, are across the Hudson River from Wall Street, aspires to be the JPMorgan Chase of cryptocurrency.It offers credit cards, loans and interest-generating accounts. But rather than dealing primarily in dollars, BlockFi operates in the rapidly expanding world of digital currencies, one of a new generation of institutions effectively creating an alternative banking system on the frontiers of technology.“We are just at the beginning of this story,” said Flori Marquez, 30, a founder of BlockFi, which was created in 2017 and claims to have more than $10 billion in assets, 850 employees and more than 450,000 retail clients who can obtain loans in minutes, without credit checks.But to state and federal regulators and some members of Congress, the entry of crypto into banking is cause for alarm. The technology is disrupting the world of financial services so quickly and unpredictably that regulators are far behind, potentially leaving consumers and financial markets vulnerable.In recent months, top officials from the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators have urgently begun what they are calling a “crypto sprint” to try to catch up with the rapid changes and figure out how to curb the potential dangers from an emerging industry whose short history has been marked as much by high-stakes speculation as by technological advances.In interviews and public statements, federal officials and state authorities are warning that the crypto financial services industry is in some cases vulnerable to hackers and fraud and reliant on risky innovations. In August, the crypto platform PolyNetwork briefly lost $600 million of its customers’ assets to hackers, much of which was returned only after the site’s founders begged the thieves to relent.“We need additional authorities to prevent transactions, products and platforms from falling between regulatory cracks,” Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote in August in a letter to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., about the dangers of cryptocurrency products. “We also need more resources to protect investors in this growing and volatile sector.”The SEC has created a stand-alone office to coordinate investigations into cryptocurrency and other digital assets, and it has recruited academics with related expertise to help it track the fast-moving changes. Acknowledging that it could take at least a year to write rules or get legislation passed in Congress, regulators may issue interim guidance to set some expectations to exert control over the industry.BlockFi has already been targeted by regulators in five states that have accused it of violating local securities laws.Regulators’ worries reach to even more experimental offerings by outfits such as PancakeSwap, whose “syrup pools” boast that users can earn up to 91% annual return on crypto deposits.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Fed Chair Jerome Powell have also voiced concerns, even as the Fed and other central banks study whether to issue digital currencies of their own.Powell has pointed to the proliferation of so-called stablecoins, digital currencies whose value is typically pegged to the dollar and are frequently used in digital money transfers and other transactions like lending.“We have a tradition in this country where, you know, where the public’s money is held in what is supposed to be a very safe asset,” Powell said during congressional testimony in July. “That doesn’t exist really for stablecoins.”The cryptocurrency banking frontier features a wide range of companies. At one end are those that operate on models similar to those of traditional consumer-oriented banks, such as BlockFi or Kraken Bank, which has secured a special charter in Wyoming and hopes by the end of this year to take consumers’ cryptocurrency deposits — but without traditional Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. insurance.On the more radical end is decentralized finance, which is more akin to Wall Street for cryptocurrency. Players include Compound, a company in San Francisco that operates completely outside the regulatory system. Decentralized finance eliminates human intermediaries such as brokers, bank clerks and traders, and instead uses algorithms to execute financial transactions, such as lending and borrowing.“Crypto is the new shadow bank,” Warren said in an interview. “It provides many of the same services, but without the consumer protections or financial stability that back up the traditional system.“It’s like spinning straw into gold,” she added.Lawmakers and regulators are worried that consumers are not always fully aware of the potential dangers of the new banklike crypto services and decentralized finance platforms. Crypto deposit accounts are not federally insured, and holdings may not be guaranteed if markets go haywire.People who borrow against their crypto could face liquidation of their holdings, sometimes in entirely automated markets that are unregulated.BlockFi’s extraordinary growth — and the recent crackdown by state regulators — illustrates the fraught path of cryptocurrency financial services companies amid confusion about what they do.BlockFi’s business is not dissimilar to that of a regular bank. It takes deposits of cryptocurrencies and pays interest on them. It makes loans in dollars to people who put up cryptocurrency as collateral. And it lends crypto to institutions that need it.For consumers, the main allure of BlockFi is the chance to take loans in dollars up to half of the value of their crypto collateral, allowing customers to get cash without the tax hit of selling their digital assets, or to leverage the value of holdings to buy more cryptocurrency. The company also offers interest of up to 8% per year on crypto deposits, compared with a national average of 0.06% for savings deposits at banks in August.How can BlockFi offer such a high rate? In addition to charging interest on the loans it makes to consumers, it lends cryptocurrency to institutions such as Fidelity Investments or Susquehanna International Group that use those assets for quick and sometimes lucrative cryptocurrency arbitrage transactions, passing on high returns to customers. And because BlockFi is not officially a bank, it does not have the large costs associated with maintaining required capital reserves and following other banking regulations.Also unlike a bank, BlockFi does not check credit scores, relying instead on the value of customers’ underlying crypto collateral. Company executives argue that the approach democratizes financial services, opening them to people without the traditional hallmarks of reliability — such as good credit — but with digital assets.The model has worked for BlockFi. It is hiring employees from London to Singapore, while prominent investors — including Bain Capital, Winklevoss Capital and Coinbase Ventures — have jumped in to fund its expansion. The company has raised at least $450 million in capital.But to regulators, BlockFi’s offerings are worrying and perplexing — so much so that in California, where BlockFi first sought a lender’s license, officials initially advised it to instead apply for a pawnbroker license. Their reasoning was that customers seeking a loan from BlockFi hand over cryptocurrency holdings as collateral in the same way that a customer might give a pawnshop a watch in exchange for cash.BlockFi's Marquez called the Sheriff’s Office in San Francisco about a pawnbroker license, only to be redirected again. “No, pawnbrokers’ licenses are only for physical goods,” she recounted being told. “And because crypto is a virtual asset, this license actually does not apply to you.”Undeterred, she returned to the state’s banking regulators and convinced them that BlockFi qualified as a lender, albeit of a new variety. The company now has licenses in at least 28 states, which it uses for cryptocurrency deposits from its more than 450,000 clients — many of whom are outside the United States. In the first three months of this year, the value of crypto held in BlockFi interest-bearing accounts more than tripled to $14.7 billion from $4.4 billion, a jump driven in part by the rise in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.As the company has expanded, regulators have become increasingly concerned. New Jersey’s attorney general sent it a cease-and-desist letter in July, saying it sells a financial product that requires a securities license, with all the associated obligations, including mandated disclosures.“No one gets a free pass simply because they’re operating in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency market,” acting Attorney General Andrew Bruck said.BlockFi does not adequately notify customers of risks associated with its use of their cryptocurrency deposits for borrowing pools, including the “creditworthiness of borrowers, the type and nature of transactions,” officials in Texas added in their own complaint, echoing allegations made by state officials in Alabama, Kentucky and Vermont.BlockFi CEO Zac Prince said that the company was complying with the law but that regulators did not fully understand its offerings. “Ultimately, we see this as an opportunity for BlockFi to help define the regulatory environment for our ecosystem,” he wrote in a note to customers.The regulatory challenge is even greater when it comes to other emerging crypto finance developers in the world of decentralized finance, such as Compound, SushiSwap and Aave as well as PancakeSwap.They are all essentially automated markets run by computer programs facilitating transactions without human intervention — the crypto-era version of trading floors. The idea is to eliminate intermediaries and bring together buyers and sellers on the blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency. The sites do not even collect users’ personal information.Founders of those kinds of platforms argue that they are just building a “protocol” ultimately led by a community of users, with the computer code effectively running the show.Robert Leshner, 37, started Compound in 2018 after spending a year in a tiny attic office sublet in the Mission district in San Francisco with five colleagues, experimenting with a computer program that would become part of the foundation of the decentralized-finance movement.Compound — backed by prominent crypto venture capitalists such as Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase Ventures — now has more than $20 billion in assets. Each of the nearly 300,000 “customers” is represented by a unique 42-character list of letters and numbers. But Compound does not know their names or even what country they are from.Leshner and others who helped set up Compound own a large share of its self-issued cryptocurrency token — known as COMP — which has surged in value, making him worth, at least on paper, tens of millions of dollars.Leshner has been startled by the rapid growth. “At every juncture, the speed at which decentralized finance has just, like, started to work has caught myself and everybody off guard,” he said.Industry executives say concerns about the safety and stability of digital assets are overblown, but federal financial regulators are still working to get a handle on the latest developments.Decentralized-finance protocols largely rely upon stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are ostensibly pegged to the U.S. dollar for a steady value but without guarantees that their value is adequately backed.The overall market of stablecoins has ballooned to $117 billion as of early September from $3.3 billion in January 2019. That has regulators worried.“These things are effectively treated by users as bank deposits,” said Lee Reiners, a former supervisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “But unlike actual deposits, they are not insured by FDIC, and if account holders begin to have concerns that they cannot get money out, they might try and trigger a bank run.”An option worth considering, Warren said, is to ban banks in the United States from holding cash deposits backing up stablecoins, which could effectively end the surging market. Another possibility that some say could undermine the entire crypto ecosystem is the creation of a government-issued digital dollar.“You wouldn’t need stablecoins, you wouldn’t need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital U.S. currency,” Powell, the Fed chair, said in July. “I think that’s one of the stronger arguments in its favor.”",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/cryptos-rapid-move-into-banking-elicits-alarm-in-washington/articleshow/85941723.cms,2021-09-05,Economic Times,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85941708,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-33310,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",none
European Citizens Reject EU-Imposed Crypto Regulation – Bitcoin News - Bitcoin News,"European Citizens Reject EU-Imposed Crypto Regulation

Most European citizens reject the idea of a cryptocurrency regulation regime imposed by the European Union (EU) on its member states, according to a recent survey. Most surveyed citizens lean towards independent cryptocurrency regulation in each country, compared to 25% that approve an EU-imposed regulation. However, most of the citizens polled acknowledged they still don’t know much about cryptocurrencies in the first place.

Europeans Reject EU Crypto Laws, Favor Local Proposals

European citizens are against the establishment of EU-imposed cryptocurrency-related laws, according to a recent survey ordered by Euronews. The poll, that was carried out by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, a global consulting firm, polled more than 31,000 citizens in 12 states of the European block: Germany, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Spain.

The survey found that most Europeans support locally issued laws instead of a set of rules imposed by the European Union. Citizens from Greece (51%), Italy (47%), Estonia (46%), Netherlands (41%), Germany (40%), Latvia (39%), and France (37%) said they would prefer their own government to regulate cryptocurrencies.

Also, a surprisingly high number of citizens would prefer the issuance of local cryptocurrencies instead of a digital euro, something that shows more and more Europeans blame economic inefficiencies on the European Union integration. Dimitar Lilkov, from the Wilfried Martens Center for European Studies in Brussels, stated:

A large part of the population remains convinced that the crisis was caused by poor decisions made at the EU level and not by serious deficiencies in its national banking sector.

However, the affiliation of each country with the EU impedes this from being a reality. Italians (41%), Greeks (40%), Estonians (39%), and Spaniards (37%) registered the highest support for the initiative. On this, Likov stated:

Eurozone countries that want to make use of a digital currency would be linked to a potential digital euro, led by the ECB in coordination with the eurozone banking system.

To him, any country issuing its own central bank digital currency would have to exit the EU in order to do so due to the possibility of a digital euro happening in the future.

Cryptocurrency Still Unknown

The survey also revealed that most European citizens have only just heard “a little” about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This shows that, even with the recent boom of crypto assets due to a bull season, there is still room for people to get better informed about cryptocurrencies and their proposals. In fact, the lack of knowledge about cryptocurrencies appears again in the survey as the main reason why Europeans have avoided purchasing crypto assets.

"Cryptocurrency scam victim suffered 'over $100000' in losses, Delta police say - CTV News Vancouver","VANCOUVER -- Police in Delta are warning residents thinking about investing in cryptocurrency to do their due diligence, after receiving six complaints about scams in recent weeks.

Most of the complaints were made in August, according to a news release from the Delta Police Department.

""Unfortunately their losses have been significant, ranging from just under $5,000 to over $100,000 in one file,"" police said in their release.

Police said there are ""a number of common factors"" in the six files that have been reported to them.

In most of the cases, the scammers contacted the victims through online platforms - such as dating sites and chat apps - and established a relationship with them.

""Investors were typically encouraged to e-transfer funds from their bank accounts to mobile wallets, and from there to unknown accounts,"" Delta police said. ""When victims tried to withdraw their 'profits' or investment, the money was either gone, or the victim was informed they needed to pay considerable additional fees to access their money.""

Police said would-be investors should research the name of the investment company or website they're considering to see if anyone else has been scammed. Investors should also avoid taking advice from people online who they've never met, police said.

For reputable information for investors, Delta police recommend visiting the websites of the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Canadian Securities Administrators.",https://bc.ctvnews.ca/cryptocurrency-scam-victim-suffered-over-100-000-in-losses-delta-police-say-1.5574115,2021-09-05,CTV News Vancouver,https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1717992.1394149852!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,none
Law Project Establishes Period To Decide Cryptocurrency Regulations In Brazil – Regulation Bitcoin News - - Todayuknews,"A law project introduced in June in the National Congress of Brazil has jumped into the spotlight recently because it establishes a fixed period for the executive to start regulating cryptocurrency transactions. If approved, the proposal will establish the payment of taxes for cryptocurrency-based transactions. The project is being reviewed by the Chamber of Deputies and will have to be analyzed conclusively by the Finance and Taxation Committee.

Cryptocurrency Transactions to Be Regulated in Brazil

A law project proposal, Bill 2140/21, that was introduced to the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil in June, is now in the spotlight because it establishes a fixed period for the regulation of cryptocurrency transactions for the executive branch of the government. If approved, it would give a time limit of 180 days to devise all the necessary structures to regulate cryptocurrency transactions in an effective way. The project was presented by the deputy Alexandre Frota, part of the Partido de la Social Democracia Brasileña (PSDB).

Frota states that the absence of clear regulation for cryptocurrencies puts investors and the traditional financial system at risk, as crypto can aid in getting funds out of the country with no supervision. Frota declared:

With private and public banks, it is necessary to have rigorous regulation and inspection so that the population will not be deceived with promises of high individual profits, which has already happened to a great extent.

Brazil has been a country known for its crime associated with crypto-related scams in the last few years. The state has been fast to act when it comes to stopping these schemes, organizing several operations to shut down and arrest those responsible for illegal cryptocurrency-related activity over the last few months.





Taxes Could Be Coming

Another important part of the project states that operations carried out abroad must be scrutinized according to the same rules applied to banks, including taxation norms. However, it is still unclear how this might be carried out, due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions. This issue is currently being tackled by a special committee of the Chamber of Deputies.

However, Brazil is very much open to the issuance of a central bank digital currency. The Central Bank of Brazil is researching the creation of a Digital Real and debating if there is really a demand for such an instrument from the Brazilian population.

Uniswap (UNI) Falls on Reports of SEC Probe - The Motley Fool,"Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Uniswap (UNI) fell 5% today on reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would investigate Uniswap Labs. According to The Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the case, SEC lawyers will probe how investors use Uniswap and how it is marketed.

A decentralized exchange (DEX) facilitates trading without the need for third parties -- like a broker -- in the middle. Uniswap is one of the major DEXs and is unusual in that it is based in the U.S.

DEXs tend to be more anonymous than centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini. These require users to provide personal information to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. In contrast, Uniswap customers only need to connect their wallets to be able to trade.

DEXs also have a wider selection of available coins than centralized exchanges. Uniswap, for example, supports thousands of Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens.

What does this mean for Uniswap?

It is early days, and an investigation doesn't necessarily mean the SEC will bring any formal charges. However, given SEC Chair Gary Gensler's previous comments about the need to clamp down on exchanges selling unregulated securities, this investigation could be just the start.

Gensler, who took up the position of SEC chair in April, spoke substantively about crypto for the first time at the start of August. He told the Aspen Security Forum that it was likely many cryptocurrencies were actually unregistered securities. ""I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities, without required disclosures or market oversight,"" he said.

Securities have to follow strict rules about how they are traded and how they report information. Most cryptocurrencies, however, are treated as commodities and are not subject to the same level of scrutiny.

Gensler believes the legislative priority should center on crypto trading, lending, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Ordinary cryptocurrency exchanges are not allowed to trade securities. ""Make no mistake,"" Gensler said. ""To the extent that there are securities on these trading platforms, under our laws they have to register with the Commission unless they meet an exemption.""

The shifting sands of regulation

Discussions continue in Washington about what direction cryptocurrency regulation should take, and how heavy it should be. Authorities are trying to weigh questions of consumer protection against questions of personal freedom. There's also a concern that overregulation could damage this emerging industry.

In the meantime, Gensler seems to want to use existing rules to crack down on a market that he views as the ""Wild West.""

The SEC is in the middle of a protracted legal battle with Ripple (XRP) because it claims Ripple has been operating as an unregistered security. Ripple execs argue that it is a cryptocurrency and that the SEC should have informed them of the issue much earlier.

It's worth noting that so far, SEC actions haven't had that much impact on crypto prices. Sure, Ripple is no longer among the top three cryptos by market capitalization. But it continues to rank amongst the top 10, even though it isn't easy for U.S. traders to buy it.

The worry for Uniswap and other exchanges is that the SEC may try to pursue trading platforms rather than individual cryptocurrencies. And by Gensler's logic, with thousands of coins on the Uniswap platform, there's a good chance one of them is a security.",https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/uniswap-uni-falls-on-reports-of-sec-probe/,2021-09-04,The Motley Fool,https://m.foolcdn.com/media/affiliates/images/Group_of_young_people_in_library.2e16d0ba.fill-1080x1080_Fw8gSJX.jpg,none
"Twitter May Soon Let Users Add Bitcoin, Ethereum Addresses to Their Profiles for Tips - Gadgets 360","Twitter is found to be working on allowing users to add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their profiles to receive tips in cryptocurrencies. The new addition could be aimed to upgrade the Tip Jar feature that the microblogging network introduced earlier this year. Twitter is working on the ability to let users receive tips in Bitcoin through the Tip Jar feature. CEO Jack Dorsey in July suggested the implementation by calling Bitcoin a “big part” of the company's future in conversation with analysts and investors.

Mobile app developer Alessandro Paluzzi has found references about Twitter bringing the ability to let users add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their profiles. The developer posted a tweet that carried three screenshots to indicate the new options.

The first screenshot suggests that users would be able to copy Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to send tips in any of the two cryptocurrencies using the Tip Jar feature. In the second and third ones, Twitter appears to allow users to add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their profiles.

#Twitter is working to allow you to add your #Bitcoin and #Ethereum address to your profile to receive tips via the Tip Jar feature 👀



ℹ️ It is not necessary to link a Strike account to add them to your profile. pic.twitter.com/xT9Tg1vdzR — Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) September 2, 2021

Alongside the screenshots suggesting the addition of Bitcoin and Ethereum address options, Paluzzi on Wednesday tweeted a screenshot to suggest the arrival of Bitcoin support to the Tip Jar feature. That tweet received a comment from Twitter's product lead Kayvon Beykpour that includes a lightning bolt emoji along with another saying “soon” to confirm its development and its imminent release.

Beykpour did not provide any further details about when exactly the ability to receive tips in Bitcoin through Tip Jar will be available to users. However, the screenshot posted by Paluzzi does suggest that Twitter would consider payment transfer technology The Lightning Network to allow tipping in Bitcoin on its platform.

The screenshot also suggested that Twitter would use Strike to generate Bitcoin Lightning invoices for the cryptocurrency tips users will get through the platform. Paluzzi on his newer tweet, though, says that users will not be required to link a Strike account for adding their Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses.

A report by MacRumor says that the work for Bitcoin tips has been suggested through Twitter for iOS beta code. It isn't available to beta testers at this moment, though.

In May, Twitter introduced its Tip Jar feature to let creators, journalists, and nonprofits monetise their tweets in the form of tips. The company initially enabled users to share links to their Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, Paypal, and Venmo accounts for receiving tips from their followers. That was, however, just the beginning as the platform appears to be adding cryptocurrencies as the new payment options.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has advocated cryptocurrencies for some time. In August, he said that Bitcoin would “unite a deeply divided country.” Dorsey during Twitter's earnings call in July also called the “big part” of Twitter's future.

“I think there's a lot of innovation above just currency to be had, especially as we think about decentralising social media more and providing more economic incentive,” he said while answering a question on how he sees Bitcoin becoming an integral part of Twitter.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/twitter-cryptocurrency-donation-bitcoin-ethereum-addresses-tips-tip-jar-feature-update-2529649,2021-09-04,Gadgets 360,https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/twitter_logo_main_pixabay_1620814744949.jpg,none
Xiaomi has started accepting cryptocurrency payments in Portugal - InTallaght,"Xiaomi has sent us the following clarification to the published information. Today we learned that “Mi Store Portugal” has published information on the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a payment method on its channel on a social network. From Xiaomi Corporation we would like to clarify that both “Mi Store Portugal”, and its associated channels, are managed by a third party. Thus, although we respect and understand the legitimate operational autonomy of third-party stores, the decision to accept cryptocurrencies has no relationship with the company and has been made without the entity’s knowledge or approval. The company’s official distributor, Mi Store Portugal, has recently made the decision to accept payments in digital currencies known as Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to a BolNews report, the Chinese tech giant now allows Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and even Dash payments for the purchase of smartphones, smartwatches, along with other smart home products and devices. Xiaomi has partnered with Utrust, a Swiss cryptocurrency payment service provider, to enable payment via digital assets in the region. According to Pedro Maia, Marketing Manager at Mi Store Portugal: We are a technological, innovative and disruptive brand. That is why we always want to be one step ahead. We want to give all true technology fans the possibility to buy their favorite gadgets with what is currently the most technological money. Portugal is one of the most cryptocurrency-friendly European governments due to its tax laws.

"Investor confidence most important thing for crypto industry: Nischal Shetty, WazirX - Economic Times","We are in a financial sector and regulatory clarity brings in more investor confidence , which is the most important thing that this sector needs. So, we are all pushing for regulations in the sector as an industry, said, Founder & CEO,during ET Now's India Development Debate on the new crypto bill. Edited excerpts:Absolutely, I think that is a really positive step for the entire ecosystem. In fact, everyone is finally happy about this classification because before this it was all about putting crypto under one basic umbrella of currency and now there is finally talk about how to classify into various categories.So, asset or commodities is one of the many categories. There is also the obvious one: currency. But the majority of the use cases they fall under are utility. The fourth is a security. So, there are four major classifications of crypto and it is a welcome move for the entire industry. We are all excited; it is a great progress for the entire ecosystem.In terms of absolute numbers, I think on our exchange WazirX alone we have added more than 4 or 5 million people in – not even one year – under seven to eight months. That is a massive number of people entering the whole crypto ecosystem. As an industry we are now well over 15 to 17 million people in the whole ecosystem and that is just testament to the fact that everyone in India is looking forward to crypto as an asset class.Now your question about whether this is hampering growth. For sure, that is a yes. It is hampering growth, not just for one or two companies, but for the entire sector. Let us take for example investments in startups in the sector. India still ranks as one of the lower numbers compared to anywhere in the world like US and UK. In terms of even the number of start-ups that has grown large in India, it is considerably lower compared to the rest of the world.This is the regulatory uncertainty playing. Despite this, the growth and the number of people entering the ecosystem is really going well. But ultimately, we are in a financial sector and regulatory clarity brings in more investor confidence, which is the most important thing that this sector needs. So, we are all pushing for regulations in the sector as an industry.Not really. I think in fact that is a good point that you raised. I do not think crypto is trying to replace or compete with fiat currencies like the INR or the US dollar. What it is trying to do is fill the gaps on the internet which traditional currency does not really fulfil. There are lots of those opportunities that crypto is already existing. As simple as today, in the lack of regulation and no payment use case, the industry is still over $2 trillion in market cap and that itself just proves that crypto does not really need to come into the traditional payment mechanism.But it can fulfil payment use cases which traditional currencies do not. For example, cross-border payments that might be use case in remittance for India. That might be a use case that might emerge in the future. But again, as on today, the success of crypto currencies come in the use case where you need to pay for smart contracts on the block chains for example. There you cannot use traditional currency, so that is where majority of the use cases lie. That is where the progress is happening as on today. So, I do not really believe that the traditional payment use cases are something of a dampener. Cryptos cannot get into that.Look, the most important thing to understand out here is the largest age group – the demographic of people in crypto – is 23 to 30 years. This is the internet first population. If there is one thing they are really good at, it is extracting information online. I believe that most of them are well read and they understand. But apart from that, as an ecosystem what we are all doing is spreading the right information about crypto through education initiatives as an industry.We, in fact, also have an industry effort to self-regulate ourselves even in the absence of regulation. So, I think all of these are adding to an informed ecosystem. I do not really believe that we have a problem of misinformation. In fact, the misinformation tends to be more towards negative. There are people who think that India has banned crypto, which is not the case. So, there is no one who thinks that crypto is all regulated and it is all hunky-dory. People are coming with a view that it is still unregulated and the government has still not taken a hard position on that. So, let us invest cautiously. That is what a majority of people in the ecosystem have an outlook towards.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/investor-confidence-most-important-thing-for-crypto-industry-nischal-shetty-wazirx/articleshow/85923202.cms,2021-09-04,Economic Times,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85923291,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-105105,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",none

Vitalik Buterin Has Suggestions for Dogecoin and Doge's Cooperation With Ethereum – Altcoins Bitcoin News - Bitcoin News,"Vitalik Buterin Has Suggestions for Dogecoin and Doge's Cooperation With Ethereum

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has some suggestions of what he personally would like to see happening with Dogecoin and the meme cryptocurrency’s cooperation with Ethereum.

Vitalik Buterin on Dogecoin’s Development and Its Ethereum Collaboration

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared his thoughts on the potential cooperation between Dogecoin and Ethereum Wednesday as part of a Twitter experiment he is conducting where only the 268 people he followed can ask him questions.

Three Arrows Capital CEO Zhu Su asked: “What are some promising ideas for Ethereum / Doge cooperation? What was it about Doge that got you interested in the project?” Su recently said that he is “very bullish” on dogecoin and that the meme cryptocurrency has “no risk of it having any regulatory issues ever.”

Referencing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW), Buterin replied to Su:

Personally, I hope that doge can switch to PoS soon, perhaps using Ethereum code. I also hope they don’t cancel the 5b/year annual PoW issuance, instead they put it in some kind of DAO that funds global public goods. Would fit well with dogecoin’s non-greedy wholesome ethos.

In June, Buterin also talked about potential cooperation between Ethereum and Dogecoin. “If Doge wants to somehow bridge to Ethereum, and then people can trade DOGE thousands of times a second inside of loopring, then that would be amazing,” the Ethereum co-founder opined. “I think if we can have a secure Doge-to-Ethereum bridge. That would be amazing, and then when Ethereum gets any scalability that works for Ethereum assets, you would be able to trade wrapped DOGE with very low transaction fees and very high speed as well,” he further said.

In August, the Dogecoin Foundation relaunched with Buterin as one of its board advisors, along with Jared Birchall, a close associate of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, another prominent dogecoin supporter.

Among numerous questions Buterin received as part of his Twitter experiment was whether he was likely to create another cryptocurrency. The Ethereum co-founder simply responded with “No.”

What do you think about Vitalik Buterin’s suggestions for Dogecoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

Bitcoin is now officially legal tender in El Salvador - Fast Company,"advertisement advertisement advertisement

The government even went a step further in promoting the cryptocurrency’s use by giving $30 in free bitcoins to citizens who sign up for its national digital wallet, known as Chivo, or “cool” in English. Foreigners who invest three bitcoins in the country—currently about $140,000—will be granted residency. Panama is considering following El Salvador’s lead. Does making bitcoin legal tender mean every store and merchant in El Salvador will now have to accept digital payments? If more countries do the same thing, what will this mean for consumers and businesses around the world?

As an economist who studies wealth and money, I believe that briefly explaining what legal tender is will help answer these questions. What is legal tender? Legal tender refers to money—typically coins and banknotes—that must be accepted if offered in payment of a debt. The front of every U.S. banknote states, “This note is legal tender for all debts public and private.” This statement has been enshrined in federal law in various forms since the late 1800s.

This is why many companies, such as airlines, accept payments exclusively by credit card, and many small retailers take only cash. As the U.S. Treasury points out, there is “no federal statute mandating that a private business, a person, or an organization must accept currency or coins as payment for goods or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether to accept cash unless there is a state law which says otherwise.” And this would be no different if the U.S. made bitcoin legal tender. Private businesses would not be required to accept it.

There is clearly some confusion in El Salvador over the issue, however. Its original bitcoin law, passed in June 2021, states that “every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service.” This led to protests and resulted in skepticism from economists and others. As a result, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele tweeted in August that businesses did not have to accept bitcoin. Why did El Salvador make bitcoin legal tender? El Salvador is betting that being the first to open its doors completely to bitcoin will help boost its economy.

NFTs boom anew as DOG coin becomes $550 million asset overnight - Economic Times,"The frenzy for digital artwork is breaking new ground as one of the Internet’s best-known memes gets turned into a near $550 million asset overnight.The DOG coin -- a fraction of the non-fungible token depicting the famous Doge meme -- has doubled in value in less than 24 hours of trading, according to CoinGecko data. That makes it one of the most valuable NFTs yet.PleasrDAO, the art collective that bought the NFT for about $4 million in June, started offering fractionalized ownership in the form of $DOG on Wednesday.The image of the Shiba Inu breed from Japan gave birth to Dogecoin -- the joke cryptocurrency that boomed to as much as $95 billion earlier this year in a rally that captivated Wall Street.NFT BoomWith 17 billion in existence, each DOG coin is worth about 3 cents and about one-fifth is in circulation, while 55% is owned by the original buyer.These are all signs of a market going bananas, after total NFT volume surged more than 10-fold last month to $3 billion on OpenSea. It’s also fodder for critics who see pump-and-dump risks rampant across the industry, where success is primarily driven by social-media hype and ownership can sometimes be concentrated in the hands of a few holders.While the assets are by definition unique, traders can now speculate on fractionalized tokens, or shares of NFTs, that are traded on popular decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Sushiswap. Put another way, owning a $DOG coin is a bit like buying a chunk of an artwork that you can trade on the Nasdaq In another case of NFT mania, the latest Internet favorite is Loot (for Adventurers), a collection of images of texts naming a random assortment of items in video games -- anything from gloves to a dragon’s crown.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/nfts-boom-anew-as-dog-coin-becomes-550-million-asset-overnight/articleshow/85921037.cms,2021-09-04,Economic Times,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85921017,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-45680,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",none
Delta police issue warning about cryptocurrency after 6 investors fall victim to scams - CTV News Vancouver,"VANCOUVER -- Police in Delta are warning residents thinking about investing in cryptocurrency to do their due diligence, after receiving six complaints about scams in recent weeks.

Most of the complaints were made in August, according to a news release from the Delta Police Department.

""Unfortunately their losses have been significant, ranging from just under $5,000 to over $100,000 in one file,"" police said in their release.

Police said there are ""a number of common factors"" in the six files that have been reported to them.

In most of the cases, the scammers contacted the victims through online platforms - such as dating sites and chat apps - and established a relationship with them.

""Investors were typically encouraged to e-transfer funds from their bank accounts to mobile wallets, and from there to unknown accounts,"" Delta police said. ""When victims tried to withdraw their 'profits' or investment, the money was either gone, or the victim was informed they needed to pay considerable additional fees to access their money.""

Police said would-be investors should research the name of the investment company or website they're considering to see if anyone else has been scammed. Investors should also avoid taking advice from people online who they've never met, police said.

For reputable information for investors, Delta police recommend visiting the websites of the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Canadian Securities Administrators.",https://bc.ctvnews.ca/mobile/delta-police-issue-warning-about-cryptocurrency-after-6-investors-fall-victim-to-scams-1.5574115,2021-09-05,CTV News Vancouver,https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1717992.1394149852!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,none
Bitcoin miners and oil and gas execs mingled at a secretive meetup in Houston – here's what they talked about - CNBC,"Bitcoin enthusiasts, miners, and oil & gas execs gathered at a meetup in Houston to talk about the future of bitcoin mining.

HOUSTON – On a residential back street of Houston, in a 150,000 square-foot warehouse safeguarding high-end vintage cars, 200 oil and gas execs and bitcoin miners mingled, drank beer, and talked shop on a recent Wednesday night in August. These two groups of people may seem as though they are at opposite ends of the professional and social spectrums, but their worlds are colliding – fast. As it turns out, the industries make for compatible bedfellows. Just take Hayden Griffin Haby III, an oilman turned bitcoiner. The Texas native and father of three has spent 14 years in oil and gas, and he epitomizes what this monthly meetup is all about. Haby started as a surface landman where he brokered land contracts, and later, ran his own oil company. But for the last nine months, he's exclusively been in the business of mining bitcoin. As Haby describes it, he was ""orange pilled"" in November 2020 – a term used to describe the process of convincing a fiat-minded person that they are missing out by not investing in bitcoin. A month later, he co-founded Limpia Creek Technologies, which powers bitcoin mining rigs with flared, vented, and stranded natural gas assets. ""When I heard that you could make this much money per MCF (a metric used to measure natural gas), instead of just burning it up into the atmosphere, thanks to the whole 'bitcoin mining thing,' I couldn't look away,"" Haby said. ""You can't unsee that."" When China kicked out all its crypto miners this spring – an exodus which Haby calls the ""Chexit"" – that poured kerosene on the flames. ""This is an opportunity we didn't think was coming,"" he said. Haby tells CNBC they are already seeing demand rushing to Texas, and he is convinced that the state is poised to capture most of the Chinese hashrate looking for a new home on friendlier shores. Bitcoin miners care most about finding cheap sources of electricity, so Texas – with its crypto-friendly politicians, deregulated power grid, and crucially, abundance of inexpensive power sources – is a virtually perfect fit. The union becomes even more harmonious when miners connect their rigs to otherwise stranded energy, like natural gas going to waste on oil fields across Texas. ""This is Texas, boys. We got what you need, so come on down,"" said Haby. ""We are sitting on the energy capital of the world."" ""I think Kevin Costner said it best: 'If you build it, they will come,'"" said Haby.

An underground meetup of bitcoin miners and oil & gas execs was held at a 150,000 square-foot warehouse safeguarding high-end vintage cars.

Mobilizing a movement

Parker Lewis is one of Texas' de facto bitcoin ambassadors. Everyone knows him. Everyone likes him. And virtually any bitcoiner you ask refers to him as the future mayor of Austin. Lewis is an executive at Unchained Capital, a bitcoin-native financial services firm. He isn't in politics – yet — but he is hustling across the state of Texas to spread the good word on the world's biggest cryptocurrency. In May, the Houston Bitcoin Meetup consisted of only 20 people in a fluorescent-lit conference room in an office. Then Lewis decided to get involved. ""I just knew Houston would be prime to explode because of the energy connection to mining – if we organized a good meetup,"" Lewis told CNBC. ""It's also key to Texas being the bitcoin capital of the world."" His efforts are paying off. Wednesday's meetup drew more than 200 attendees from across the state of Texas, as well as California, Colorado, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New York, Australia and the UK. The buzz was electric on Wednesday night. You had to shout to be heard. And no one in the room mentioned any cryptocurrency beside bitcoin. There was also an unmistakable air of stealth – and FOMO. The people who showed up to this event did so, at least in part, because they didn't want to get left behind. Capturing excess and otherwise wasted natural gas from drilling sites and then using that energy to mine bitcoin is still firmly in the category of avant-garde tech. Haby, who's affable and an open book on most things, clams up when it comes to sharing the location of his company's mining sites. ""West Texas"" is as much as Haby would give CNBC, though if the name ""Limpia Creek"" is any indication, that would place them 100 miles due north of Big Bend National Park. His secrecy was par for the course that evening.

Oilmen, turned bitcoin miners, Griffin Haby with Conner Murphree and Jordan Kuntz at one of their bitcoin mining sites in Texas.

Bitcoin miner Alejandro de la Torre was born in Spain, but he's spent years minting bitcoin all over the world, most recently in China. When Beijing cracked down on all things crypto, De La Torre got a call from his boss at 3 A.M. telling him he had to go to Texas. He was in Austin the next day. Since then, he's been shipping his new-generation mining gear to the U.S. in bulk. ""It's all through ships and from the Pacific side,"" De La Torre told CNBC. ""The port depends on the location of where the rigs will end up."" That was as much as De La Torre would divulge, because, as he explains it, any further details about the destination, or the gear itself, could give his competitors an edge. Bitcoin believers care a lot about privacy, as do the oil and gas guys. Some cited non-disclosure agreements as a reason to speak to CNBC in vague platitudes about business deals. Others were only willing to share their thoughts on the condition of anonymity. And some attendees worried about their job security should their employer find out they were there. These weren't tycoons -- they were mostly up-and-coming young execs, hungry to get ahead and make a name by taking a gamble on bitcoin mining.

Oil and gas meets bitcoin

For years, oil and gas companies have struggled with the problem of what to do when they accidentally hit a natural gas formation while drilling for oil. Whereas oil can easily be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline. If a drilling site is right next door to a pipeline, they chuck the gas in and take whatever cash the buyer on the other end is willing to pay that day. ""There's no choice. There's no middle finger. Whatever gas comes out that day has to be sold,"" explained Haby. But if it's 20 miles from a pipeline, things start to get more complicated. More often than not, the gas well won't be big enough to warrant the time and expense of building an entirely new pipeline. If a driller can't immediately find a way to sell the stash of natural gas, most look to dispose of it on site. One method is to vent it, which releases methane directly into the air – a poor choice for the environment, as its greenhouse effects are shown to be much stronger than carbon dioxide. A more environmentally friendly option is to flare it, which means actually lighting the gas on fire. ""Chemistry is amazing,"" explained Adam Ortolf, who heads up business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities. ""When CH4, or methane, combusts, the only exhaust is CO2 and H2O vapor. That's literally the same thing that comes out of my mouth when I exhale,"" continued Ortolf. But Ortolf points out, flares are only 75 to 90% efficient. ""Even with a flare, some of the methane is being vented without being combusted,"" he said. This is when on-site bitcoin mining can prove to be especially impactful. When the methane is run into an engine or generator, 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air, according to Ortolf. ""But nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money, because generators cost money to acquire and maintain,"" he said. ""So unless it's economically sustainable, producers won't internally combust the gas.""

A panel of bitcoin miners and oil & gas execs share what it's like to mine bitcoin in Texas.

Bitcoin makes it economically sustainable for oil and gas companies to combust their methane rather than externally combust it with a flare. ""There is no such thing as stranded gas anymore,"" said Haby. But Ortolf has taken years to convince people that parking a trailer full of ASICs on an oil and gas field is a smart and financially sound idea. ""In 2018, I got laughed out of the room when I talked about mining bitcoin on flared gas,"" said Ortolf. ""The concept of bringing hydrocarbons to market without a counterparty was laughable."" Fast forward three years, and business at Upstream, a company founded by lead engineer Steve Barbour, is booming. It now works with 140 bitcoin mines across North America. ""This is the best gift the oil and gas industry could've gotten,"" said Ortolf. ""They were leaving a lot of hydrocarbons on the table, but now, they're no longer limited by geography to sell energy."" It is also helping to curtail the overall carbon footprint of some of these oil and gas sites. Recent production stats show that in the U.S. alone about 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas is wasted on a daily basis. And these are just the reported numbers, so the actual figures are likely higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin miners get what they want most: cheap electricity.

Cryptocurrencies vs Fixed Deposits: The debate dominating drawing rooms in India - Economic Times,"ET Exclusive: Here's how govt could tax your Cryptocurrency investment The main problem with the taxation of cryptocurrencies is that there is no clarity on what cryptocurrencies are. The tax department and investors are in a quandary over how to calculate gains on cryptocurrency. The draft bill tries to answer that. It will define cryptocurrency and will spell out what is allowed and what is not. Sachin Dave with exclusive details. Watch.

The Indian government and Indians have always been into savings. Unlike the westerners, India has high family values. The blood relations and family members are always there to support each other - also financially.The bread earner of the family saves for the future of the child(ren). In India, it is never like working for 40 hours a week, being paid as per the hours and chilling on the weekend and being broke by Monday morning. India's tradition of investment is a long term game that considers generations ahead.The Indian government realised this soon after independence and hence created a lot of schemes that come as retirement plans. The banks that come under the Reserve bank of India also come up with policies and plans to facilitate their customers into long term planning that involves minimum risk and a decent investment.Indians have been diverse in terms of their culture. But, the one thing that binds every Indian is the love for gold and silver . And again, traditionally speaking, gold is the symbol of Laxmi, the goddess of wealth. Gold is gifted to the bride and groom during the marriage. Gold is also worn as a piece of jewellery. Financially speaking, it is holding an asset that can be used in thick and thin for generations ahead.Another very popular financial instrument that Indians invest in is the FD or the fixed deposit. But with the new advancement of digital currency, will an average Indian adopt crypto? Let us see the differences and similarities.When you invest in FD, there are different sections under which you can invest your money in. For this investment that you declare, the government is notified of your strategy and you might get some consideration under tax benefit. On the other hand, the Indian government is not a too crypto pro, and hence, there is no tax exemption on the profits you make from investing in crypto.Government-supported: For creating an FD account with your bank, the steps are quite easy. A loaded bank account is good to go to create an FD account. While on the other hand, crypto investment requires you to create an account with a trading platform, that, in a normal case, is not encouraged by any government.As per the policy chosen by you, your bank and your tenure of FD, you are bound to get a fixed return. This usually does not change. Even if it does, it does not change too frequently. Also, the change in the percentage of return is not too much to give a shock to the investor. On the other hand, crypto rides a roller coaster. One moment the returns are doubled and the next moment you lose half of the money you invested. The frequency of change and the magnitude of change is humongous.FDs are long term plans and the entry and exit points are generally continuous till maturity. People generally do not exit their FD plan before it matures. No transaction happens and hence there is no transaction cost. On the contrary, since the crypto market is volatile, people make quick decisions. They enter, stay for some time, exit and then come back when the prices hit deep low. The number of entry and exit points is way too many and this incurs a lot of transactional costs.No need for any trading or exchange platform: For starting an FD account, you just need a bank account. And, having a bank account has been encouraged by the PM Jan Dhan Yojna. For investing in crypto, the user needs to have a verified account with a trading platform, link the bank account and then start to invest.FDs are an investment that people do not touch. People either start an FD for their retirement or they let it mature. The investment of crypto is not untouched. The amount ascertained for the investment in the crypto is every easily moved and circulated for investing in other cryptos or to encash into the local currency.FDs are long term plans. So is the crypto investment. But only pro-crypto investors understand this and are unshakable. Hence, even though both FD and cryptos are long term investment vehicles, many use the latter for short term gain.FDs are not rare. Do you want to open an account? Great! Go ahead. Do you want to mine bitcoin after 2140? Sorry, you cannot. Crypto comes with a finite supply and hence are rare. FDs are run on traditional money and we can have any number of traditional money notes as we want.This supports the above point. There is no mining or extra effort to convert your traditional money to be invested in FD. For cryptos, you need to mine new tokens to maintain their circulation or someone mines and sells them so that others can invest in them.FDs are the most secure, least risk involving financial planning method. Once you deposit money, you can forget it till it matures. Cryptos occupy the investors' time and attention. You lose your focus, you might lose a lot!As the inflation rate is higher, traditional instruments like FDs and RDs don't provide great relief. Even though crypto gets your heart beat faster, a person with good research on crypto can enter the market, stay for the time, make amazing money and exit intelligently. He/she doesn't wait for the 5-year tenure to get over.Indians love to invest money in the first place, love to invest for the long term and want their money to grow. While some people are risk-takers, some are more traditional. Investment strategies are like food choices. It depends from individual to individual. One that works for you might not work for your friend. Hence, it is always advisable to understand one's needs and wants and decide what best fits their goal.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/cryptocurrencies-vs-fixed-deposits-the-debate-dominating-drawing-rooms-in-india/articleshow/85920299.cms,2021-09-04,Economic Times,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85920307,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58030,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",none
"Crypto banking and decentralized finance, explained - Economic Times","The development of Bitcoin and thousands of other cryptocurrencies in a little over a decade has changed the definition of money — and spawned a parallel universe of alternative financial services, allowing crypto businesses to move into traditional banking territory.Here’s what is happening in the fast-growing crypto finance industry, a sector that has officials in Washington sounding alarm bells.A: Most notably, lending and borrowing. Investors can earn interest on their holdings of digital currencies — often a lot more than they could on cash deposits in a bank — or borrow with crypto as collateral to back a loan. Crypto loans generally involve no credit checks as transactions are backed by digital assets.A: The market is quickly being flooded with businesses from the vaguely familiar to science fictionlike entities. They run the gamut from BlockFi, which offers interest-bearing accounts like a bank and has state lender licenses, and Kraken Bank, which was granted a Wyoming bank charter and hopes to soon take retail deposits, to markets controlled by computer code and devised to be governed by users through a token distribution structure. Compound, a decentralized, automated lending and borrowing system began in 2018 and now has more than $18 billion in assets earning interest.A: Superficially, some look similar. Take the BlockFi interest account, where consumers deposit cash or crypto and earn monthly interest, as if at a bank. But one big difference is the interest rate — depositors can earn a yield more than 100 times higher on BlockFi than on average bank accounts.Those rewards come with risks. Deposits are not guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. “Cyberattacks, extreme market conditions, or other operational or technical difficulties” could lead to a temporary or permanent halt on withdrawals or transfers, the company cautions in fine print. Some regulators and lawmakers worry that those warnings are not prominent enough and that consumers need stronger protections.A: Traditional banks lend out their customers’ deposits and pay clients a slice of the earnings as interest. Crypto outfits take a similar approach: They pool deposits to offer loans and give interest to depositors. But by law, banks are required to have reserves to ensure that even if some loans go bad, customers can still withdraw funds, whereas cryptobanks do not have the same reserve requirements and the institutions they lend to can take risky bets.BlockFi, for example, lends to hedge funds and other institutional investors who exploit flaws in crypto markets to make fast money without actually holding risky assets, betting on discrepancies between actual crypto values and crypto futures. When successful, their speculation generates returns that help fuel the higher, riskier consumer yields.A: Crypto is very volatile, making it less practical for transactions like payments or loans. That’s where stablecoins come in. They are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets, commonly the dollar. They are meant to provide the steady value of government-issued money in digital form for blockchain transactions, but they are issued by private entities. Popular dollar-tied tokens include Tether and USD Coin. The number of stablecoins in circulation globally has jumped from $29 billion in January to $117 billion as of early September, according to The Block, a publication dedicated to cryptocurrency.To keep the value of government-issued money stable, central bankers manage supply and demand and ensure that there are ample reserves. Stablecoin issuers are supposed to similarly hold and monitor reserves. But there is no guarantee they actually hold the one-to-one dollar backing they claim. Some authorities fear a sudden surge in withdrawals could lead to a collapse in one of those assets, putting consumers, financial companies and possibly the broader economy at risk. Others suggest a central bank digital currency would render stablecoins irrelevant.A: Central bankers are examining the potential for issuance of a government-issued cryptocurrency. That would theoretically offer the convenience of crypto with the reliability of money controlled by a central bank. Many countries, including the United States, are considering developing a central bank digital currency. Because a stablecoin aims to do in digital form what government money does — provide a stable value — a U.S. digital dollar could undermine the private money minters of the cryptosphere.“You wouldn’t need stablecoins, you wouldn’t need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital U.S. currency — I think that’s one of the stronger arguments in its favor,” the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, said in July.Stablecoin issuers say the government will not catch up to the innovations in the market for years — if at all. Meanwhile, the system will become more dependent on stablecoins, and it is unclear whether markets awash in those assets will abandon them altogether for a potential FedCoin.A: Decentralized finance , or DeFi, loosely describes an alternative finance ecosystem where consumers transfer, trade, borrow and lend cryptocurrency, theoretically independently of traditional financial institutions and the regulatory structures that have been built around Wall Street and banking. The DeFi movement aims to “disintermediate” finance, using computer code to eliminate the need for trust and middlemen from transactions.Practically speaking, users are not engaging with a financial services company — at least not one that collects identifying information or claims custody of their assets. It’s a computer-controlled market that automatically executes transactions, like issuing loans backed by crypto or paying interest on holdings.DeFi platforms are structured to become independent from their developers and backers over time and to ultimately be governed by a community of users whose power comes from holding the protocol’s tokens.By comparison, centralized finance, or CeFi, businesses more closely resemble traditional finance, or TradFi, where consumers enter into an agreement with a company like BlockFi that collects information about them, requires them to turn over their crypto and also serves as a central point for regulators.A: Ethereum is the primary network that developers use to build decentralized platforms for crypto borrowing, lending, trading and more. Ether is the cryptocurrency, or token, used to pay to operate on the network. Because the Ethereum blockchain is so popular and made it possible to create new offerings, Ether is widely used and crypto fans are enthusiastic about its worth. It is the second-most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, at more than $460 billion as of early September.A: DeFi cuts out the third parties that U.S. financial regulators rely on to ensure market integrity. Licensed operators like banks and brokers play a quasi-governmental role in traditional finance, collecting and reporting data to the authorities, including information on capital gains on investments made by their clients, to ensure taxes are paid. Their participation in the market depends on following lots of rules.By contrast, DeFi programs are unregulated apps created by coders interested in capital markets. Users’ assets can and have been hacked, and not all of the operations are built in good faith. “Rug pulls,” when developers abandon programs after investors contribute significant assets, are notorious in DeFi.A: Innovators argue that crypto fosters financial inclusion. Consumers can earn unusually high return on their holdings, unlike at banks. One in 10 American adults say they do not have a checking account and about a quarter are “underbanked” and unable to qualify for loans. Crypto businesses say they serve their needs and, outside the United States, provide financial stability for customers in countries with volatile government-issued currencies.Crypto finance gives people long excluded by traditional institutions the opportunity to engage in transactions quickly, cheaply and without judgment, industry advocates say. Because crypto backs their loans, the services generally require no credit checks, although some take customer identity information for tax reporting and anti-fraud purposes. On a DeFi protocol, users’ personal identities are generally not shared, since they are judged solely by the value of their crypto.A: Banking officials are sprinting to catch up with the many developments in crypto and are trying to slow the industry’s momentum. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is reviewing conditional banking charters granted to crypto businesses shortly after an industry executive left the agency as acting comptroller.Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is calling for Congress to give regulators more authority to oversee new entities. And the Fed will issue a report in early September on the potential benefits and detriments of the United States minting a digital dollar.A: Crypto unexpectedly drew attention in the Senate during negotiations over the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which included a tax-reporting clause that defined the word “broker” in crypto transactions. The industry pushed back, arguing that the language was too vague and, in so doing, brought focus on the many players in the sector who elude traditional definitions.It will be perhaps years before Congress addresses the many questions raised by blockchain’s alternative banking services. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., introduced comprehensive legislation this summer that would tackle the range of issues raised by digital assets. But it has so far gotten little scrutiny.A: Some regulators and innovators argue that new technology demands a new approach, saying novel risks can be addressed without necessarily crimping innovation.For example, instead of mandating that DeFi protocols maintain the reserves of a bank and collect customer information, officials might create new kinds of requirements devised for the technology and products, like code audits and risk parameters.Questions of identity, which are crucial to fighting financial fraud, could be addressed by flipping the old script. Instead of starting with specifics — collecting the identity of individuals — law enforcers could take the broad view, said J. Christopher Giancarlo, a former chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, using artificial intelligence and data analysis to monitor suspicious activity and working back to track identity.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/crypto-banking-and-decentralized-finance-explained/articleshow/85941769.cms,2021-09-05,Economic Times,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85941782,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-192300,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",none
Australian government warns cryptocurrency investors - Micky News,"The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has issued a warning on the country’s crypto investors and urged them to be cautious on crypto products from unlicensed companies.

According to Australian law, crypto exchanges would not be provided by a license unless they offer a financial product. Also, ASIC does not consider any crypto or token to be a form of financial product.

The Commission has released this warning in response to the mounting complaints from Australians who have used financial services from unlicensed platforms.

The complainants said that when they traded options and futures on these platforms, they experienced big losses from their investments. But a lot of people from crypto trading circles are doubting that sending this warning through a press release is the best thing to do to deal with the situation.

Problematic situation

“Press releases with no data but containing warnings are problematic. Readers need to understand what the problem and real risk they are facing,” Michael Bacina, a board member of Blockchain Australia, said.

Since the Colonial Pipeline hacking incident in the U.S., where cryptocurrencies were demanded as a form of ransom, governments all over the world became more aware of cryptos’ possible risks.

Crypto warning

According to Bacina, Australians should be more careful in interacting with offshore businesses or unlicensed financial services, because the possibility of big losses is imminent.

He emphasized that the protection provided by the country’s regulatory system may not be available for those who are dealing with offshore entities. This could also discourage Australians from interacting with these businesses because they wouldn’t have a safety net to fall on.

"Are we in a bubble? We couldn’t be further from it, Ark Invest CEO Says - CryptoPotato","Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, recently spoke about the market outlook, taking the opportunity to give some love to Bitcoin and the ecosystem of industries that are developing around cryptocurrencies.

Speaking with Yahoo Finance, the financial expert assured that the future looks bright for the world of cryptocurrencies. Wood disagrees with billionaire investor John Paulson’s recent criticism of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, claiming that Bitcoin is managing to surpass gold as a store of value in this digital age.

What we (Ark Investment) think he’s missing about cryptocurrencies is they’re much more than a store of value or digital gold. Bitcoin is a new, global monetary system that is completely decentralized and not subject to the whims of policymakers.

A few days ago, Paulson told Bloomberg that in his view, cryptocurrencies would eventually have to go to zero

I’ll have a lot of people that disagree with this, but I would think you should not invest in cryptocurrencies. Ultimately I think cryptocurrencies, regardless of where they are trading today, whether it will go up from here or down, will eventually prove to be worthless.

Cathie Wood Believes The Crypto World is Far From Being a Bubble

Wood also spoke about her investments in Coinbase and Robinhood, two of the leading regulated exchanges in the United States.

At first, she said that Robin Hood’s shift to cryptocurrencies proved to be very positive for its business model, and although the SEC may be trying to exert more control, she does not expect any adverse changes to alarm investors in the near future.

ADVERTISEMENT

On the other hand, Cathie Wood emphasized how comfortable she was with her investment in Coinbase. This is the only publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange and is a global benchmark for compliance in general.

For Cathie Wood markets are not in a price bubble. Wood believes that cryptocurrencies are a generational phenomenon, and the crypto industry is just growing up as the technology evolves. She is sure that the current bull run is far from over and cited predictions that mention at least 10 years of general growth:

“Are we in a bubble? We couldn’t be further from it. The average investor doesn’t understand how provocative these next five to 15 years are going to be, as these S curves feed one another and enter exponential growth trajectories that we have never seen before.”

Bitcoin Needs Clearer Regulations

Cathie Wood is not a cyberpunk, nor does she want to bring down the current financial system. On the contrary, she advocates for precise regulation as a fundamental factor for the growth of cryptocurrency adoption at a global level.

For Cathie Wood, regulations are a good thing. Yet, she asserts that the underlying problem lies in the lack of consensus among the various regulatory bodies on the nature of cryptocurrencies.

“If regulators get together and agree what exactly these cryptocurrencies are, how to define them, that will be a good thing. Certainty will be a good thing for this ecosystem.”

Currently, the cryptocurrency industry in the United States is in a delicate situation precisely because of the diversity of criteria among regulators. The controversial $1 Trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill could entail quite substantial risks for cryptocurrency businesses looking to establish in the country. Also, the expectations surrounding the US political scene have a strong impact on the cryptocurrency markets.

Perhaps technology is traveling faster than politics right now, but eventually they both will meet.",https://cryptopotato.com/are-we-in-a-bubble-we-couldnt-be-further-from-it-ark-invest-ceo-says/,2021-09-05,CryptoPotato,https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blockchain_invest.jpg,none
"The CEO of a crypto research firm says bitcoin is going to $100,000 by year-end - Business Insider South Africa","The CEO of Chainalysis, Michael Gronager, is bullish on bitcoin and sees it reaching $100,000 by year-end.

""Usually you say the moon is the limit. We can go up beyond that as well,"" he said.

For more stories go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.

Michael Gronager - CEO of the cryptocurrency research firm Chainalysis - is highly bullish on bitcoin, and says it will soar past $100,000 by year-end.

In comments made during an interview with Bloomberg, Gronager referenced bitcoin's early-summer sell-off as a consolidation period that coincided with network improvements and other helpful upgrades across the crypto landscape.

""In the bear market, a lot of interesting things have been built, and that basically facilitates a new bull market,"" he said. ""Yes, I think we're still in a bull market. I think we can see above $100k by the end of the year.""

He added: ""For most of the cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum - the most stable ones - we just need to see that trend, where they grow year-over-year. Sometimes they grow faster than others.""

""Long term, usually you say the moon is the limit. We can go up beyond that as well,"" Gronger concluded.

Bitcoin is currently trading just above the key $50,000 threshold, climbing as much as 3% to $51,033.97 on Friday.

The cryptocurrency is now up 74%% year-to-date and 369% in the past 12 months.

Cryptocurrencies draw Mafia online in search for ill-gotten gains - The Star Online,"ROME: Those involved in organised crime can't afford to fall behind the times, especially when it comes to raking in cash.



So cryptocurrency is not only an issue for people who are involved in technology and finance, but also for those trying to either sustain or break up criminal networks.



More and more, Italy's Mafia is turning to digital currency for its illegal operations, for example.



""All criminal organisations, even those like the Mafia, have an interest in using these instruments for their business,"" said an official with the DIA, Italy's anti-Mafia police, in an interview with dpa. He asked that his name not be used for safety reasons.



The best-known cryptocurrency is bitcoin, which is purely digital, meaning there's no bill or coin to be held. Instead, the money is made up of cryptological codes of numbers and letters. They are generally decentralised, with transactions taking place directly between users.



That means the transactions do not involve financial regulators or government guidelines. Users employ something called a blockchain, a complex kind of database, to make sure that bitcoins aren't duplicated.



That's the kind of thing that appeals to the Mafia, which is how it became involved in digital finance, said the DIA official from his office on the outskirts of Rome. Transactions with digital currencies are fast and offer security, as well as a kind of anonymity, all of which are advantageous for illegal business.



That makes it hard to find anyone involved in any business using cryptocurrency. Police tend not to reveal data about trade volumes, investigations or damages linked to any illegal business.



For example, the 'Ndrangheta Mafia, based in Calabria, use cryptocurrencies for trade with Latin American cartels, according to the most recent DIA report to lawmakers, focused on the first half of 2020. The 'Ndrangheta focuses primarily on the cocaine trade and has made use of digital money to ease transactions with Colombian cartels.



And there's more, according to the report.



""The Mafia seems to be directing its attention to cybercrime and the possibilities of the dark web, which are both hard to monitor, in order to direct large sums of financial resources to completely illegal ends.""



By turning money raised illegally into cryptocurrency and then using it in illegal parts of the Internet, like the dark web, the Mafia can launder money or pay bills without attracting notice.



Still, the police have enjoyed moments of success, despite the anonymity and wide reach of the web. At the end of April, Italian police brought in more than two dozen members of the Nigerian organised group Black Aze in connection to illegal migration and the drug trade. They stand accused of using bitcoin to buy fake credit cards online, which they used to buy yet more merchandise.



In another case, in August 2019, police put four Ukrainians into handcuffs in the Tuscan city of Lucca. They were accused of being part of an organisation using the dark web to buy drugs like cocaine, LSD and marijuana from Germany and the Netherlands using bitcoin.



According to the DIA report, police are bulking up the number of units capable of Internet investigations, with more collaboration with the country's finance police and national police forces.



One goal is to make sure investigators gather evidence in a legally sound fashion, making sure data is not subject to tampering, a member of the Carabinieri, the national police, told La Repubblica newspaper in June. That's the only way to make sure this evidence stands up in court.



German police have also gained experience with cryptocurrencies.



""The use of cryptocurrencies for online payments in the course of crimes, such as those related to customs, has climbed significantly,"" according to a statement from the country's main customs agency.



Investigators say bitcoin and another currency, monero, are the favourites.



Customs officials also say they've seen that cryptocurrencies are being used for crimes that involve finding ways to anonymise the purchase and shipping of illegal goods.



Doing so allows criminals to disguise their identity and location, since the payment goes from one user to another and not through any bank, which would normally alert authorities if anything strange popped up. – dpa

"NEO Price Prediction 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 2025 Trading Analysis Chart And Review - Upto Brain","The cryptocurrency industry is stocked with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Stellar competitors, all of whom have marketed their offerings as the greatest thing since sliced bread. The problem, however, was that the availability, openness, and exorbitant transaction costs were all present in digital assets. As DeFi takes the spotlight, it seems that blockchains and science-backed cryptos will be lead by algorithms.

Neo Price

Blockchain algorithm, with NEO functioning as the base currency for all transactions on the platform, including financial services, applications, and gaming. The NEO community has strong faith in the coin’s potential. NEO cryptocurrency fosters optimism and convenience, helping people globally while imprints on the technical and functional eco-space. Factors other than those previously mentioned affect NEO’s price, such as the connection between supply and demand, a centuries-old phenomenon of conflicting supply and demand that operates for NEO.

What are the new ventures at Neo Lab?

Neo has launched its public blockchain N3, the third generation of its product. It’s the perfect moment for Ethereum, which is struggling to catch its breath. With NEO’s support, the network’s transaction speed may be raised from 1000 TPS to 5000 TPS, with the gas costs being cut by 100 times. It will also integrate the NEO network with a decentralized file storage option and oracle solutions.

Neo Price Prediction

When NEO currency was first launched, it did not get much acceptance among the general public as a trading asset; it required NEO to establish that trust and make progress toward it. Unquestionably, it emerged as a leader, and subsequently, its price has been stable over the past several months, with the coins now selling at about $115 per coin over the last 24 hours. Several cryptocurrency experts believe that NEO has tremendous potential.

NEO Price Prediction 2021

Not only was the year 2020 a game-changer for NEO, but it was also a game-changer for most currencies, including cryptocurrencies and fiat. The world economy experienced a dramatic downturn as a result of the Pandemic. The year 2020, on the other hand, offered a slew of positive developments for NEO.

Read More: SOL Price Prediction

The coin maintained its upward and forward motion. In 2020, the price of NEO was hovering around $20 per coin. Since then, NEO has significantly impacted the market sentiment phenomena, with the cryptocurrency presently trading around $115. By current market emotions, the NEO forecast for the future takes a positive tack.

NEO Price Prediction In 2022

The NEO price forecast for 2021 is considered optimistic since it coincides with the same positive trend as the previous year’s projection. Following the current pattern of NEO/USD, mainly how it is trading inside the boundaries of a symmetrical triangle, it is clear that the price of NEO may run parallel to and along the same positive trend lines as the price of NEO. When the sequence of consecutive peaks and dips is considered, the 2021 NEO price growth demonstrates a positive trend amid the retreating Pandemic scenario, reaching $140 in 2022.

NEO Price Prediction In 2023

According to the analysis of shorter and longer-term price patterns, the value of NEO has been deviating from its usual course every couple of years. As a result, probably, the end of 2022 or the beginning of 2023 will not be favourable for NEO in terms of escalation, particularly if competitors gain momentum or if markets play hide and seek in trade. Even with the ups and downs of the market, the NEO price prediction does not seem to impact the price of the cryptocurrency significantly.

NEO Price Prediction In 2024

It is predicted that NEO will once again dominate the cryptocurrency market, with a price-performance of $180, even though a jaw-dropping potential does not exist. That bulls will ride the crypto market. This demonstrates that NEO has the complete ability to maintain and expand continuously in the foreseeable future, and traders and investors will have no need to be concerned about losing money.

NEO Price Prediction In 2025

This year may be remembered as the year of the benchmark since the price of NEO is expected to exceed $180 in all likelihood. As a result of widespread acceptance and technical analysis, the NEO currency is expected to reach approximately $200 by 2025, representing an unprecedented increase in value.

Popular Minecraft YouTuber loses channel after hackers promote crypto scam - Dexerto,"Fortnite and Minecraft content creator PainfulPVP has had his YouTube channel deleted after hackers tried to pull off a Cryptocurrency scam to his followers.

James Garrod, known as PainfulPVP to his fanbase, is a Fortnite and Minecraft content creator. Amassing a huge 31 million views during his YouTube tenure, the creator has specifically become a staple with the Minecraft community. However, Garrod has found himself in a strange situation.

While some crypto scams have just used the names of popular creators to get some traction, this one went a step further and took over Garrod’s channel for good.

Hackers are promoting crypto

In a random turn of events, Garrod’s once 500,000 subscriber strong channel, was turned into a hub for cryptocurrency.

Promoting Ethereum – a nearly 10-year old crypto that has recently caught the attention of tech moguls like Elon Musk – in the form of livestreams, the hackers were purporting that it’ll hit $40,000 stakes in ads to Garrod’s followers.

Since the initial hack took place, Garrod has tried to resolve the situation. Calling for help over on his Twitter feed, the creator has sought guidance from official entities. “Hey YouTube…someone just hacked my YouTube, DM asap please” Garrod’s calls for help began.

Hey @YouTube @TeamYouTube @YouTubeCreators my account has been hacked, they deleted all of my videos and are trying to scam my fans, PLEASE HELP! My account was https://t.co/9vVeZ9uOPo but they changed it. — Painful (@JamesGarrod7) September 3, 2021

Hey @YouTube @YouTubeCreators someone just hacked my YouTube, DM asap please. — Painful (@JamesGarrod7) September 3, 2021

After numerous tweets calling for a response, Garrod ultimately had his channel deleted after it violated YouTube’s community guidelines. “I’ve reached out to the YouTube hijack team and I’m hoping to hear from them sometime soon,” he tweeted, thanking the community for trying to chip in and help him out.

YouTube responded to Garrod, requesting the Minecraft creator take the discussion into private messaging. It is unclear whether the creator will be able to restore his channel in the future.

Sorry to hear this – we've sent you a DM for the next steps, and we'll wait for your reply there. — TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) September 3, 2021

For now, the scammers have been temporarily thwarted. Fans of PainfulPVP have been showing their support, tweeting messages like: “Don’t worry everything happens for a reason and it’ll be resolved.”

Another passionate fan added: “I’m sure that you will get your channel back just be patient.”

Since taking the discussion into privacy, no further updates have been released on the status of Garrod’s channel.",https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/popular-minecraft-youtuber-loses-channel-after-hackers-promote-crypto-scam-1645851/,2021-09-04,Dexerto,https://www.dexerto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04/PainfulPVP-feat-image.jpg,none
"Harrah's New Orleans Casino Requires Vaccination Card, On-Line Gambling Surges - Cryptonews","Disclaimer: The text below is an advertorial article that was not written by Cryptonews.com journalists.

Cryptocurrency is moving from virtual exchanges to the gaming sphere as on-line casinos start accepting the digital currency. The move could spell lower participation rates for brick-and-mortar establishments as gamblers move to internet games due to the pandemic.

Notably, New Orleans-based Harrah’s now requires that their guests be vaccinated to play. This is the first U.S. casino to enforce new restrictions for guests as cases continue to rise across the country.

Gambling Enters the Cryptosphere

Gambling companies are replicating the in-person experience of betting in a luxury casino through virtual platforms. One of the advantages of going digital is the ability to accept and process payments with cryptocurrency. This also gives guests greater incentive to play as they earn tokens that can easily be redeemed for popular coins such as Bitcoin and ETH.

Additionally, companies create their own rewards system in which players earn native tokens and participate in a dividend pool. The more each player wagers, the greater number of native tokens they receive. At the end of a certain time frame, players receive shares of the casino’s revenue according to the amount of native tokens they hold.

One example is BTC365, a licensed casino created specifically for crypto holders. The platform accepts Bitcoin, ETH and USDT, but also supports additional tokens such as Dogecoin. The Las Vegas experience is not lost, however, and players have access to everything available in a physical casino. Games such as roulette and poker, as well as the ability to play on several tables at once.

Where these companies shine is in innovating the gaming experience and making it specific to cryptocurrency. These ‘crypto games’ are designed with digital tokens in mind and are entirely original. These games, along with proprietary VIP and rewards systems incentivize players to play and rack up their points.

This list of benefits could convince players to leave physical casinos entirely. And if that’s not enough, many gambling houses are heeding the warnings from state governors and mayors to enforce stricter regulations. One example is Harrah’s in New Orleans which now requires guests be vaccinated after the announcement of state-wide mandates.

Harrah’s New Orleans Hotel and Casino Requires Covid Shots

The news that a vaccination card required by the casino would be the only way to enter came as the city announced tougher measures. New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell announced the new restrictions for all businesses including bars, restaurants, and gyms. Additionally, even larger open spaces where people gather such as fairgrounds and race tracks would fall under the mandate.

However, the mandate also allows flexibility under the new terms. Guests may also present negative Coronavirus test results to enter, as an alternative to getting the vaccine. The mandate covers any activity which is considered a “high transmission risk” for people over the age of 12.

Many businesses across the country are requiring their employees to be fully vaccinated after the FDA granted approval of Pfizers vaccine . The news may convince more people to get a vaccine which would grant them access to vaccination card required establishments.

Specifically, many casinos currently require their employees to either get the vaccine, or pay for their own Covid-19 tests. The average cost of these tests without insurance ranges from $100 to $200, which would make it much cheaper to get a vaccination card.

Las Vegas Following Suit

In Nevada, Governor Steve Sisolak commented on the possibility of establishing similar mandates as New Orleans. In a statement, Gov. Sisolak stated that while he didn’t necessarily want harsher restrictions, they could be a possibility if vaccination rates did not rise.

Las Vegas is also seeing some casinos and events taking matters into their own hands. The Life is Beautiful Music & Art Festival recently announced that they will require a vaccination card or else access could not be granted .

A post on the event’s Twitter page detailed their decision:

“Our most important duty as festival hosts is to keep you and your music-loving peers safe every festival weekend,” the post read. “We are putting extra measures in place for the 2021 festival to keep attendees safe from COVID-19”

Of course, with the popularity of Toto sites rising, there are also new fraudulent sites appearing. One way to play safely is through Mukcheck.com which creates a database of legitimate sites, as well as those considered fraudulent. Additionally, there are no covid restrictions, such as at Harrah’s as gameplay is completely online. This could be a new direction for gambler’s looking to escape the uncertainty of in-person gambling for the near future.

Curbing Restrictions with On-Line Gambling

For many who don’t want to take the vaccine or show negative Coronavirus test results, there is another option growing in popularity. Asian-based ‘ Toto ’ sites which host the largest on-line casinos offer a way to play from home, with all the luxuries guests expect.

Toto sites are secure and transparent, letting users create an account without the typical upfront costs of most online services. The sites offer anything from blackjack to poker, as well as slot machines and sports betting. One popular feature drawing many users is their high-stakes betting, called ‘Big Bang Betting’. Users can make one single high-sum wager and win big.

Toto also offers vetting and gambling history so that users can see each other’s reputation in other casinos. This is called a player’s ‘accident history’ and details any suspensions from other platforms. Thus, players can gamble with the peace of mind knowing that the site takes care to weed out scammers.

Advantages of Using Crypto for Gambling

There are also several benefits to using crypto in high-stakes transactions such as gambling. First of all, privacy is guaranteed which protects gamblers from fraud and unwanted attention. This is much more difficult to achieve in physical casinos. Additionally, players remain anonymous and rest assured that their data is fully protected.

The security behind crypto is also a widely known advantage to the cyber currency. Blockchain technology makes it very difficult to alter the database without a large part of the community knowing. It also makes it easy to track any changes, no matter how minimal, to their source. Encrypted transactions offer peace of mind in an industry that moves massive amounts of money daily.

Each transaction is also immediate, compared to delayed times processing winnings at regular casinos. Depositing and withdrawing from a virtual wallet is also quick and easy and mainly sidesteps the fees and verification processes charged by banks. Particularly, not dealing with any legal institutions is also a huge advantage.

Because cryptocurrency is largely decentralized, it is not subject to control by federal institutions. This means that taxes don’t apply and there are never any hidden costs apart from a standard fee which is sometimes used depending on the exchange. This means that players can withdraw their winnings hassle-free and with confidence that they’ll get exactly what they won.

When the dust from the pandemic settles, the gambling industry may see a great shift to digital games. And as more players opt for betting with crypto, confidence in the virtual currency can convince more to join. Still, digital currency remains one of the safest and most transparent options for transactions in an industry where peace of mind and reassurance means everything.",https://cryptonews.com/news/harrah-s-new-orleans-casino-requires-vaccination-card-on-lin-11693.htm,2021-09-04,Cryptonews,https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/613/3667742bdf.png,none
Ethereum records negative daily issuance for first time after EIP-1559 - The Block Crypto,"The daily issuance of the world's second largest cryptocurrency has gone negative for the first time since the Ethereum network's EIP-1559 upgrade.

The Block's Data Dashboard shows that the daily net emission of ether (ETH) on September 3 was -333, which became negative about 30 days after the EIP-1559 upgrade was activated on August 5.

The upgrade changes Ethereum's monetary policy by burning part of the transaction fees in every new block that previously belonged to Ethereum miners in an effort to alleviate the fees for network users.

Since the code activation, about 193,000 ETH have been burnt as of press time, worth more than $700 million at ETH's current price.

The Block's Dashboard further shows the amount of ETH burnt on September 3 was 13,840, surpassing the 13.507 ETH that were newly minted as block subsidies over the same period.

Since August 5, the daily issuance of ETH has been on a deflationary trend. While Ethereum's mining revenue managed to hold up in August by dollar terms, it was mainly due to ETH's price rally and the surge of on-chain activities relating to the NFT markets.

In fact, the transaction fees that Ethereum miners collected in August went down from over 90,000 ETH in July to just above 66,159 ETH while more than 170,000 ETH were burnt last month.

About 15% of the burnt ETH for August were transaction fees associated with on-chain activities on the NFT marketplace Opensea, public data shows.",https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/116659/ethereum-negative-daily-emission-eip-1559,2021-09-04,The Block Crypto,https://www.tbstat.com/wp/uploads/2021/08/Webp.net-resizeimage4.jpg,none
"In a crumbling economy, Venezuela’s cheap electricity is a blessing for its Bitcoin miners - Euronews","In the highly competitive world of crypto mining, economically-battered Venezuela has one advantage - extremely cheap electricity.

With energy prices as low as 0.06 cents per kilowatt/hour, mining cryptocurrencies is proving to be extremely lucrative for one Caracas-based entrepreneur, in a country riddled by economic uncertainty and some of the highest rates of hyperinflation in the world.

Mining firm Doctor Miner has a bank of 80 shoebox-sized computers that each cost around €340 and mine Bitcoin 24 hours a day, generating €8,500 worth of the token a month.

Company president Theodoro Toukoumidis said the firm began mining Ethereum from staff members' homes in 2016, before setting up the grid of computers that now focus on Bitcoin.

“In Venezuela, any old-gen, mid-gen or next-gen mining machine is profitable,” he told AFP.

""I sold my car to buy a computer and I literally had to walk everywhere to buy my first machine. And my partner exchanged the motorcycle he had for a computer and the two of us stayed on foot, betting absolutely everything on this technology,"" he added.

Blackouts and slow internet

While Venezuela suffers from regular power blackouts and slow internet speeds, they are not enough to disrupt a growing cryptomining industry.

Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, has been dogged by hyperinflation over several years.

The country's central bank has declared it will cut six zeros from the currency from October 1, to try and save it from sliding further against the US dollar.

Venezuela will cut six zeros from the Bolivar from October 1 to save the currency from further inflation

The bank has already cut eight zeros from the bolivar since 2008.

Having cryptocurrencies ""is a way out of hyperinflation in Venezuela for many people,"" said Venezuelan economist Aaron Olmos.

""In Venezuela the kilowatt/hour is very cheap, practically 0.06 cents. And that makes validating a blockchain or mining a cryptocurrency much more profitable for any Venezuelan than in any other country,"" he said.

In 2017, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro launched a cryptocurrency called the 'Petro' which he said would be used to get around what his government called the US's ""financial blockade"" of the country.

Despite Maduro pushing for its wider use, it has failed to win consumer or investor confidence.",https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/09/04/in-a-crumbling-economy-venezuela-s-cheap-electricity-is-a-blessing-for-its-bitcoin-miners,2021-09-04,Euronews,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/02/19/24/1000x563_cmsv2_3e7601a1-4b69-52ed-804f-305c19be9e7a-6021924.jpg,none

Start small

This is the golden rule for making any type of life investment. If you’re a beginner, start with the minimum required amount to understand how things function. You can start investing additional money to boost your earnings once you’ve earned enough confidence.

Keep Learning

Before you begin, it’s critical to understand the principles of cryptocurrency trading. Understanding how to trade in general can help you better set up the trading robot to run as effectively as possible.

Invest what you are willing to lose.

To generate more considerable returns later in your career as a trader, you will almost certainly need to make large initial deposits. You can enhance your odds of profit by investing more money, but you can also raise your chances of losing money by investing more money. Beginners must make every effort to be as safe as possible when learning the principles of trade, starting with small quantities of money and gradually increasing their investments

Use a Demo account first

Although you can start live trading right after setting up an account with a robot, we strongly advise you to first practice on a demo account. This will allow you to gain a better understanding of the platform before risking any of your money on it.

Now that CBN is Set to Launch eNaira - LEADERSHIP NEWS,"When on February 6 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) gave the directive that all deposit money banks in Nigeria should close all cryptocurrency accounts, it was received with misgiving among Nigerians.

Although the CBN through its Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, explained the fears of the apex bank, especially that Cryptocurrencies are not controlled by a singular entity, that directive did not go down well with many Nigerians who are already neck-deep in cryptocurrency trading. Of course, as usual, they continued their trading using alternative means.

With the advancement in technology, everything is now possible, including digital currency.

Several reports have shown that digital currencies are already on the way to become the perfect alternative to the traditional fiat currency.

A thought of that has forced countries to begin research into developing their own Digital currencies, to take back the flow of money into their own hands. As Cryptocurrency is totally decentralised, they want to give their citizens an alternate option that is quite similar to Cryptocurrency but will be a centralised one.

A report by Bank of International Settlements states that over 80 per cent of Central Banks are already researching into what they call Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), an electronic form of Central Bank money that citizens can use to make digital payments and store value.

A CBDC offers three main elements: A digital currency, issued by the Central Bank and Universally accessible.

As a proactive apex financial institution, the Central Bank of Nigeria is already working on its own digital currency, the eNaira.

CBN says the objective of the eNaira is to aid financial inclusion, improve payment efficiency, improve revenue and tax collection, targeted social interventions, amongst other objectives.

According to the eNaira guidelines, the first stage of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) implementation is the Monetary Authority Suite, which instruct that the CBN is the sole issuer and distributor of the eNaira – it also states that the CBN can redeem and destroy the currency.

The second stage is the Financial Institution Suite, which states the eNaira currency request or issuance of stablecoins and its management will be done by licensed financial institution.

Nigerians will be able to send and receive the digital currency at a merchant kiosk at a low-cost payment, while the digital currency will be deposited in a CBN wallet.

Commercial banks and other licensed operators are expected to provide their own wallets to serve as a vault and replace that of the CBN once they all complete the implementation.

To demonstrate its seriousness and ensure that eNaira when it is finally launched in October this year, offers Nigerians all the security it should, the apex bank has selected Bitt Inc. as its technical partner for the launch of Nigeria’s digital currency.

According to the apex bank, Bitt was selected because of its leadership position and proven technical competencies in the industry.

Of the five countries that have so far launched their own CBDC, four of them were designed and executed by Bitt Inc.

It is instructive that the CBN is very meticulous in the selection of a technical partner for the launch of eNaira. According to the bank, Bitt Inc. was chosen through a vendor selection process in line with the public procurement act conducted by seven departmental directors and a deputy governor of the CBN.

The 10 companies evaluated were said to have been graded based on technology ownership and control, implementation timeline, ease of Adoption, platform security, interoperability, and implementation experience.

“Bitt Inc. was key to the development and successful launch of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) in April 2021,” the CBN said.

Bitt Inc. was founded in 2013 by Gabriel Abed and Oliver Gale, leading minds in the blockchain industry globally. The company was set up to provide infrastructure to support a digital financial ecosystem throughout the Caribbean.

From the profile of Bitt Inc, the CBN made a good choice, picking a company that is run by thought leaders in the blockchain industry. They were also recognised by the World Bank, IMF, World Economic Forum and many other respected international organisations.

According to the World Economic Forum, Gabriel Abed, one of its early investors, is widely recognised as a leading authority on Central Bank digital currencies, math-based protocols and blockchain technology globally, and is the first entrepreneur to establish blockchain companies in the Caribbean from as early as 2010.

It is believed that the introduction of the virtual-money will revolutionise the handling of cash in the country and enhance the cashless policy of the central bank.

BTC Forecast: UK students invest more in Bitcoin nowdays - City Telegraph,"In 2021, UK students are investing in cryptocurrencies to cover their living costs. According to a survey conducted by financial education resource Save The Student, the proportion of students investing in crypto tripled during the year.

Reasons to invest in cryptocurrencies

As part of the study, 2,038 UK university students were interviewed between May and August 2021. Respondents cited mental health issues and the Covid-19 pandemic as the most likely reasons to invest in cryptocurrencies. However, 41% of those surveyed cited lack of money as a number one problem. Three-quarters of those surveyed said they had considered dropping out of school because they did not have enough money to pay for it.

“The usual sources of funding for students are becoming difficult to access due to the volatility of the job market and because some parents lost their income during the pandemic,” said Jake Butler of Save the Student.

However, regulators are warning young people about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. The UK’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) said young people invest in products for which no one is responsible. Last November the FSA banned retail investors from buying cryptocurrency derivatives.

How Much Money Do Students Need?



On average, young people face a monthly living expense of 810 pounds sterling ($ 1,120). Research has shown that the typical student is missing £ 340 per month. Possible income does not cover the average monthly cost of travel, food and accommodation.

The most likely ways to fill this gap are financial support from parents, part-time work, and savings.

Some students said they found other ways to make money, from bank overdrafts and selling real estate to gambling and participating in drug trials. Crypto investing has remained a niche with 6% of students participating. However, this figure has tripled over the past year.

It is worth noting that the attitude of the people of the United Kingdom towards cryptocurrencies has changed dramatically. They no longer see digital assets as speculation and see them as a serious investment option. While last year 38% of people compared the cryptocurrency market to gambling, that number has now dropped to 9%.

Remember that this June the company Opinium conducted a survey for the direct investment platform Interactive Investor. 1,000 British respondents aged 18 to 29 took part in this survey. 45% of young people have chosen cryptocurrencies as their first investment. Bitcoin is the undisputed leader of digital assets, a fifth of those surveyed had already invested in it.",https://citytelegraph.com/crypto/5447/btc-forecast-uk-students-invest-more-in-bitcoin-nowdays/,2021-09-04,City Telegraph,https://i2.wp.com/citytelegraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BTC-Forecast-UK-students-invest-more-in-Bitcoin-nowdays.jpg?fit=560%2C315&ssl=1,none

Trader Who Called Bitcoin Bottom Predicts This Blazing Altcoin Will Overtake Binance Coin - The Daily Hodl,"Pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader Smart Contracter says one red-hot altcoin is poised to continue its meteoric ascent and become the fourth-largest crypto asset by market cap.

Smart Contracter, who correctly predicted Bitcoin’s bottom in 2018, tells his 161,000 Twitter followers that Solana’s market capitalization is destined to exceed that of Binance Coin (BNB).

Currently, the fourth-placed Binance Coin boasts a market cap of nearly $75 billion while the seventh-placed Solana has a market cap of about $43 billion, according to CoinGecko.

“SOL flipping BNB is a matter of when, not if.”

The widely-followed trader references a tweet that he posted last month where Solana was exhibiting the “same vibes, same narrative” as Binance Coin. If Solana were to follow BNB’s trajectory, he highlighted that it would first surge to around $240 before correcting by around 40%, and then resume rallying.

To overtake Binance Coin, Solana, which is currently trading at $149.75, will need to ignite an 80% rally to $270 while BNB stays stagnant.

For now, Smart Contracter says that the “path of least resistance” for Solana is up.

“SOL easily going to $200 [in my opinion], probably higher.

This really does feel like an easy set and forget long-term play, path of least resistance is up.”

Govt. plans to introduce a bill to treat crypto as commodities - Techstory,"According to three persons familiar with the matter, the government plans to define cryptocurrencies in a new draught statute that also suggests compartmentalizing virtual currencies based on their use cases. Crypto will be treated as an asset/commodity for all purposes, including taxation, as well as payments, investment, and utility, according to the user’s needs.

This will be the first time cryptocurrencies are classified based on the technology they employ, but sources say the government’s focus will be on the asset’s end-use for regulatory purposes. The measure is also anticipated to spell out the tax treatment for such assets, ensuring that they are properly recorded in the books.

“The government is working on defining cryptocurrency and its treatment in various use cases in its draught bill so that it can be treated correctly in the books of accounts and taxed properly,” a source close to the situation said. “It has no intention of allowing virtual currency payments and settlements.”

There is no clear definition of whether crypto assets are a currency, a commodity, a service, or anything closer to equity, whether for tax or other reasons. This is a gap in the law because without a definition of an asset, the question of how it should be taxed or governed arises. According to sources close to the situation, the administration wants to define cryptocurrencies first.

“Crypto-assets can be classified according to the technology they employ or according to their intended use. So, before talking about how the legislation should function, the government needs to define what cryptocurrencies are, according to a source familiar with the situation. Crypto exchanges recently submitted policy recommendations for regulating cryptocurrencies, including classifying cryptocurrencies as digital assets and establishing a framework for registering indigenous exchanges, according to ET.

They urged that India recognize crypto tokens as digital assets rather than currency and that policies on exchange ownership, KYC, accounting, and reporting standards, among other things, be clarified. It is estimated that there are more than 5,000 cryptocurrencies, all regulated differently. In the view of Jaideep Reddy, head of technology law at Nishith Desai Associates, cryptocurrency regulation should be based on the end-use or activity of a specific token, rather than just the technology itself.

According to sources close to the situation, only cryptocurrencies that fall under the government’s definition would be allowed to trade in India. According to those familiar with the situation, these crypto assets will then be taxed appropriately. According to sources, the government could impose a security transaction tax (STT) on cryptocurrency trading as well.

Gas prices take a hit after Hurricane Ida slams offshore oil and gas hub - Detroit Free Press,"Benzinga

The S&P 500 finished out August up 2.9% for the month, its seventh consecutive month of gains. September has historically been the worst month of the year for the S&P 500, including a nearly 10% pullback in September of last year.
