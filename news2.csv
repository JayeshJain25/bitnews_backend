About Cryptocurrency:

Cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority.

Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain that serves as a public financial transaction database.

"SEC warns public vs. unregistered foreign cryptocurrency, play-to-earn entities - CNN Philippines","Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, September 13) — The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday warned the public against transacting with unregistered foreign entities and their online platforms such as cryptocurrency sites or play-to-earn games.

The commission said that these foreign corporations allow Filipinos to access their online platforms and permit the enrollment, creation, or registration of client accounts through online means despite having no license to do business in the country.

“The public is also advised to avoid transacting with corporations or entities without any registration or license to do business in the Philippines in order to avoid losing their earnings,” said SEC in an advisory. “If an entity or an activity is unlicensed or unregistered and is based abroad, you run the risk of not getting your money back once these are transmitted outside of the Philippines.""

The SEC said the unregistered online platforms include, but are not limited to:

a. Foreign Currency (Forex) Brokers and Exchanges

b. Digital Asset/Cryptocurrency/Virtual Asset Exchanges

c. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Investment Platforms

d. Yield Farming/Staking Platforms

e. Multi-asset/Multi-security Brokerage Companies

f. Websites for Securities Token Offerings/Token Generation Events

g. Illegal Investment Scheme websites

h. Binary Options Trading apps

i. Pay-to-Click/Captcha websites

j. “Play-to-Earn Gaming” platforms

k. Various fiat/cryptocurrency gambling websites

l. Various cryptocurrency-related investment websites

The SEC said it has received numerous inquiries regarding the implication of dealing with such entities.

It warned that fraud committed by any unregistered company will fall under the jurisdiction of the country where it operates.

“If you put your earnings in a platform which is reachable in the Philippines, but is operated by non-registered corporations or entities, the government can offer very limited protection or, in some cases, no protection from any harm, damage, fraud or any form of misconduct which may be caused or committed by these corporations or entities,” said SEC.

SEC advised the public to check through its website whether a company is registered or not.",http://www.cnnphilippines.com/business/2021/9/13/SEC-warns-unregistered-foreign-cryptocurrency--play-to-earn-entities--.html,2021-09-13,CNN Philippines,http://cnnphilippines.com/.imaging/mte/demo-cnn-new/750x450/dam/cnn/2021/5/21/Bitcoin-trading_CNNPH.jpg/jcr:content/Bitcoin-trading_CNNPH.jpg,none
Hedge fund Brevan Howard expands further into cryptocurrency as institutional interest jumps - CNA,"LONDON: Hedge fund Brevan Howard said on Monday (Sep 13) that it was expanding its cryptocurrency business, the latest sign that institutional interest in the asset class is gaining momentum.

Brevan, more famous for its bets on macroeconomic trends, has been among the most high-profile of major hedge funds moving into the world of cryptocurrency trading, known for its volatile markets and scope for outsize gains.

The asset manager said it would launch a new unit, BH Digital, to manage cryptocurrency and digital assets. It said it would also hire Colleen Sullivan, currently CEO of the digital arm of trading firm CMT, to lead private and venture investments in cryptocurrency.

Brevan's expansion comes on the back of other high-profile money managers venturing into this space in recent months. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones has invested in bitcoin while Man Group trades bitcoin futures.

An annual report published by PriceWaterHouseCoopers, Alternative Investment Management Association and Elwood Asset Management found total assets under management of cryptocurrency hedge funds globally nearly doubled to US$3.8 billion in 2020 from US$2 billion in the previous year.

The rise in institutional interest comes as a wider range of cryptocurrencies become available while bitcoin and ethereum, the world's best known coins, are trading well below their record highs.

""What was initially seen as something of a fad now appears to be becoming a more permanent structure of the financial landscape and this has started to see what were initially fringe financial instruments moving to become more mainstream and very much forcing the institutional interest we are now seeing,"" said Stuart Cole, head macroeconomist at London-based Equiti Capital.

The rise in institutional interest has rippled over to the trading space. Eurex, Deutsche Boerse's derivatives exchange, launched bitcoin futures on Monday to feed on the growing interest.

Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, says institutional interest in trading cryptocurrencies has soared this year.

In its second quarter letter to shareholders, Coinbase said turnover of cryptocurrencies hit a record US$462 billion in the three months to June. Of this amount, US$317 billion was traded by institutional investors and the rest by retail clients.

In the year-ago period, total turnover was US$28 billion, US$17 billion of which was institutional trading.

While hedge funds and exchanges have scrambled to capture trading revenues, global banks have been relatively slow to latch on to the trend, with their wealth management clients largely pushing them to offer cryptocurrency trading.

Citigroup is considering offering bitcoin futures trading for some institutional clients while Standard Chartered has formed a newly minted research division for cryptocurrencies.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/brevan-howard-hedge-fund-expansion-cryptocurrency-2174156,2021-09-13,CNA,https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--9xACjrku--/fl_relative%2Cg_south_east%2Cl_one-cms:core:watermark:reuters%2Cw_0.1/f_auto%2Cq_auto/c_fill%2Cg_auto%2Ch_676%2Cw_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2021-09-13t074701z_1_lynxmpeh8c08h_rtroptp_3_crypto-currency.jpg?itok=y21UVQN3,none
Cryptocurrency Difficulty: How Important Is It for Blockchain Network? - The Portugal News,"Security threats are a general concern in financial transactions. Whether you’re doing business in a bank or trading digital coins, you cannot escape the risks of falling victim to scams, hacking, and even theft. Authorities would usually warn people about these problems in hopes that they would observe precautions when making transactions involving money or some kind of asset. Crypto investors are no exception. They, too, are subject to the prevalence of cybercrimes that challenge developers to enhance the security features of the blockchain network.

By Advertiser, in Business, Finance · 13 Sep, 12:35 · 0 Comments

One way that crypto experts try to prevent malicious attacks on the crypto network is by having a more secure system. For instance, there is what they call “cryptocurrency difficulty” that makes verification of digital transactions more challenging among miners, yet it can improve the security of the network. Attackers would need enormous resources to manipulate or take control of the whole system. It ensures that all participants can mine and trade cryptos in a more secure manner.

Looking for a fast and secure online trading platform? Here’s The Bitcoin Code trading platform for beginners - the choice that might suit your financial goals.

Understanding Cryptocurrency Difficulty

Blockchain network is prone to malicious attacks. In fact, there have already been cases of hacking and theft in many digital trading platforms, which resulted in millions of assets lost. The technology that facilitates such transactions is not perfect, although the security features are being upgraded to address any loopholes. On matters involving network security, the concept of cryptocurrency difficulty is an important one.

Basically, it is a measure of how difficult a mining process is in a blockchain for a specific cryptocurrency. The higher the crypto difficulty, the greater the computing power is needed to verify transactions that enter on a blockchain. This is also being applied as a parameter to keep the average time between blocks steady as the crypto network’s hash power changes. For security concerns, the system is deemed crucial to safeguard the network against malicious attacks.

Cryptocurrency difficulty keeps the system secure and represents the computing power needed to mine a block. The network stability is also maintained in the process as the time required to find a new block is subject to it and also algorithm operations. Measuring the cryptocurrency difficulty of a new block would require an understanding of the hash power. This represents the combined computational power used in mining and processing the transactions on the blockchain.

What are Random Hashes?

A hash refers to the alphanumeric code used to represent words or data. Crypto miners would usually take a batch of data and run it through a hash algorithm which functions to create random hash codes. Before new data is added to the blockchain, miners must compete to produce a hash lower or equal to a numeric value. The basic requirement in this process is that a hash must correspond to the difficulty.

Individual miners and mining pools contribute to the computational power through mining rigs to process the data and produce the hashes. The hash power of a network represents the total hash rates of the mining rigs. However, it would take millions of hashes before the numeric value can be met and new coins are given to the successful miner, primarily because each hash is created randomly. In certain ways, the hashing process works similarly to the lottery system.

Advantages of Cryptocurrency Difficulty

The improved stability and security of the blockchain network are the major benefits of cryptocurrency difficulty. This encourages a secure and efficient flow of digital transactions. To understand how the system achieves this end, below are brief discussions on the matter:

Steady Rate of New Blocks - blockchain network needs to produce a new block at a steady average rate; thus, the software is set to automatically adjust the target hash above or below a certain level, resulting in higher or lower difficulty. One example of a pre-set crypto platform is bitcoin which adds a new block to the blockchain every 10 minutes on average.

Network Security - when there is a higher cryptocurrency difficulty, more hashes are needed to reach the target hash requirement. This process makes it very difficult and expensive for attackers to gain control of the blockchain network.

Conclusion:

The foregoing facts simply show how important and beneficial the cryptocurrency difficulty is in maintaining the integrity and stability of the blockchain network. However, as new challenges threaten the security of digital platforms, system upgrades are always necessary to keep the trust and confidence of crypto investors and traders.",https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2021-09-13/cryptocurrency-difficulty-how-important-is-it-for-blockchain-network/62330,2021-09-13,The Portugal News,https://tpn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/1224/executium-5hcV51EeeWc-unsplash.jpg,none

AMD denies loving crypto miners more than gamers - TechRadar,"Some gamers are unhappy with AMD, feeling that they are being overlooked in favor of cryptocurrency miners - and while the company denies this, it’s clear that AMD’s struggles to meet demand has caused some ill feeling.

First, let’s take a look at the background. For over a year now, GPU stock from both AMD and its rival Nvidia has been extremely limited, and it's lead to some gamers having to either pay considerably more than the recommended retail price for GPUs they actually find in stock, or put off their upgrade plans altogether.

The difficulty in getting new graphics cards is due a number of reasons that have unfortunately combined to create a perfect storm. There’s the ongoing global pandemic which seriously affected production and distribution, as well as a chip shortage which saw some chip makers struggle to meet the demands of their customers.

On top of that, there’s been a cryptocurrency boom, which has meant that miners have been snapping up any available stock. This has meant for many gamers, getting hold of a new GPU has been incredibly difficult – if not downright impossible.

AMD’s promises

As Hot Hardware reports, at a recent Deutsche Bank of 2021 Technology Conference, AMD CFO Devinder Kumar, promised that supply of GPUs will be getting better, saying that “from a supply standpoint, it's become more fortified right now,"" and that “from our standpoint, as we get to 2022 and look at all partners across the board, the supply situation continues to get better.""

So, AMD appears to be hopeful that stock issues will sort themselves out, and as with other manufacturers, it seems AMD is betting on things returning to normal in 2022. Let’s hope they are correct.

Kumar also addresses accusations that AMD is favoring cryptocurrency miners above PC gamers, saying that sales to those miners have been “negligible,” and that cryptocurrency is “not a priority for us. We do not prioritize our product or make them for the crypto folks, it is more for the gamers and that's a high priority from that standpoint.”

That’s a pretty emphatic denial, then, but will it be enough to convince people who feel they are being overlooked by AMD?

The case against AMD

So, what has led to gamers feeling neglected by AMD in favor of cryptocurrency miners? As Hot Hardware explains, there’s a few things that people have felt are evidence of this.

For a start, AMD’s biggest competitor, Nvidia, has also been struggling to meet demands. However, the company has been quite vocal about implementing artificial hash rate limiters in its recent GPUs. The aim of this is to cut the performance of the graphics cards when it comes to cryptocurrency mining, without impacting gaming performance. This, in theory, would make those GPUs less appealing to miners, and should make them more easily available to gamers.

While it’s not quite clear how successful this move has been for Nvidia just yet, what is noticeable is that AMD has not tried anything similar. While it may not be fair, if your main rival is making a big deal of addressing an issue, while you are not, then some people are going to take that lack of action as implicit support.

Why would AMD care? Well, that’s kind of the point, in a way. It doesn’t really matter who buys its products, as long as people are buying them, and as AMD’s recent financial results show, the company is doing very well. Some people may argue that AMD doesn’t want to rock the boat and do anything – such as limit the desirability of its products for a certain market – to risk its financial success.

But who is buying AMD’s GPUs? This is another element that some people think shows that AMD is at the very least more popular with miners than gamers. A recent Steam Hardware survey, which asks people using Valve’s Steam store and game launcher, what hardware they are running, showed a rather astounding trend: Nvidia’s high-end and ultra-expensive RTX 3090 outsold all of AMD’s RX 6000 GPUs combined.

This was remarkable because the RTX 3090 is a rather niche product due to its performance and price – not to mention the fact it’s hardly ever in stock. The fact more people in the Steam Hardware Survey were using this GPU compared to all of AMD’s new GPUs is quite shocking.

But, this led people to wondering if AMD’s sales are doing so well, but it seems gamers aren’t buying the GPUs, then who is? For some people, that meant cryptocurrency miners.

Finally, there have been leaks about an apparent RDNA 2-based graphics card in the works from AMD that is geared specifically for mining, with 10GB of GDDR6 memory and a 39MH/s hash rate. For people wanting to get hold of a GPU to game on, seeing AMD apparently working on a mining GPU probably would not go down well.

Does AMD love crypto miners more than gamers?

So, what’s going on? While there’s some compelling reasons for believing that AMD may be favoring cryptcurrency miners over gamers, we’re not convinced that’s the case at all.

Take the Steam Hardware Survey results, for instance. While those results won’t have been comfortable reading for AMD, suggesting that it means cryptocurrency miners are buying up all of AMD’s GPUs rather than gamers is still quite a stretch.

It’s important to note that the Steam Hardware Survey only collects information from PC gamers with Steam installed, and only from people who have agreed to take part in the survey. This means that while Steam is incredibly popular, this isn’t a terribly accurate glimpse of the hardware market.

Then there’s the rumored existence of a GPU aimed at crypto miners. Regardless of whether or not it exists, the fact is that both AMD and Nvidia have made GPUs dedicated to cryptocurrency mining in the past, and that doesn’t mean they're neglecting gamers – in fact, it’s the opposite.

By creating a crypto currency GPU, the idea is that miners will buy that instead, leaving regular GPUs to gamers, which should make it easier for them to buy, as they are not competing with miners when stock does appear.

Of all the accusations, it’s probably the fact that AMD hasn’t been seen to be doing as much as Nvidia to curtail crypto miners buying up its GPUs that has the most weight, and it’s something we’d like to see the company do more of.

In the end, though, Kumar’s explanation of AMD’s position on crypto mining (that it’s not its priority) is pretty compelling. AMD is a huge company, and it’s been seeing success not just with PC gamers, but on the server and professional side of things as well. The amount of money it makes there would dwarf any revenue it makes from crypto currency sales which, after all, is still a relatively niche endeavour, so it wouldn’t make sense for AMD to prioritise it over customers that make it a lot more money – and which have been so instrumental in its success in the past.

We contacted AMD for comment and were told that it had nothing more to add to Kumar’s statements, and that’s absolutely fair enough. It can sometimes be tempting to look for conspiracy theories, especially if you’re frustrated with a company, but more often than not, the most simple (or obvious) explanation is the right one.",https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-denies-loving-crypto-miners-more-than-gamers,2021-09-13,TechRadar,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y5BaBkp9uJ2RQnJbCbDEsA-1200-80.jpg,none

ETH/USD: Ethereum Drifts Lower After Testing Highs Last Week - DailyForex.com,"As of this writing, ETH/USD is trading slightly below the 3300.00 level which may be viewed as a rather nervous intersection for the cryptocurrency near term.

After traversing near the 4000.00 mark only ten days ago and causing speculators to think about the value summit climbed in May, ETH/USD has demonstrated an ability to drift lower in value. The rather swift fall in prices should not come as a major surprise to speculators. Even if a trader has visions of glorious new heights via Ethereum, if they are a student of the cryptocurrency market they must acknowledge that rather wild reversals downward that are a frequent part of the landscape.

Technically, ETH/USD has enjoyed a very solid bullish run since the third week in July, after the broad cryptocurrency market began to dust off the pain from a rather steep decline in values which was exhibited from the middle of May until about the 20th of July. In the past ten days of trading, ETH/USD has managed to see a high of nearly 4025.00 on the 3rd of September, and a low of almost 3010.00 on the 7th of September.

While ETH/USD is certainly trading above the lows seen nearly a week ago, that lower depth was hit with what can be described as a flash crash. Technically, the ability to trade above this mark is not that impressive, and in fact may be a troubling warning regarding the support levels bearish speculators may try to target if they believe further weakness in ETH/USD will become pronounced.

ETH/USD is in a rather intriguing and perhaps dangerous trading landscape as this week gets started. Technically, ETH/USD ‘needs’ to be able to penetrate the 3300.00 juncture and sustain values above to help motivate buyers who believe a reversal higher will pick up momentum and the bullish trend seen since late July will be reignited.

However, if ETH/USD is not able to sustain its current price and begins to challenge support near the 3250.00 ratio and then sinks towards the 3215.00 mark, sellers may become convinced that now is the right time to target lower junctures. Short-term traders need to use their risk-taking tactics wisely. Sentiment within the broad cryptocurrency is showing signs of nervousness as speculators wonder if the downturn in evidence the past week will continue. Traders who believe that technically ETH/USD will have additional room to move downward, may want to be sellers around the 3290.00 to 3275.00 levels and place take profits near current support.

Current Resistance: 3353.00

Current Support: 3215.00

Central Bank of Colombia Says Cryptocurrencies Must Be Regulated By DailyCoin - Investing.com,"Central Bank of Colombia Says Cryptocurrencies Must Be Regulated

The manager of the Banco de la República, Leonardo Villar, believes that cryptocurrencies are high-risk assets and should therefore be regulated.

It is estimated that the use of in Colombia represents around 2% of GDP.

One of the official’s fears is the use of digital assets by the country’s criminal organizations.

The manager of the Banco de la República (Central Bank of Colombia), Leonardo Villar, believes that despite the implicit risks in cryptocurrencies due to their high degree of volatility and lack of support, their acceptance and regulation represents an important step.

The senior official of the Colombian issuing institute presented part of his thoughts on the future of cryptocurrencies in the South American country during his participation in the Congress on Comprehensive Risk Management, organized by businessmen and insurance executives.

Villar said, “cryptocurrencies are mechanisms that have elements that could be interesting for the future, but which must first be regulated.” Although he did not say so explicitly, his words revealed that crypto assets will be part of the Colombian financial system sooner rather than later.

Growing Use of Cryptocurrencies Encourages Regulations

“Colombia appears with a relatively high use of cryptocurrencies, which could be linked to the fact that it is a good way to handle illegal activities. That forces us to have this type of activity highly regulated and to be very careful with the way it is carried out,” he said.

Villar’s words only confirm that the cryptocurrency regulation process in Colombia is advancing by leaps and bounds. Although the use of digital assets in the country is not regulated, it has not been declared illegal by the government either.

Colombia is among the Latin American countries where the use and adoption of digital money has increased the most in the last year, along with others such as Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Chile, according to the Statista Global Consumer Survey.

Transactions in Bitcoin alone last year reached 147 million dollars in Colombia. This places Colombia among the Latin America nations and the world where this cryptocurrency is most traded.

According to the former director of National Planning, Simón Gaviria Muñoz, quoting data from Citi Research, “Bitcoin currencies in Colombia reach almost 2% of GDP.” The analyst also considers that “the issuance of a cryptocurrency by Banco de la República is not only convenient, it is the future.”

On The Flipside

The issuing bank manager’s warning about the use of crypto assets is undoubtedly linked to money laundering by organized crime.

Colombia is the world’s leading producer and exporter of cocaine with an estimated production that reached 1,228 metric tons in 2020, according to figures from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

For Leonardo Villar, the use and regulation of cryptocurrencies in the country “is a great challenge between the financial sector and the Banco de la República.”

The official pointed out that

""the process of digitizing financial operations is an accelerated process and it is necessary to seek a balance between the initiative and the technological capacity of the sector and the capacities including the Banco de la República to generate infrastructure that connects everyone."" Finally, the manager of the Banco de la República said that

""cryptocurrencies are mechanisms that generate very high risks, whose support is not fully known."" He stressed that

""many people get into cryptocurrencies for one or two reasons: because they simply want to speculate in a big way or because paradoxically it is an alternative to achieve transactions that do not leave traces, that can be terribly dangerous.""

Why You Should Care?

There are two aspects that are motivating the regulation of cryptocurrencies in Colombia. One is the growing use among consumers for buying and selling transactions. The other is its use by drug cartels. Both concerns will only speed up the regulatory process through the discussion of bills that have already been submitted.

Zimbabwean minister pushes crypto solutions - CoinJournal,"The finance minister of Zimbabwe discussed at length the benefits of cryptocurrencies in the payment's sector

Mthuli Ncube, Zimbabwe's Finance Minister, advocated for crypto following a visit to the DMCC Crypto Centre in Dubai. He acknowledged the usability that crypto presented, noting that crypto-based solutions would go a long way in lowering the costs incurred in facilitating remittances from abroad.

""I visited the DMCC CRYPTO CENTRE in Dubai, which is a fascinating incubation hub for cryptocurrency and payment solutions. Came across solutions that could lower charges for diaspora remittances,"" the Zimbabwean minister tweeted.

Many might have only seen the benefits Zimbabwe would gain from the uptake of crypto, but some users on social media asked for caution. One user claimed that banks in the country were notorious manipulators of the forex market and that taking up crypto might cause a crash of the Zimbabwean dollar.

""When banks stop manipulating the forex exchange rate then maybe then RBZ can consider cryptocurrency. Otherwise it will lead to massive crash of the ZWL.""

It also did not seem like Minister Ncube really had the feel of what was happening on the ground in Zimbabwe. Members of the crypto community quickly pointed out that there already were crypto startups to achieve the crypto solutions he was advocating for. The CEO of Flexfintx, Victor Mapunga, pointed out the existence of said startups to the minister.

""We already have blockchain & crypto companies in Zim such as @Flex_Tx, work with local players.""

A report by Techzim also appeared to suggest that the minister was uninformed on crypto matters in Zimbabwe. The report questioned the need to seek solutions in the United Arab Emirates while the country already had startups such as Zimbo Cash, Uhuru Wallet and Dystater that offered the faster, cost-reduced crypto solutions to simplify the cross-border transfer of finances.

Around the time of his appointment back in 2018, Ncube became an outspoken proponent of crypto. He pushed for the use of these digital assets to aid Zimbabwe's failing financial system. At the time, the finance minister had proposed that Zimbabwe needed to follow the route of Switzerland in adopting crypto solutions.

Noting the importance that innovation held, he stated that more often than not, central banks remained behind in exploring such technologies. He promised to drive the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe into establishing a crypto division intended to invest in and understand Bitcoin. This, he explained, would help the top banks in the country to understand digital assets.

The adoption of crypto would potentially go a long way in advancing the stability of Zimbabwe's economy. Crypto's store of value would arguably beat the extreme levels of inflation and economic turmoil in the country.",https://coinjournal.net/news/zimbabwes-finance-minister-pushes-for-crypto-solutions/,2021-09-13,CoinJournal,https://coinjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631531181280-9311da11-9ff6-45ab-9208-dd1017e5299a.png,none

Altbase To List NanoDogeCoin - Benzinga - Benzinga,"It has been announced that NanoDogeCoin has been listed on the Altbase mobile app, allowing users to buy and sell $INDC on both iOS and Android.

A Listing with a Difference

The listing on the app is designed to give users an easy place to purchase NanoDogeCoin, with also the view of picking up new investors through the Altbase platform itself as well as targeted marketing strategies.

The app listing is a further commitment to the future of NanoDogeCoin from the community team, adding the ability to purchase through credit/debit card in fiat – to make $NDC more accessible to users new and old via the App/Play Store.

$NDC joins a growing list of cryptos on the platform, with the app recently increasing its user base by 340%. The listing on Altbase is an organic strategy designed to make the token more accessible, and thus increase volume over time. The $NDC and Altbase teams have been working together in order to provide NanoDogeCoin more exposure, and accessibility for its user base.

Community Driven Changes

Due to hardcoded limitations and restrictions within the current contract, the developers with the backing of the community have decided to switch things up and make the necessary changes now, in order to take this project to the next level. Despite NanoDogeCoin providing passive income from crypto – the current LP prevents the token from further growth, hence the migration to alleviate this issue.

By migrating to the new smart contract, the goal is to lower overall liquidity, to appeal to new investors and drive momentum within the project, towards an increased market cap. The migration and Altbase listing are just the start of the community teams’ plans for growth.

The migration and the Altbase listing, is further to the news of the recent crypto staking dashboard launch, allowing users to stake $NDC and earn a variety of rewards in different cryptos.

Altbase and NanoDogeCoin

For projects specifically, Altbase takes a different approach to listings and aims to use proven and effective click-funnels to drive traffic to the project's own sites, not to exchanges. The aim is to bring new traffic to NanoDogeCoin through search engines, and then provide these new users a place to transact – i.e Altbase.

We have chosen to list on Altbase as we are invested in the strategy outlined by the guys there. Bringing traffic to us and our proposition, and then giving a place for users to buy the token easily. Wilburt Slaylor – CEO

The migration to the new smart contract will enable positive developments, whilst giving the project more options for mainstream adoption, and rewards for investors in passive income. The Altbase listing is just the start for NanoDogeCoin in terms of furthering accessibility and reach of the token.

"Annahar’s Twitter Was Hacked, Renamed To ‘Elon Musk’ & Began Promoting A Bitcoin Scam - The961","The Twitter account of the Lebanese Annahar newspaper was recently hacked and used for cryptocurrency scams.

It became clear that something was wrong with Annahar’s Twitter account when its name was abruptly changed to “Elon Musk” and its famous logo was replaced by a photo of a SpaceX rocket — the same one that is currently Elon Musk’s Twitter profile photo.

For some context, Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, is known for his somewhat erratic promotion of cryptocurrency on many occasions, especially the meme-born dogecoin.

This has given rise to a new market of online scams that use Elon Musk’s credentials and profile photos on social media to trick unsuspecting users into losing their bitcoin and other currencies.

Though the majority of those scammers are amateur online identity thieves, some take it a step further by hacking verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers and transforming them into fake Elon Musk accounts, in an attempt at boosting their credibility.

This is exactly what happened in the case of Annahar, whose Twitter account was briefly used by hackers to promote scams in threads of Elon Musk’s tweets before being finally recovered.

Though its name has been fixed and the scam tweets deleted, the account remains without a profile photo, as of the time of writing.",https://www.the961.com/annahar-twitter-hacked-elon-musk-scam/,2021-09-13,The961,https://www.the961.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Annahars-Twitter-Was-Hacked-Renamed-To-Elon-Musk-amp-Began-Promoting-A-Bitcoin-Scam-1.jpg,none
The Morning After: Epic has already appealed Apple App Store lawsuit ruling - Engadget,"The weekend before Apple’s big iPhone event, the company’s legal battle with Epic and app developers cast a shadow. It’s hard to describe either side as an out-and-out loser or winner; Apple must allow App Store developers to direct users to other payment systems, which would let them bypass the 30 percent cut of in-app payments that Apple takes. Judge Gonzales Rogers also ruled, however, that the App Store doesn't violate antitrust law. She ruled against Epic in Apple's counterclaim for breach of contract. Epic has to pay Apple $3.65 million.

The latest development: Epic has already filed an appeal against that ruling. The initial notice didn't explain exactly how the Fortnite developer was challenging the decision.

I’m sure Apple would love to put the legal tussle behind it — while the ruling will cut into its revenue from some developers, it shouldn’t hugely affect its bottom line — and it’s got more new phones and devices to reveal. Want to know what we’re expecting from the big event? Read everything we know so far, right here!

-Mat Smith

You may have a lower-priced AirPods option, too.

Engadget

Having said that, this little nugget was too late for our What to Expect story on Apple’s incoming phones. It seems the iPhone 13 — will the company call it that? — comes with some 1TB options, regardless of the expansion of iCloud and storage outside of the device itself. Well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max will have up to 1TB of storage alongside 128GB, 256GB and 512GB options carried over from the iPhone 12 Pro family. That could prove a little more expensive. Perhaps more importantly, he also believed the base iPhone 13 and 13 mini would start at 128GB versus the (frankly inadequate) 64GB of their predecessors.

He added that the current second-gen AirPods will stick around and sell alongside a new third-generation model, to be revealed at Apple's September 14th event, probably with a price drop.

Don’t sleep on the iPhone mini

It was the most exciting iPhone 12.

Mat Smith (yes, me) loves the iPhone 12 mini. While the battery life was frustrating, that there’s a tiny smartphone, powerful enough for gaming and other processor-intensive tasks, is a very good thing. We hope — and rumors suggest that — Apple will continue the iPhone mini family.

Interesting early results.

NASA

The Perseverance rover's first rock samples from Mars are already providing insights. NASA researchers' early analysis of the samples indicates water was present in Jezero Crater for a ""long time"" — think tens of thousands or millions of years. That, in turn, suggests Mars' water was stable enough to make it relatively welcoming to microscopic life. The mission team also detected crucial salts that might have formed when water flowed through the sampled rock. The salt might have not only trapped pockets of Mars' old water, but could have preserved signs of life.

Regulators are worried stablecoins hurt stability more than they help.

Stablecoins are ostensibly safer than regular cryptocurrency thanks to their ties to less volatile assets, but US regulators apparently aren't convinced. Bloomberg sources hear the Treasury Department and other federal agencies are close to a possible crackdown on stablecoins through a review from the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Officials are reportedly concerned the digital money is largely unregulated and could ultimately destabilize the financial system, not protect it.

Some of that concern centers around Tether, which tries to stabilize its funds by holding large amounts of corporate debt. That could be vulnerable to ""chaotic investor runs"" if cryptocurrency values tank, according to Bloomberg.

Cathie Wood's Ark Grants Itself Power to Buy Canada Bitcoin ETFs - Investing.com India,"(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is allowing one of its funds to invest in Canadian ETFs as the money manager seeks fresh ways to bet on digital assets.

In a late-Friday filing for the $5.7 billion ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE: )), the firm tweaked the fund’s prospectus to include reference to holding exposure to cryptocurrencies via “exchange-traded funds domiciled in Canada.”

The move comes after the $1.3 billion Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), a blockchain-focused product, was last week shown to have a tiny stake in three Canadian Bitcoin ETFs.

Investors and issuers in the $6.8 trillion U.S. ETF market are still waiting for regulators to approve exchange-traded products investing in cryptocurrency. While Canada and Europe have raced ahead, a huge backlog of applications has built up with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ark is among those in line, having teamed up with Switzerland-based 21Shares AG to file plans for a fund in the U.S.

ARKW already boasts some Bitcoin exposure -- about 5.5% of the fund is invested in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The $30 billion vehicle is arguably one of the easiest ways for investors to access cryptocurrencies in the U.S. via a fund, but its structure makes it inefficient and its value frequently detaches from that of the Bitcoin it holds.

As of Friday, GBTC was down about 20% since the first Canadian Bitcoin ETF launched in February. That fund, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC) has dropped 9%. ARKW has lost about 6.5% since then, but is still up 2.3% year-to-date. It has lured about $691 million in new cash in 2021.

A spokesperson for Ark didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the documentation changes.

"Polkadot (DOT) the Only Bullish Crypto, Despite the Retreat in the Market - FX Leaders","In the last two months since the bullish reversal in the crypto market, different cryptocurrencies have taken the lead in pushing the bullish trend higher. Axie Infinity AXS coin was the first to signal the bullish reversal in July, then Solana and Fantom coins turned the market’s favourite, now Polkadot has taken the lead in the market.

The developments in the Polkadot network have been fuelling this bullish momentum in DOT coin and it seems like the bullish momentum will continue for this cryptocurrency. There have been a few updates in this network recently which are positive for Polkadot and will continue to fuel this uptrend. PolkaBridge’s multi-chain automated market maker has been running on the ETHEREUM network, but it is going to be transferred to the Polkadot network soon entirely.

DOT/USD

Besides that, the 6th Parachain auction ended last Wednesday. The Kilt model won the slot, which means that a new type of business model will take place in verifying transactions. Moonbeam which is another parachain in Polkadot will be integrating with Lido to offer liquid staking on Kusama and the Polkadot ecosystem.

So, the developments have been supporting Polkadot and buyers remain in control, while the rest of the market has been retreating lower recently. On the H4 chart above, we see that smaller moving averages like the 50 SMA (yellow) and the 100 SMA (green) were pushing the price higher, but the 200 SMA (purple) came into play after the flash crash in the market last Tuesday. The price bounced off that moving average and remains bullish, despite the minor pullback today.

Polkadot Analysis – DOT/USD Daily Chart

Polkadot Bounced off the 50 daily SMA

On the daily chart, we see that the 50 SMA (yellow) held the price during that crash and DOT/USD bounced off that moving average. Polkadot made new highs after that which shows that buyers are in control again and this latest pullback should be a good opportunity to buy Polkadot. Although, I would have liked to buy Polkadot at the 200 SMA (purple) so we’re following the price action.",https://www.fxleaders.com/news/2021/09/13/polkadot-dot-the-only-bullish-crypto-despite-the-retreat-in-the-market/,2021-09-13,FX Leaders,https://fxlmwpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/13114347/dot-h4.png,none
This Jindal Stock has Gained 1327% in One Year Despite Consistently Making Losses - Investing.com India,"By Aditya Raghunath

Investing.com -- The phenomenon of investors going crazy behind loss-making companies is generally restricted to the start-up world and new-age companies. It rarely occurs in listed companies and is even more rare in traditional businesses like rail freight wagons and infrastructure.

However, there is one company where this phenomenon has been playing out since last year. JITF Infralogistics Ltd (NS: ) is a player in the rail freight wagon, water and urban infrastructure space. The stock has been hitting the upper circuit in 37 out of the last 38 sessions, including today. The data for the stock blows one’s mind.

In the last one month, it has moved up 139%. In the last six months, it has gained 1,120% and in 2021, it is up 720%. Over the last one year, it has gained 1,327%. An amount of Rs 10,000 invested on September 14 last year would be Rs 1,42,721 today.

And the company hasn’t turned in any decent performance during this time period. For the April-June 2021 quarter, it posted a loss of Rs 41 crore on revenues of Rs 206 crore. It didn’t do any better in the April-June 2020 quarter. It posted a loss of Rs 43 crore on revenues of Rs 81 crore. For FY21, it posted a total loss of Rs 51 crore.

None of the numbers above justify the increase in its stock price.",https://in.investing.com/news/this-jindal-stock-has-gained-1327-in-one-year-despite-consistently-making-losses-2880722,2021-09-13,Investing.com India,https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/a20a8d2a75f456106a2edd5af310b7ee_w_800_h_450.jpg,none
How to Mine the Best Cryptocurrency with FixStake - Inside Bitcoins,"The fact is, the world of cryptocurrency has taken over every aspect of our global economy, yet while an undeniable buzzword and regular topic of discussion for investors and amateurs alike, there is still a lot of confusion about this powerful financial instrument. At the end of the day, people want a clear answer to one major question: How do you earn cryptocurrency – and what is the best way to do so? The answer to this question is clear: Crypto mining.

Few could argue with the longstanding efficacy of crypto mining. Since the early days of cryptocurrency, this method has maintained a hold on the digital marketplace. Nowadays, however, the viability of the average human tapping into its potential is slim to none. Crypto mining, unfortunately, requires expensive equipment, extensive knowledge, and an exponential amount of power – all things that the average investor is less likely to have access to.

And thus, cloud mining usurped the competition, offering every day investors an opportunity to tap into the power of crypto mining without any understanding of its mechanics. What does this mean? It means customers can now mine cryptocurrency from the comfort of their homes. The only requirements? A single contract and a company to manage the operation.

If you’re fixing to partner with one such corporation, search no further than FixStake.

What is FixStake?

FixStake makes crypto mining simple. This crypto mining powerhouse continues to lead the charge in accruing Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. It fuels the computers so you can fill your bank accounts.

With FixStake’s help, newly interested and eternally-intrigued crypto-enthusiasts can profit without a problem.

How to Sign Up for FixStake

Crypto mining consists of two steps: Plan and Profit.

Cloud mining requires a contract. This ensures that the miners – and their investors – receive a worthwhile return on their endeavors. However, composing a contract requires considerable effort. That is where FixStake comes in.

FixStake provides its customers with a plethora of contract options. No matter your income, you can become an investor today. Backers on a budget can start for as little as $1, while experienced investors can fund $10,000 projects. All you have to do is select the best plan to bankroll.

Once you click the “Start Now” button at the bottom of your desired contract, all that remains is to enter your personal information: your full name, email address, phone number, and country of residence. A FixStake team member will reach out shortly thereafter to complete the account creation and coordinate the contract payment.

Now comes phase two: Profit.

Making Money on FixStake

With your investment secured, the only obstacle left is time. Each customer receives a portion of their promised return each day until the contract expires.

This can be transferred to your personal bank accounts or converted further to continue future investments. The power lies in your hands.

With mining made easy, what else are you waiting for? Time to sign up on FixStake and get your fix of cryptocurrency.",https://insidebitcoins.com/news/how-to-mine-the-best-cryptocurrency-with-fixstake,2021-09-13,Inside Bitcoins,https://insidebitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fixstake.jpg,none

The Indian government is looking to tax cryptocurrency trades and their ecosystem in the country, a financial news media outlet, ET Now, reported on Monday citing unnamed sources.The tax department is in favour of taxing crypto exchanges and trades and the government feels that any activity that generates income must pay tax, according to ET Now.Last week, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had raised “major concerns” about cryptocurrencies.On 31 May this year, the Reserve Bank of India advised that banks as well as other regulated entities may continue to carry out customer due diligence processes in line with all the regulations that are being implemented on any other financial services in the country. This suggests that any investors who are receiving income from their crypto-currency transactions (from India or overseas) will have to pay tax under the current tax laws. In April 2018, the RBI banned banks from supporting crypto transactions after cases of fraud involving virtual currencies were reported. However, the Supreme Court of India struck down the ban in March 2020. Among the reasons cited was that cryptocurrencies were not illegal albeit unregulated in India.The RBI, however, has not yet granted legal tender status to Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.Despite repeated concerns by the RBI regarding cryptocurrencies, trading in the assets surged to $6.6 billion in May, compared with $923 million in April 2020, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform which provides data, software, services, and research to government agencies, exchanges, financial institutions, and insurance and cybersecurity companies in over 60 countries.

Bitcoin ($BTC) Network Set to Consume as much Energy as Pakistan in 2021: Bloomberg - Coingape,"Bitcoin ($BTC) price continued to slump further in the second week of September and currently trading under $45K.

The top cryptocurrency’s bullish run in August is facing a big hurdle in September, but what could cause more trouble for the top cryptocurrency is the recent energy consumption report of the network. A recent report from Bloomberg highlighted that BTC has surpassed the energy consumption levels of 2020 by the third quarter of 2021 itself.

The 2020 Bitcoin network consumption was estimated to be about 67TWh of electricity, while it has already consumed more than that in 2021, the top cryptocurrency is estimated to consume more than 91TWh, which is equivalent to the energy consumed by Pakistan.

The report highlighted that the use of less efficient mining machines due to an increased price of BTC has been a great cause for driving up the energy consumption of the BTC network.

The above chart shows a significant spike in the Bitcoin Energy consumption in 2021, which could be attributed to the bull run and an increased trader activity because of that. However, it is also important to note that the energy supply on the BTC network fell drastically during the Chinese crackdown and currently getting back to the pre-crackdown levels.

Another Bitcoin Energy FUD on the Cards?

The Bloomberg report might trigger another Bitcoin Energy FUD that hit its peak in May this year. The top cryptocurrency’s energy consumption has been a topic of debate for years now, but what makes it murkier is the half-truths and presenting only one aspect of the story. While there is no denying that the Bitcoin network consumes comparatively much more energy but that energy is in turn used to make the network decentralized and secure.

When compared to mainstream financial services, the carbon footprint, and the energy consumption is very low. While major companies have started to venture into clean and green BTC mining in 2021, the impact of the same could be visible in the coming years.
