"Cryptocurrency Prices in India Today: Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum Witness Slight Slip | Technology News - Gadgets 360","Crypto prices have slipped a little over the weekend, with Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Ether all down. An announcement that Walmart would be accepting Litecoin, which turned out to be fake, created a lot of confusion, and hurt the prices of different coins. Bitcoin prices still held above $45,000 at the time of writing, and more experts are predicting a big upswing for it over the remaining months of 2021. If that happens, the rest of the market will likely be buoyed along as well, as we saw at the start of the year.

The value of Bitcoin on Monday slipped by 3.35 percent in India. The crypto currency is trading at Rs. 36,44,325. Previously, the currency had closed trading at Rs. 37,70,785 indicating that in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has shrunken substantially with a fresh value difference of over Rs. 1 lakh, as per the Gadgets 360 Bitcoin Price History tracker.

Ethereum, that is currently valued at Rs. 2,56,011, has also witnessed a slip of 4.82 percent. The crypto currency had closed at Rs 2,68,975 – and has gone down in value by over Rs. 12,000.

And Dogecoin, that was riding on the value of Rs. 20 last week, has again slipped down significantly by 5.76 percent. The Elon Musk-supported crypto currency is priced at Rs 17.86 in India as we write this.

On the other hand, crypto currencies like Tether and USD Coin have gained value by 1 percent each and are trading at Rs. 79.89 each as well.

Cryptocurrency trading and transactions are picking momentum around the world, despite anti-crypto voices questioning the legibility of these digital currencies. Last week, the President of the European Central bank, Christine Lagarde had said that she does not consider cryptocurrencies as real.

"All you need to know about the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin - Newsroompost","New Delhi: Bitcoin, one of the trendiest words in the world of finance which has gained popularity over time. This is the first most popular crypto followed by Ethereum.

Notably, since then, there has been a sharp spike in cryptocurrencies, so much that Bitcoin even touched the $65,000 mark.

However, there has been a parallel debate between the bull and bears of Bitcoin. According to the experts, Bitcoin bull predicts that it can become an acceptable asset while bears remind how vulnerable and volatile it has been in the past.

In 2018 and parts of 2019, bitcoin suffered a blow however, it was able to bounce back strongly in 2020. Since mid-March last year, Bitcoin has gained $60,000 in both February and March 2021. According to data revealed by Statista, the main reason behind this is the involvement of Tesla, which announced that $1.5 billion worth of digital coins and the IPO of the US’ biggest crypto exchange were acquired.

There has been much confusion regarding the trading of cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoins. Here is all you need to know:

What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a virtual currency and is online cash that can be transacted over the web. A lot of services have evolved that had made crypto easily available to users. Besides, corporates are strategising payment systems associated with cryptocurrency.

In 2008, a paper named ‘Bitcoin-A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System,’ was posted to a mailing list discussion on cryptocurrency by Satoshi Nakamoto. Soon after the price of one bitcoin reached $1000, the value of the coin fell to $12 in the year 2013.

Platform to buy Bitcoins?

People who wish to buy Bitcoins can opt for Bitcoin exchanges. There are platforms named Coinbase and Coindesk where one can easily exchange cryptocurrencies. In India, Bitcoins can be bought from ZebPay. For this, one needs to do a transfer from a bank account to ZebPay. Procedures are simple including a basic KYC for which one needs to submit Aadhaar Card, Pan Card, or any other identification document.

How does it work?

Transfer of Bitcoin happens over the web. It happens from one person’s virtual wallet to another person’s virtual wallet only if that person is a party to that transaction. The exchange of Bitcoin is recorded in a public list called blockchain, however, the names of the people involved in the transaction are not revealed.

Bitcoins In India:

The transaction of Bitcoins is legal in India after the law was passed by the Supreme Court. Initially, a ban was announced upon Bitcoin transactions in India in 2017 by the Reserve Bank of India. However, with the apex court’s decision, people and companies can exchange bitcoins easily and without fear. However, there are no rules and regulations for resolving issues related to Bitcoins.

"How to pick the right cryptocurrency investment as trading breaks into the mainstream, according to Unicorn Venture Capital’s Eunice Wong - Business Insider Australia","This article is sponsored by Zipmex.

For those comfortable with its volatility, cryptocurrency is an exciting new frontier with a myriad of opportunities. We are living in a phase of transition, which could be viewed as akin to the early days of email — an exciting new technology that scared some and excited others.

Some took to electronic mail like ducks to water, excited by its possibilities. Others, on the other hand, weren’t so enthusiastic. Eventually, though, whether any individual liked it or not, society as a collective, made the transition from a largely paper mail-based system to an electronic one. Of course, many of us still receive letters every day — mostly from banks, energy companies, and the like — but when’s the last time you posted one?

Some believe traditional forms of currency are like paper mail, with crypto like Bitcoin representing the exciting new wave of the future. Slowly, yet steadily, the barriers to using crypto as your main form of currency are falling. Trading crypto has never been easier thanks to crypto trading apps such as Zipmex, which allows users to trade digital currencies instantly. More stores are beginning to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, and more people are becoming comfortable with its validity.

Eunice Wong, director of Unicorn Venture Capital, is a pioneer in the sense that she is one of the many players banking on this crypto-led revolution. She’s also something of a finance influencer, or ‘finfluencer’ — with a healthy 119,000 followers on Instagram and 20,000 on Twitter, where she posts about cryptocurrency multiple times daily. We caught up with her to discuss trading, strategy, and all things crypto.

Hi Eunice, please tell us a little bit about who you are and what you do.

I am a momentum trader, I trade simple high probability patterns in the direction of the long term trend. I simply follow the money flow. Essentially, let the big boys place their bets and I react.

90% of the time, I wait for the range to contract on falling volume, once I think there’s minimal downside risk, I buy the first price/volume breakouts out of the base and run a stop-loss below support.

How does cryptocurrency fit into your life?

Cryptocurrency is still in the early stages of adaptation. As it stands now, there are not as many mainstream retailers that accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment. But now, it can be seen in the adaptation of cryptocurrency through payment portals such as PayPal, Visa and Square. We are on a verge of seeing a generational shift into the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency.

How did you get started with it?

I was taught to momentum trade equity markets by following the money flow. I was attracted to the volatility in the crypto space when I realised the same strategy I implemented in equity also worked in the crypto space. So I went ahead and opened a crypto account and started trading.

Has crypto changed how you approach money?

No. In my view, crypto is another form of money.

Do you use crypto for purchases or purely investment?

At this stage, it is purely investment due to the limited availability of being able to purchase products using crypto.

How do you pick a good investment?

I mainly trade the majority of the coins due to the volatility and quick returns in the space. When it comes to longer-term investments, tokens in blockchain and utility space are my picks as they offer intrinsic value and function that are solving problems in the ecosystem.

A lot of crypto beginners can find the tax liabilities of investment quite tricky; did you have the same experience?

I can’t answer that just yet as I started trading crypto in January this year. My advice to people about taxation is to pay for a good accountant who knows what they’re doing.

Do you have any tips for people looking to get into crypto?

Pick a reputable exchange to get started with, learn from people with a prolonged and strong track record in trading and investing. Start off small until you have a more in-depth understanding of the space.

Cryptocurrency Hyper Fund under govt scanner - Sify News,"Sources said Hyper Fund, a DEFI by Hyper Tech Group has come under the radar recently. The Group claims to have launched the Hyper Fund to provide a decentralized financial infrastructure. Hyper Fund was announced in mid-2020.

New Delhi: The government is keeping a close eye on cryptocurrency floating in the market based out of the country folowing alert that agencies responsible to check financial fraud are watching a company called Hyper Fund.

As per the company website it is led by Ryan Xu, however, with the Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) model Hyper Fund has been luring investors with higher returns and such offerings, a common practice under Ponzi Schemes, that got the authorities alerted in the first place.

According to sources, complaints against such Funds have started pouring in several states. In India, the RBI, Union Finance Ministry and SEBI had warned people against cryptocurrency trading. The RBI is planning to launch India's official digital currency- E Rupee soon.

The Finance Ministry has clarified that Virtual currencies are also not legal tender. Hence, VCs are not currencies. The RBI has also clarified that it has not given any licence/ authorization to any entity/ company to operate or deal with Bitcoin or any virtual currency.

In June 2018, Amit Bhardwaj was arrested at the Delhi Airport by Pune police along with his brother Vivek Bhardwaj in connection with an alleged Ponzi scheme. Bhardwaj, started his own bitcoin mining operations and allegedly cheated more than 8,000 people to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore from across the country.

He has lodged a complaint with the Delhi Police special cell, alleging that he received an extortion call and was asked to pay protection money on September 6, 2021. He had setup multi-level marketing (MLM) scam by luring investors to give him Bitcoins in return for promised higher returns, police had alleged.

Regulators in UK have issued warning against such fund and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have warnings issued for both Hyper Fund and Fund Advisor.

On its website, which was first published on in March 23 ,2021 and later updated on August 31, the FCA said, ""We believe this firm may be providing financial services or products in the UK without our authorisation. Almost all firms and individuals offering, promoting or selling financial services or products in the UK have to be authorised or registered by us. This firm is not authorised by us and is targeting people in the UK.""

Warning investors about such fund, it further said: ""You will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or be protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), so you are unlikely to get your money back if things go wrong.""

The Website used by these companies as per FCA ar http://thehyperfund.online, https://thehyperfund.com/

Decentralised Finance (DEFI) offering through blockchain technology by HyperTech Group, which is said to be based out from Hong Kong, as sources said Indian Regulators and Authorities have started monitoring the situation.

Following the measures taken by financial regulators such as the US Security and Exchange Commission and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, Indian regulators and enforcement authorities have started monitoring investment in Hyper Fund -- a Decentralised Finance offering through blockchain technology by HyperTech Group.

Globally, Financial regulators acknowledge the fact that Ponzi scheme organizers often use the latest innovation, technology, product or growth industry to entice investors and give their scheme the promise of high returns. Potential investors are often less skeptical of an investment opportunity when assessing something novel, new or ""cutting-edge.""

Corsair DeFi Becomes the Most Talked About Project of September - newsbtc.com,"The CASH token is an instrument of influence on the global cryptocurrency market, created by a group of anonymous traders from the Euronext exchange – Corsair DeFi. With this token, anyone can resist market makers and constantly earn money on the growth of the token and on the services of seizing and farming of the CASH token.

2017 was a huge year for the entire crypto industry. It was then that Bitcoin became the most popular word of the year. The main cryptocurrency at that time rose from $800 to $20,000, and the rest of the altcoins followed this movement and turned their holders into rich.

Digital money has gained worldwide recognition. Naturally, the crypto phenomenon has attracted the attention of major players in the financial industry. At this very time, several traders leave the large European stock exchange Euronext and join the crypto game. A few months later, they called themselves Corsair, and their main mission was to fight the dirty trading methods of those we used to call whales.

Becoming

According to the Corsair founders, they have extensive experience trading on the largest European stock exchange, Euronext. This exchange has been operating since 2000. From the first days of the European Union’s existence, the question arose of harmonizing inter-exchange relations and requirements for platforms, players and issuers. Its capitalization is estimated at over $6 trillion.

The Euronext exchange, from where Corsair came out, has a 20-year history and branches across all continents of the planet. Therefore, it will be difficult to say exactly where the core of Corsair is. It can be assumed that their main center was founded either in Paris or in Brussels, because there are Euronext exchanges that are engaged in futures trading. This is the main type of trading, the experience of which can be transferred to the crypto market.

From the very beginning, only trade was in their plans. But after months of observing very strange market moves, Corsair decided that someone was playing a foul game and was using their mass to lock in the profits of hundreds or even thousands of people in a single move. It was then that this team decided to challenge the whales. Corsair does not recognize anyone’s power or influence, be it a major exchange or one major holder. They throw anyone who manipulates prices in bad faith ashore.

It took them several years to hone their whale hunting skills and assemble a team that shares a common idea and mission. With each market fluctuation, more and more people join the team who want to make money together and return what they lost earlier. During this time, the Corsairs lured over 30 experienced traders from all over the world to their ship. More than 500 trading bots trained in whale detection and extermination are working under their banner.

Idea and mission

Over the past couple of years, partners have appeared in different parts of the world, and more and more ordinary people are joining them. Because they are not satisfied with the constant loss of money. Corsairs track the movement of whales and lead them several steps ahead. They invite trusted investors to private groups where they warn of whale movements. The main goal of this community is to collect the profits dispersed by the whales before they do it. Look for entry to Corsair’s gated communities on their official info channels.

Corsair has now tokenized its mission. They launched the CASH token, which is becoming the main accumulation tool for the team to throw whales ashore. Token sale CASH is underway now. You can purchase pirates’ coins on their official marketplace.

https://corsair.world/

Corsair will transfer most of the trading profits to the CASH liquidity pool. Thus, you can always earn by keeping funds in toĸen CASH. Corsair has the technology used by most cryptocurrency hedge funds. Technology constantly monitors the activity of the addresses of the largest investors. When large assets are moved, these technologies are activated and inform the community about the reasons and plans of the trader.

Token CASH has already gathered a large community in all corners of the cryptocurrency business around the world and, accordingly, will collect a fairly large capitalization. The corsairs are building their own republic – their DEX CORSAIR. This will force people to be considered dreams in the global cryptocurrency market – and for this, we need a large army of like-minded people. Become CryptoCorsair and strike a balance in your direction!

DeFi Farming is a profitability or liquidity platform where users can provide liquidity and place bets in exchange for Corsair CASH. Corsair Farming will begin in Q4 2021. The farm formula will be published shortly before the launch date. Due to the recent changes in today’s DeFi world, the team needs to be very flexible and innovative in terms of the farming formula developed in order to ensure the attractiveness and visibility of the CASH farm. Corsair Farming is the only platform where you can earn CASH. In addition, CASH Farming will include unique pools to help you earn CASH and other coins/tokens in the future. What happens when someone wants to work?

Let’s say Jack buys 1 CASH for 300 USDT using the BNB USDT pool. By doing this, it increases the USD stake in the pool and decreases the CASH stake in the pool. In fact, this means that the price of CASH is going up. Why? There is less CASH left in the pool after the transaction, and we know that the total liquidity “k” should remain constant.

This mechanism determines the price. Ultimately, the price paid for the CASH price depends on whether the transaction changes the relationship between “x” and “y”. It is worth noting that this model does not scale linearly, because the larger the order, the more the balance between “x” and “y” shifts. This means that larger orders become exponentially more expensive than smaller ones, resulting in more and more slippage. Consequently, the larger the liquidity pool, the easier it is to process large orders. Why? In this case, the shift between x and y is smaller.

How to make the most of the CASH token?

In late August, Corsair launched a private sale of CASH tokens. Now the closest participants are recruited into the project, for whom special conditions will open from the very beginning. You can be part of the crew and part of the Corsair ship at the lowest price during pre-sale – 5 cents ($0.05) per 1 CASH. Also, the first of the first will receive an additional opportunity – to earn on CASH token staking even before entering the first exchange. The minimum cost for a front-row ticket is $77. A maximum of one hand can dispense CASH of up to $7,777. The starting price on the first exchange starts at $0.1

Headhunting in the blockchain biz - DTNext,"Chennai :

It’s an important query as not everyone is setting out to become a crypto miner. There are millions of individuals who are now looking at cryptocurrency and blockchain and trying to understand where they fit in, in terms of the value chain.





A few statistics might shed some light on the prospects of employment in this newfangled sector of technology. According to data collated from employment portals, blockchain is one of the fields that is witnessing the fastest-growing demand vis-a-vis skill sets. Job sites have seen as much as a 2,000 to 6,000 per cent growth when it comes to opportunities in the sector. Over 10,000 active employment opportunities are available in the cryptocurrency space in India, as per data from the specialist staffing firm Xpheno.





Global tech giants including the likes of JP Morgan, IBM, Microsoft and Intel are already recruiting blockchain developers in huge numbers.





Even back home, companies such as Reliance Infocomm, Bajaj Electricals, Mahindra Group and Yes Bank have integrated blockchain based technologies in their processes. The net impact on the industry is also quite significant with a projected contribution of $62.2 billion in 2030.





This area of technology is slated to affect major lines of businesses, and projected contribution will be to the tune $41 bn in supply chain, $13.2 bn in securitisation and payments and $5 bn in identity protection applications.





Mudia Chauhan, who heads HR at CoinDCX, India’s first crypto unicorn, in a recent interview said that it is hiring people in the tech space who can strengthen its product, enhance security and build platforms.





“The skills which we focus on are Node. js, cyber security, blockchain, AWS, Java, PHP, Python and data structures.”





As per a PwC report, 56 per cent of Indian businesses are inclined to make this technology a part of their core business process in near future.





So demand for those designing blockchain platforms or applications will be in huge demand. Interestingly, the demand for blockchain-related jobs is greater in south, with Bengaluru, the IT hub, garnering a demand of 36 per cent as per Indeed’s Data. Incidentally, Mumbai, Gurugram and Bengaluru collectively account for 60 per cent of the job opportunities in the cryptocurrency space.





The paycheques pertaining to opportunities in the space are also quite lucrative. A front-end developer with an experience ranging between two to five years can bag as much as Rs 30 lakh per annum, while an engineer with eight plus years of work experience can expect a pay package of Rs 50 lakh per annum. The top of the crypto pyramid is occupied by blockchain specialists with 12 years plus experience who can draw a cool Rs 75 lakh every year.

"El Salvador President Buys Bitcoin Dip But Rules Out 'ANY KIND OF REFORM' On Abortion Rights, Same-Sex Ma - Benzinga","El Salvador’s President and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) bull Nayib Bukele has decided not to propose reforms related to what he described as the “right to life” or marriage equality.

What Happened: The Salvadoran president, in a Facebook post, said the proposed reforms to be sent to the country’s Congress will not decriminalize abortion, legalize same-sex marriage, or permit euthanasia, as reported by Reuters.

""I have decided, to dispel ANY DOUBT, NOT TO PROPOSE ANY KIND OF REFORM TO ANY ITEMS RELATED TO the RIGHT TO LIFE (from the moment of conception), to marriage (keeping only the original design, A MAN AND A WOMAN) or to euthanasia,"" Bukele is reported to have written on his Facebook page.

The measures were sent to Bukele by the country’s Vice President Felix Ulloa and include extension and early termination of the presidential term and the formation of a new body to replace the current electoral tribunal, as per Reuters.

The president did not mention any plans to extend his term and did not say when these would be sent to Congress.

Why It Matters: Reuters noted that El Salvador has some of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the Americas.

Meanwhile, in the early hours of Monday, Bukele dished out what he termed “Presidential advice” on Twitter, saying “they can never beat you if you buy the dips.”

The president announced El Salvador purchased 150 new BTC ratcheting up the country’s holdings to 700 BTC.

We just bought the dip. 150 new coins! El Salvador now holds 700 coins.#Bitcoin — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) September 20, 2021

A single BTC at press time cost $45,788.07, the cryptocurrency fell 4.71% over 24 hours. This means El Salvador now holds $32.05 million worth of BTC.

Crypto Twitter noted the president’s stance on issues surrounding LGBTQ rights and abortion.

While crypto twitter gushes over @nayibbukele I wanted to remind everyone on two of his political views that stand out: Gay marriage – very opposed

Aborton – opposed even for rape and incest victims I'm an adult, so I give him credit for a bold stance on $btc but that is all. — Jay Smith (@jaynemesis) June 7, 2021

Congratulations @nayibbukele on the acceptance of #Bitcoin but what about gay marriage and abortion right? — Martian BTC (@MartianBtc) June 6, 2021

Last week, the Salvadorian capital saw riots on its independence day where protestors set fire to a BTC ATM, as per Decrypt.

Bukele, who was among the 100 most influential people chosen by Time, has been accused of brooking “no criticism or opposition” by the Mexican journalist Daniel Lizárraga who claims to have been expelled from El Salvador.

As we know the capitalization amounts in the billions of dollars, this indicates the prospects for investing in ADA. Given the global plans of the project developers to improve it and the fact that some of them have already been implemented, the future of Cardano is quite optimistic. Perhaps in a few years, it will be possible to carry out full-fledged non-cash payments with this coin, and the official wallet (Daedalus Wallet) will be used to store various types of cryptocurrencies.

ETH/USD: Past Week of Nervousness Creating Short-Term Worry - DailyForex.com,"ETH/USD is trading around the 3200.00 vicinity as of this morning in rather fast conditions. ETH/USD skidded to nearly 3146.00 in late night trading and is certainly challenging important mid-term support levels. The past week of trading has seen Ethereum produce some steady values, but incrementally it has not been able to achieve a steady climb and has definitely faced plenty of reversals lower.

On the 16th of September, ETH/USD did climb to a high of nearly 3680.00, after testing a low of approximately 3100.00 on the 13th of September. These values are underscored to acknowledge ETH/USD remains a volatile speculative asset even if it is the number two ranked cryptocurrency regarding market capitalization. The price range between the 13th and 16th, also illustrates the lows and highs for ETH/USD which are still capable of being tested in the short term if the current range holds.

However, the broad cryptocurrency market has shown a nervous trend the past few weeks after hitting rather alluring values early in September. ETH/USD led the charge and outperformed most of its counterparts late in August and into the first week of this month, but since then a rather lackluster technical trend for bullish speculators have been produced.

Traders who have had the ability to sell ETH/USD the past couple of weeks and withstood its reversals, and remain bearish may have a reason technically to continue pursuing downside momentum. If the current price range of ETH/USD falters and the 3175.00 to 3150.00 levels are challenged, there is reason to suspect the 3100.00 mark can be legitimately tested. Targeting these values must be done using a limited amount of leverage because it is very ambitious, and a move in the opposite direction could be extremely costly.

ETH/USD does appear to be caught in a rather strong storm which is producing headwinds temporarily. If a speculator decides to sell ETH/USD they may want to look for slight reversals higher, but a better approach may be to wait for Ethereum to actually trigger support levels below. Entering a limit order which sells on growing bearish momentum near the 3175.00 level and using support ratios beneath as take profit targets could prove to be a worthwhile wager in the short term.

Ransomware Attacks Growing More Sophisticated - Security Boulevard,"Cybercriminals attacked with gusto in the first half of 2021 and attacks show no signs of slowing down. In just the first half of the year, malicious actors exploited dangerous vulnerabilities across different types of devices and operating systems, leading to major attacks that shut down fuel networks and extracted millions from enterprises.

These were among the results of a midyear security roundup from Trend Micro, which detected 7.3 million ransomware threats in the first six months of 2021. Despite the high-profile coverage ransomware has so far received, detections actually decreased by 50% year-over-year.

However, the attacks that occurred in the first half of 2021 were highly sophisticated, targeted and complex, making them more detrimental to victims.

Ransomware Targeted Banking

The banking industry was disproportionately affected, experiencing a 1,318% year-over-year increase in ransomware attacks in the first half of 2021, while other industries that found themselves under heavy fire included government and manufacturing.

Timur Kovalev, chief technology officer at Untangle, a provider of network security for SMBs, explained that cybercriminals have found their “sweet spot” with government, manufacturing, banking and critical infrastructure.

“Previous ransomware attacks stole or accessed data and held that hostage while demanding a ransom and threatening to leak or sell the data,” he said. “Malicious actors have recently targeted specific companies where they can cause severe disruption to services and society, in general, knowing these entities will pay the ransom to get services up and running as soon as possible.”

Kovalev pointed out that ransomware attacks are increasing because companies are paying the ransom.

“It’s been reported that JBS paid $11 million in ransom. The Colonial Pipeline also paid a $4.4 million ransom, although a good portion has been returned,” he said. “Cybercriminals see the large payouts and it encourages them to strike more often and at larger, more lucrative targets.”

Stefano De Blasi a cyberthreat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows, a provider of digital risk protection solutions, agreed that attacks aimed at government, manufacturing and banking organizations are getting more frequent and intense due to the potential for high payout.

“You have to remember that cybercriminals’ top priority is simply to get paid at the end of an offensive operation,” he said. “They are able to monetize more effectively when targeted organizations hold sensitive information and cannot afford any downtime due to production needs.”

In the past 18 months, De Blasi noted, ransomware operations have become more frequent and profitable than ever. Within this timeframe, a few ransomware groups managed to establish well-organized ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) programs and become renowned players in the threat landscape, he noted.

“On the other hand, although we’ve observed dozens more smaller ransomware groups appearing on the scene, these groups often struggle to establish long-lasting operations when competing with the technical and financial resources of established RaaS programs,” he said.

Kovalev explained that when it comes to cryptocurrency miners—which have become the most-detected type of malware, according to the Trend Micro report—hackers have taken to requesting payment in the form of cryptocurrency because they can transport vast amounts of money across international boundaries in seconds.

“The ease and quickness of transactions, coupled with lack of traceability, have made it the go-to solution for ransomware hackers,” he said. “Because the cryptocurrency exchanges often take place overseas, governmental regulatory power and law enforcement of the transactions is limited.”

In addition, many of these cyber thieves live outside of the U.S. in countries like Russia, making it even more difficult to trace them or catch them in the act.

Lowering the Barrier to Entry

De Blasi added that not only is this malware relatively cheap and easy to use, but some listings also offer the opportunity to have the malware already installed on a victim’s machine.

“This mechanism has increasingly lowered the barrier to entry and caused many inexperienced threat actors to use this malware as a side gig,” he said. “Unsurprisingly, security professionals often detect these unsophisticated actors because of their inability to cover their tracks.”

Kovalev noted that while ransomware attacks continue and the ransom amounts demanded increase, there are several defensive moves companies and governments can make to help prevent ransomware attacks in the future.

“First and foremost, companies should not pay the ransom,” he said. “Law enforcement agencies encourage organizations not to pay fees to cybercriminals, as it encourages more attacks.”

Kovalev also called for more consistent policies for international cooperation.

“It’s time to recognize that this is an international issue and that the most effective way to stop ransomware is by developing a global solution,” he said. “Business and government leaders must work together to readily share information, develop prosecution agreements for cybercriminals and impose sanctions against rogue nations that harbor cyber pirates.”

He added that to combat attacks, large corporations that could be targeted may begin to add cryptocurrency and blockchain specialists to their security teams.

“Those with investigative and tracing skills may soon be in high demand for law enforcement and businesses,” he said.

De Blasi said security teams can increase the robustness of their defensive strategies by making themselves a difficult target.

“Cybercriminals are typically opportunistic, financially-motivated actors who target low-hanging fruit,” he said. “Therefore, by following basic cybersecurity hygiene best practices and sticking to their threat model, security teams have more chances to adopt a proactive and agile posture that would place them in a much better position.”

He warned that cybercriminals are constantly improving and updating their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to stay one step ahead of security professionals, and have now reached an “impressive” level of sophistication in their operations.

“Keeping pace with threat actors is a daunting task for every security team and can often result in a whack-a-mole game,” De Blasi said.",https://securityboulevard.com/2021/09/ransomware-attacks-growing-more-sophisticated/,2021-09-20 06:09:26,Security Boulevard,https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/canstockphoto27773385.jpg,"Cybercriminals attacked with gusto in the first half of 2021 and attacks show no signs of slowing down.

Collective investment schemes requires 100% custody – SEC - Nairametrics,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that all Collective Investment Schemes in Nigeria must require 100% custody requirements and commenced policies to implement the rules.

This was disclosed in a statement by the Director-General of the SEC, Mr Lamido Yuguda in Lagos on Sunday.

The SEC said the custody requirement must cover all funds and portfolios being managed by registered Fund/Portfolio Managers, adding that clients who are managed under discretionary and non-discretionary mandates were to be held under independent custodial agreement, including, Mutual Funds authorised for public offering.

What the SEC boss said

Yuguda said, “For example, we have the collective business sector where you have the fund managers.

“We have a dichotomy between public funds, which are funds that are publicly traded, and you can see the unique values on the stock exchange and in newspapers daily.

“There are also private, which are investment agreements between fund managers and specific investors.

“A lot of these funds in the privately-held fund management mandates are in our custody.

“The investment manager before now did not only have the investment management responsibility for the fund, but also kept the securities and cash as whole shares in this investment.

“The risk is that if the investment manager should go bust, then the investor loses and that is not acceptable in financial markets around the world.”

He said that the introduction of total custody in that sector will lead to a massive uptake of these kinds of products, adding that the SEC has released regulations recently in this area for the different types of fund managers, and that the sector is now becoming increasingly attractive to investors and is also receiving the attention of the commission.

Yuguda also stated that with the new 100% custody requirement in the CIS sector, investors in the capital markets will be confident that their investments are safe, which will lead to growth in the sector, including other policies to protect investors, which the SEC is working on.

“We have a Fintech division in the commission that was set up purposefully to understand these new types of investment structures and to collaborate with Fintech firms that wish to register as capital market operators and offer services to the investing public,” he added.

“This is a developing area, and we intend to issue new regulations from time to time,” he said.

In case you missed it

Nairametrics reported earlier this month that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that it has set up a Fintech division to study cryptocurrency investments and products in order to help it initiate policies that will help regulate the sector.

The SEC boss also added last week that the SEC has supported and acquired the emergence of various technology-driven innovations around market operations and products some of which include Fintech, Digital Assets and Crowdfunding, through the development of a regulatory framework to galvanize these activities while focusing on managing the risk inherent in the products and activities in-line with our mandate of market development and investor protection.",https://nairametrics.com/2021/09/20/collective-investment-schemes-requires-100-custody-sec/,2021-09-20 05:30:39,Nairametrics,https://i2.wp.com/nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lamido-Yuguda-1.jpeg?fit=900%2C569&ssl=1,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that all Collective Investment Schemes in Nigeria must require 100% custody requirements and commenced policies to implement the rules.

Ripple Vs SEC: The Settlement is Still a No Go for Ripple! High Hopes on Gensler - Coinpedia,"Ripple Vs SEC: The Settlement is Still a No Go for Ripple! High Hopes on Gensler

As reported by Fox Business, Ripple’s legal team has no plans to settle the dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States (SEC).

Reporter Charles Gasparino tweeted that Ripple believes that pursuing the lawsuit would persuade SEC Chairman Gary Gensler that it is picking winners and losers in the crypto industry at the expense of innovation.

BREAKING: @Ripple's legal team tell @FoxBusiness they have no plans to settle w @SEC_Enforcement over lawsuit on XRP, confident they can show @GaryGensler in pursuing the case is picking winners and losers in the #Crypto business to the detriment of innovation. Story developing — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) September 17, 2021

Supporters of Ripple and XRP are hoping that the new SEC chairman, Gary Gensler, who previously taught cryptography at MIT, will dismiss the XRP litigation.

They claim that former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton had a conflict of interest. In August, a government investigator began looking into the circumstances surrounding Clayton and senior SEC official William Hinman’s XRP lawsuit.

Gensler has demonstrated that he is open to new ideas. “Do you support responsible innovation?” Senator Cynthia Lummis, a pro-bitcoin member of the Senate Banking Committee, asked him during a hearing last week. “Oh my gosh, yes,” Gensler said right away.

The Chairman has said, Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovation is real, “His innovation sparked the creation of crypto assets and the underlying blockchain technology,”

He also stated that “it has been and could continue to be a catalyst for change in the disciplines of finance and money.”

Critic Brandt says XRP is a security

Peter Brandt, a commodity trader with more than four decades of experience, continues to believe that XRP is unregistered security.

Under new SEC head we will have many more challenges of this type. Personally I think XRP is a security, but that would not prevent me from owning it under the right circumstances. — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) September 20, 2021

Brandt, a long-time Ripple opponent, publicly petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to designate XRP as security just two months before the case was filed. He also charged the firm with rigging the price of the contentious cryptocurrency.

However, the veteran trader would own the Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency “under the appropriate circumstances,” despite the regulatory ambiguity around it.",https://coinpedia.org/ripple/settlement-is-still-a-no-go-for-ripple/,2021-09-20 06:21:53,Coinpedia,http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/17182720/Social-Media-Image.jpg,"Ripple Vs SEC: The Settlement is Still a No Go for Ripple!
