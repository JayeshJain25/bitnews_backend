Bitcoin in El Salvador: President Nayib Bukele Steps in to Fix Cryptocurrency Rollout Snags - Gadgets 360,"Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele stepped in on Wednesday to manage the fraught roll-out of a payments app that underpins the nation's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, and called on users to report any problems on his Twitter feed.

Adopting language similar to IT departments in offices around the world, Bukele asked users to close and restart the app if a ""currently under maintenance"" error screen appeared.

The historic adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender by the Central American country has been beset by problems that have contributed to a rout in the value of the digital currency globally. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.4 lakhs as of 10am IST on September 9.

Bitcoin continued to lose ground on Wednesday, closing at $46,000 (roughly Rs. 33.93 lakhs), down by 1.7 percent.

""Any financial innovation on this scale is going to come with teething problems. However, if we've learnt anything from watching the markets in the past year, it's that Bitcoin maximalists will seek to push the digital currency back up just as quickly as it has fallen,"" said Michael Kamerman, chief executive of Scandinavian-owned fintech company Skilling.

Some market watchers see a bullish future, with a new cryptocurrency research team at Standard Chartered predicting Bitcoin will hit $100,000 (roughly Rs. 73.7 lakhs) by early next year and could be worth as much as $175,000 (roughly Rs. 1.3 crores) longer-term.

Bukele has sent a stream of Twitter messages over the past 36 hours instructing users on how to download the government-backed Chivo app which promises commission-free transactions and which his administration hopes will be adopted by the unbanked.

Overnight the president said the app, a digital wallet, was being disconnected for the second time to ""improve user experience and the problems it had during the day.""

""We hope that tomorrow will be much better,"" he wrote in a tweet.

Several users replied in his comments section to report ongoing installation problems.

Douglas Rodriguez, head of El Salvador's central bank, said during an event in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa that the ""eyes of the world"" were on his country and that the Bitcoin adoption was a process that needed time to ""mature.""

Addressing concerns the digital currency could encourage illicit activity, Rodriguez said the rules set out by the bank for using Bitcoin were designed to meet money laundering standards andSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele stepped in on Wednesday to manage the fraught roll-out of a payments app that underpins the nation's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, and called on users to report any problems on his Twitter feed.

El Salvador's Bitcoin law states the market will establish the exchange rate between the cryptocurrency and the US dollar, the nation's other legal tender. It says all prices may be expressed in Bitcoin and tax contributions can be paid in digital currency, while currency transactions in Bitcoin are not subject to capital gains taxes.

Fine tuning

Notwithstanding technical hiccups, the app's rollout created some waves in El Salvador, in part due to a government handout of $30 (roughly Rs. 2,210) in Bitcoin to every local user who signs up, and despite polls that show many people are wary of Bitcoin's volatility.

On the El Salvador edition of Apple's App Store, Chivo was the No. 1 downloaded financial app on Wednesday.

Bukele earlier said only a few phone models would initially have access to the app on Alphabet's Google Play to avoid a rush that could collapse the system.

On Wednesday afternoon, he wrote on Twitter that Google Play was available for Alcatel smartphones and that more models would be added, though it was important ""not to saturate the servers"" with too many registrations at the same time.

""We are still fine-tuning small details,"" he said.

Reuters could not immediately determine how many times the app had been downloaded.

JP Morgan Chase said in a note on Wednesday that some technical snags are to be expected.

""These technical issues should not be a surprise given the country had only three months to prepare for this grand experiment,"" the bank said. ""In sharp contrast, China has been preparing/testing its digital yuan for years and has yet to officially launch it.""

Global retailers operating in El Salvador were accepting Bitcoin at some stores, including McDonald's and Starbucks, along with several local outlets.

Bukele, 40, who is doing well in opinion polls but has been accused of eroding democracy, has heavily used social media to govern and engage with Salvadorans.

"Cryptocurrency Being Eyed by Central Banks of Honduras, Guatemala, Following El Salvador’s Bitcoin Adop... - Gadgets 360","The central banks of Honduras and Guatemala are eying digital currencies, officials said on Wednesday, following El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as legal currency.

The central bank presidents for Honduras and Guatemala both said the banks were studying digital currencies with the aim of eventually introducing them into the economy, including via a central bank digital currency.

El Salvador on Tuesday made history with its adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, though the launch of its government-backed digital wallet hit snags including technological glitches and an angry protest by mistrustful citizens. Bitcoin price in India stood at Rs. 36.4 lakhs as of 10am IST on September 9.

""The Central Bank of Honduras has also recently begun, approved by the board of directors, to initiate the study..... to determine the feasibility of conducting a pilot test issuing its own digital money or a central bank digital currency,"" said Honduras central bank president Wilfredo Cerrato, speaking at a regional economic forum in Tegucigalpa.

Cerrato said the adoption of digital currencies in Central American countries should be addressed in the Central American Monetary Council, which brings together central bank authorities.

Guatemala's central bank vice president Jose Alfredo Blanco said the bank was studying the possibility of a local digital currency that would be called iQuetzal.

""It will take perhaps a long time to complete the investigation phase,"" Blanco said, adding that a committee had been formed six months ago.

Shiba Inu Withdraws Amid Major Weakness In Cryptocurrency Markets - Bollyinside - BollyInside,"Ethereum failed to settle above the psychologically important $4,000 level and moved below $3,900. Dogecoin is currently trying to settle below $0.30 while XRP is testing the support at $1.35. Shiba Inu is currently trying to settle below the support level at $0.000007 while Bitcoin is moving lower. The world’s leading cryptocurrency has managed to settle above the resistance at $51,500 and made an attempt to settle above the next resistance level at $53,000. This attempt yielded no results and Bitcoin pulled back, which triggered a pullback in many cryptocurrencies.

Technical Analysis

Bitcoin Dominance, which measures the market capitalization of Bitcoin as a percentage of total crypto market capitalization, has recently moved away from lows near 41%. It should be noted that the recent decline of Bitcoin Dominance provided no material support to Shiba Inu as traders focused on major altcoins.

Shiba Inu settled below the support at $0.00000745 and got to the test of the next support level at $0.000007. RSI remains in the moderate territory, and there is plenty of room to gain additional downside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.

In case Shiba Inu declines below the support level at $0.000007, it will move towards the next support at $0.0000067. A successful test of this level will push Shiba Inu towards the support which is located at the recent lows at $0.0000065. If Shiba Inu settles below this support level, it will head towards the next support at $0.0000063.

On the upside, the nearest resistance level for Shiba Inu is located at $0.00000745. A move above this level will push Shiba Inu towards the resistance near the recent highs at $0.0000077. In case Shiba Inu gets above this level, it will head towards the next resistance level at $0.000008. A successful test of this level will provide Shiba Inu with an opportunity to get to the test of the next resistance at $0.0000085.

"Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit crypto contracts extended by Shinhan, NongHyup Bank - EconoTimes","Shinhan Bank and NongHyup Bank have renewed their respective contracts with Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit in a move to extend their business relationship. It was reported that the leading local banks revealed the decision to stretch their agreement with the said cryptocurrency exchanges on Wednesday, Sept. 8.

As per The Korea Times, both Shinhan Bank and NongHyup Bank made the decision to continue their contracts with the three cryptocurrency exchanges since they have taken steps to verify, register, and comply with the regulations, especially with the anti-money laundering protocols.

Prior to the extension, only Upbit, another crypto exchange, was able to continue its business without issues after reporting to the Financial Services Commission (FSC) when it renewed its agreement with K bank. It also complied with the updated requirements set by the regulators and related offices monitoring cryptocurrency so its operation in South Korea went on smoothly.

The Korea Financial Intelligence Unit, a sub-unit working under FSC, set Sept. 24 as the deadline for crypto exchanges to report their business, and Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit worked together to get approvals by forming a joint venture they named CODE or Onnect Digital Exchanges. It was the solution for them to satisfy the rules and meet the set deadline, especially with the crypto “travel rule” system to prevent and combat money laundering.

Shinhan Bank extended its contract with Korbit while NongHyup Bank confirmed its renewed agreement with Bithumb and Coinone. At this point, and just two weeks before the deadline, four crypto exchanges in S. Korea have already received approvals to keep their platforms going. Based on the estimation by the financial regulator, about 60 crypto exchanges are operating in the country.

""Fears of mass shutdowns of minor exchanges loom larger, as they will have a hard time finding a partner in the bank industry,"" a business insider shared. ""The authority is on track to restructure the industry with toughened regulations, and small exchanges will not be able to endure the watchdog's pressure in the end.""

Meanwhile, prior to the latest partnership extensions between Shinhan and Nonghyup Bank and Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, BeinCrypto reported in July that the two financial institutions already granted the three with temporary extension while they review if they can still issue new contracts with them but this will only be in effect until Sept. 24. Fortunately, the crypto exchanges were able to work things out and as reported, they can now continue with their businesses.",https://www.econotimes.com/Bithumb-Coinone-Korbit-crypto-contracts-extended-by-Shinhan-NongHyup-Bank-1616819,2021-09-09,EconoTimes,https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/202109096789ac2cec8f88090_th_1024x0.png,none
How Crypto gaming (GameFi) is emerging as the new way to make money - The Financial Express,"Crypto gaming stands out since it allows users to add value to their purchases. Representative image

As cryptos continue to be a global phenomenon, industries all around the world are looking for more ways to incorporate this frankly revolutionary technology into their core products and services. Online gaming, in particular, has become a breeding ground for exciting innovation in this space. Developers are inventing new methods to leverage cryptos to purchase and trade in-game products, cosmetics, unlock characters, and much more. The convergence of the virtual and the real – our metaverse – has never looked so good.

Video games have considerably evolved in the past few decades. In fact, the global gaming market, which was valued at USD 173.70 billion in 2020, is predicted to reach USD 314.40 billion by 2026, with a CAGR of 9.64% between 2021 and 2026. Some of the biggest video gaming companies include Sony, Tencent, Nintendo, and Microsoft, each having gaming revenue of over 10 billion dollars. Sony tops the list, with a massive revenue of about 25 billion dollars. Electronic Arts (EA Games), Sega Games, Konami Holdings Corporations and Gameloft, are some of the most prominent gaming studios in the world.

While 2020 witnessed several economies shutting down as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, the video gaming industry was one of the few sectors that experienced an unexpected boom. With several nations imposing nationwide lockdowns, people naturally resorted to seeking entertainment within their homes during the successive rounds of restrictions.

Several big game producers claimed a massive growth in revenue from sales as well as an active user base in 2020, including Activision Blizzard, Epic Games, and Electronic Arts. The surge in active users was also mirrored in the increase of in-game purchases.

The growth of crypto gaming

With the advancements in PC and mobile gaming, there has been a noticeable increase in the gaming industry’s interest in cryptos. Undoubtedly, crypto games are now disrupting the traditional games market by allowing players to earn while playing, thereby rewarding their time and effort.

In a report published by the Worldwide Asset exchange, it was stated that over 75% of online gamers wanted to exchange their virtual assets for a currency that would be used across multiple platforms. Crypto gaming has grown in popularity largely due to its ability to allow players to collect and trade virtual assets that can be exchanged and traded anywhere in the world. It has also proven to be a secure and simple way for the gaming industry to earn money.

How does crypto gaming work?

It is a well-known fact that one can easily buy and sell cryptos via digital wallets using crypto exchanges. So, how does crypto function in the world of online gaming? Here’s how.

Affiliate marketing, in-app purchases, and in-app advertising are typical monetization tactics in traditional online gaming. Furthermore, gamers today are quite familiar with in-game coins such as the coins you have when you’re playing Monopoly or mobile games like CandyCrush. But for so long, these coins have had no value beyond the scope of the game, that is terrible.

This is where crypto gaming stands out since it allows users to add value to their purchases. Store tokens, such as in-game products, are often stored on a distributed ledger atop a crypto network in crypto games. This distributed ledger, known as the blockchain, is what allows game products to be traded for cryptocurrency, which can subsequently be transferred for real money.

In-app purchases allow players to buy items like coins, extra lives, custom characters, outfits, accessories, etc., directly from the game. When applying this to crypto gaming, in-app purchases are carried out when players buy items using cryptocurrency or buying the crypto itself. In contrast, in traditional games, assets are typically bought from a central developer owned store which makes the developers rich and not the players who play them.

Moreover, in traditional games, the game life cycle cannot be controlled by players. When the server is turned off, unused virtual properties will be taken away by the operator and the player will have no access over it. All ownership of any merchandise in the game belongs only to the game operator, not the player.

Although digital ownership exists in modern-day games, they do not come with the value or stakes that crypto games allow. While you may be able to own in-game assets, you cannot sell them to other players. When compared to this, the entire concept is very different in crypto games, from ownership of virtual assets to its decentralized operation, and the fact that players’ assets are globally distributed and not limited solely for gaming purposes.

Earn money with crypto gaming

In essence, crypto games are video games that run on a cryptocurrency network and include a completely or partially distributed ledger architecture, providing players verifiable ownership over the virtual products contained in the games. As a result, players can trade virtual products for cryptocurrency, which can be traded for real money.

All this while, it was only developers of the game or the games studios who made profits from the virtual coins that were sold to the gamers or users because these assets had only vanity value to them. This meant that almost everything you could buy in a game (e.g., skin, armor, upgrades, etc.) had only a limited value, despite users spending real money to purchase them.

But with the emergence of crypto games, the status quo is now evolving. While regular games have fundamentally been about entertainment, crypto games bring forward entertainment with the added advantage of earning real money while playing. Every time a player buys an asset, they indirectly increase the value of the game economy. Axie Infinity, CropBytes and Gods Unchained are few of the most popular crypto games that allow players to earn money by using virtual products to achieve in-game objectives.

A typical example is CropBytes, a homegrown crypto game. With this farm simulation game, players can grow their portfolios of assets by using NFTs and cryptos in their own farms. A favorite of more than 80,000 CropBytes users, this crypto game gives users the ability to leverage the power of crypto to earn money through playing.

NFT Gaming

With crypto games rising in popularity, so has the NFT gaming sector. In the first quarter of 2021, crypto gaming experienced an upgrade in the form of NFT games, which transitioned from Play to Earn games to collectible games based on the Pay to Earn principle. Trends have always propelled the gaming industry, and the latest trend in NFTs is no exception. While it is no secret that the NFT market has grown to become a billion dollar market, without a doubt, games are one of the best-suited use cases of NFTs. Much of the NFT industry is now focused on gaming, which has enormous potential for providing gamers with unique in-game item collection options.

Although the terms crypto gaming and NFT gaming are frequently used interchangeably, there is a significant difference between the two. While crypto gaming focuses on using crypto coins to transact with other players, native tokens are utilized to generate or gather NFTs in NFT gaming. Through NFT gaming, any assets in the game like utility, armor, land, or any asset, can become NFT and can easily be owned, transferred, and sold on the blockchain. The NFT gaming platform also gives gamers access to NFT markets to buy and sell one-of-a-kind NFTs. Axie Infinity is a popular NFT-based online video game that is currently the most expensive NFTs collection, with more than $42 million in sales in June 2021.

Furthermore, a new type of blockchain gaming that combines decentralized finance (DeFi) features with gaming is also gaining traction, this is also known as GameFi. MOBOX, a BSC-based game, is one such game that blends NFT collectibles with yield farming and other DeFi services. We should see a lot of supporting products around GameFi (Game Finance) which give crypto games new dimensions. For example players can collateralized their game assets to take loans or simply borrow an asset for in game activity to yield more assets. There are many creative ways to earn.

Although most games are currently designed around NFTs in the crypto space, FTs are also gaining popularity. Unlike non-fungible tokens, fungible tokens can be replicated and exchanged with the same value for one another.

Liquidity in the crypto gaming market

Given how crypto games are heavily dependent on the game market, it is also important to address the liquidity levels in these markets. In its most basic form, liquidity refers to the maximum amount of assets that can be bought and sold at any point in time within the game market. The more the liquidity, the healthier the market; hence liquidity is a good indicator of any marketplace.

To increase liquidity, the crypto game market can comprise both NFT and FT assets. While FT assets can be scaled to have high liquidity marketplaces and thereby be used for utility/consumables assets in the game, NFT assets can be used more for their rarity, which usually has high value but low volume transactions.

Looking forward

I have been passionate about gaming, starting from a very young age building counter strike maps. I have always been a gamer, with a passion to work in the gaming field. With the crypto gaming sector now growing to unprecedented heights, I am definitely enthralled by the opportunities this presents and super excited to work with new gaming projects and startups.

As more money is now being invested in the market, there’s no doubt that crypto gaming is all set to become an industry of its own. Several studios are also now jumping to the crypto gaming bandwagon, in an attempt to capitalize on the latest trend.

That being said, it’s only practical that the growth of the online gaming industry is something that crypto gaming should seek to exploit since it has apparent benefits for both players and developers. From the potential to earn to ease of transactions, the ability to play anywhere, and the enhanced levels of safety and security, crypto gaming improves the overall gaming experience for gamers while providing new income streams for developers. Let’s play.

Ukraine Passes Legislation To Recognize And Regulate Crypto - Todayuknews - Todayuknews,"The Ukrainian Parliament has adopted legislation regulating foriegn and domestic cryptocurrency exchanges operating from within the country.

On Sept. 8, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted the draft law “On Virtual Assets,” legally recognizing cryptocurrency in the country for the first time. The legislation is based on the existing standards developed by the intergovernmental policy-making organization, Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF).

The Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation will be tasked with overseeing the implementation of the new virtual asset regulation and guiding the industry’s growth, in adherence with “international standards.

Anastasia Bratko of the Ministry of Digital Transformation said the law allows companies to launch virtual asset markets in Ukraine and enables banks to “open accounts for crypto companies.

“Ukrainians will also be able to declare their income in virtual assets,” she said, adding that the law “guarantees judicial protection of the rights to virtual asset owners.”

An announcement from the ministry emphasized that “the country will receive additional tax revenues to the budget, which will be paid by crypto companies,” adding:

“The adopted norms establish rules for service providers related to the circulation of virtual assets and contribute to the market’s de-shadowing.”

Virtual asset service providers (VASPs) “must have an impeccable business reputation” and will be required to disclose their ownership structure to identify their ultimate beneficial owners. Internal anti-money launder measures must also be maintained by VASPs.

Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, Oleksander Bornyakov, highlighted provisions contained in the legislation to attract “foreign exchange to the Ukrainian market,” adding:

“It will become a powerful incentive for the further development of the crypto-sphere in Ukraine. Banks will open accounts for them and conduct transactions with a new class of assets. I am sure that society, business and the state will benefit from the legalization of the new sector of the economy.”

Asian shares slip as Fed signals ‘downshift’ in economy - KTAR.com,"Shares fell in Asia on Thursday after further losses on Wall Street following a Federal Reserve report showing U.S. economic activity slowed this summer.

The report pointed to resurgent coronavirus cases and mounting supply chain problems and labor shortages — woes affecting many economies. Benchmarks fell in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Sydney.

Japan extended its emergency measures to combat COVID-19 outbreaks until the end of September, as numbers of new cases have been declining only slowly, straining the healthcare system.

Chinese markets have been chilled by further moves by the government to strengthen controls over online businesses that thrived during the pandemic.

On Wednesday, Chinese regulators summoned gaming companies including Tencent Holdings and NetEase Inc. and urged them to protect the physical and mental health of children, state media reported.

In another development, ratings agencies say Evergrande Group, one of China’s biggest real estate developers, looks increasingly likely to default on its debts following news reports it will delay interest payments on bank loans. The company is selling assets to raise cash and faces complaints it is late in paying contractors and in delivering projects to customers.

Ratings agencies Moody’s and Fitch cut their ratings on Evergrande debt this week to a level that indicates they believe the company is likely to default on bond payments due to lack of cash. Chinese authorities are trying to reduce high debt levels in the economy and have urged Evergrande to resolve its more than $300 billion in debt, but financial analysts to suggest they might allow a default while trying to reduce its impact on the financial system.

Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.8% to 29,938.55. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng lost 1.6% to 25,898.67, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher, to 3,611.73. In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 declined 1.8% to 7,377.90. Shares also fell in India and Taiwan.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.33% after rising sharply on Tuesday to 1.37%.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 slipped 0.1% to 4,514.07, its third straight drop. It was roughly split between gainers and losers, but weakness in technology, communication and financial stocks weighed down the market. Less risky investments, including consumer staples and utilities, made broad gains.

Small-company stocks fell more than the broader market. Bond yields were mixed. Oil prices rose.

The Federal Reserve’s latest survey of the nation’s business conditions, dubbed the “Beige Book,” said U.S. economic activity “downshifted” in July and August.

The Fed said the slowdown was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel and tourism in most parts of the country, reflecting concerns about the spread of the highly contagious delta variant.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% to 35,031.07 and the Nasdaq composite slid 0.6% to 2,249.73. The tech-heavy index’s decline ended a four-day winning streak.

The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies lost 1.1%, to 2,249.73.

Investors could be in for a choppy market through September as they monitor the Federal Reserve and Washington, which has to deal with budget reconciliation, infrastructure spending and the debt ceiling.

On the bright side, U.S. employers posted record job openings for the second consecutive month in July, according to the Labor Department. The disconnect between the growing number of job openings and the weak recovery for employment levels suggests the jobs issue could be crimping the broader economic recovery.

The latest Beige Book will be used by Fed policymakers at their next meeting on Sept. 21-22 to help them decide how to move interest rates and whether to end the $120 billion monthly bond purchases the central bank has been making since the pandemic started, to help lower long-term interest rates.

Also Wednesday, shares of cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase fell 3.2% after the company disclosed it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission over its plans to offer its cryptocurrency holders a chance to earn interest on their assets if they lend them out. The company said the regulator has threatened to take civil enforcement action, and the launch of the lending program has been delayed until at least October.

In other trading, benchmark U.S. crude oil shed 5 cents to $69.25 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gained 95 cents on Wednesday, to $69.30 per barrel.

Brent crude, the international benchmark for pricing, picked up 3 cents to $72.63 per barrel.

The U.S. dollar slipped to 110.16 Japanese yen from 110.25 yen. The euro fell to $1.1816 from $1.1818.

MicroStrategy Executives Sold Stock After Bitcoin's Swoon – The Madison Leader Gazette - The Madison Leader Gazette,"(Bloomberg) — Perhaps some MicroStrategy Inc. insiders aren’t quite as sure about tying the company’s long-term fortunes to Bitcoin as their Chief Executive Michael Saylor.

As Bitcoin was recovering from its summer swoon, two of Saylor’s top lieutenants — Chief Financial Officer Le Phong and Chief Technology Officer Timothy Lang unloaded stock in August after exercising about 30% of the options they were awarded. Each realized cool gains of around $7 million from the sales. Saylor, one of the digital currency’s most vocal proselytizers, hasn’t sold any shares, SEC filings show.

While converting options is not unusual for executives, whose grants are considered part of their compensation, the sales follow Saylor’s decision to add more than $2 billion of Bitcoin to the enterprise software maker’s balance sheet and making the purchases an official corporate strategy.

MicroStrategy representatives didn’t reply to requests for comment on last month’s transactions.

After dropping below $30,000 in late July, the digital asset appeared to be poised to make another run at its all-time high of about $65,000 before being beset with more volatility this week.

Shares in the company have surged almost fivefold in the past year, mirroring the gains in Bitcoin, as many investors effectively bought the shares to gain exposure to the largest cryptocurrency at a discount.

Insider selling is common in the aftermath of quarterly earnings reports. But some on Wall Street, such as Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., raised questions on whether the maneuver indicated company officials are concerned that Saylor is taking his eye off the ball when it comes to the core business.

“Senior executives do not sell stock if they think it’s going higher,” said Maley. “It’s just a bad sign no matter how you slice it.”

Lang exercised 10,000 of awarded options on Aug. 26 and subsequently sold all the converted shares, receiving approximately $7.10 million. Phong exercised 20,000 options Aug. 2 through Aug. 6, sold all the shares and received a little over $7.30 million. Both retain about 20,000 options.

Story continues

In 2020, the company’s compensation committee didn’t grant stock option awards to executive officers holding outstanding options that had been given in prior years. Saylor received the option to purchase 400,000 shares in 2014.

Many publicly traded companies establish trading plans for the selling of stock. MicroStrategy’s Form-4 and Form-144 filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission didn’t note the sales were pre-arranged or pursuant to a plan.

Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp., said he doesn’t see the insider selling as something that will faze long-term cryptocurrency bulls.

“MicroStrategy’s Saylor relentless support for Bitcoin has made the company a cryptocurrency trade and not necessarily a bet on the company’s software solutions and services,” said Moya. “The share price will likely continue to go the direction of Saylor and his bet on Bitcoin.”

Shares of MicroStategy dropped 1.5% to $638.62 as of 4:30 p.m. in New York, while Bitcoin fell 1.7% to $46,024.

Blockstream Partners With Macquarie Group to Unveil Bitcoin Mining Pilot Program - CoinTrust,"Blockstream Partners With Macquarie Group to Unveil Bitcoin Mining Pilot Program September 9, 2021

Blockstream Partners With Macquarie Group to Unveil Bitcoin Mining Pilot Program

Blockstream, a blockchain backbone provider, has teamed up with Macquarie Group, an Australian international investment institution, to establish a unique trial for a Bitcoin (BTC) mining center with a mission to investigate carbon-neutral options.

Macquarie Group will participate in one of Blockstream’s enterprise-grade mining operations as portion of the trial venture, the firms said on Wednesday. This will enable Macquarie Group to identify new renewable energy possibilities that can be leveraged for further ecologically friendly Bitcoin mining projects.

With 44 gigawatts of capacity being established as of March 31, 2021, Macquarie Group is one of the biggest institutional investors in renewable energy assets. After successfully collecting $210 million in Series B funding, Blockstream has expanded its goals in the Bitcoin mining sector.

In parallel to the fruitful fundraising, the business announced the acquisition of the intellectual property of Spondoolies, a Bitcoin mining gear maker. As a consequence, the Spondoolies core team became a part of Blockstream’s recently established ASIC unit.

Significantly, Blockstream’s growing emphasis on Bitcoin mining drew a large investment from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who pledged $5 million toward a solar-powered mining center. Bitcoin mining gained significant public attention in 2021 year when Tesla CEO Elon Musk seemed to denounce the cryptocurrency amid worries that its ecosystem was unfeasible from an environmental standpoint.

Soon after, a public discussion over sustainably generated Bitcoin erupted, with industry advocate Michael Saylor hosting an industry organization made up of BTC miners. Musk seems to have moderated his position on the detrimental environmental consequences of miners, even going even further to reveal that SpaceX, another business he runs, has Bitcoin on its books.

The hashrate on the Bitcoin system seems to be increasing again after the sector was severely disrupted earlier this year by China, which essentially outlawed BTC miners.",https://www.cointrust.com/market-news/blockstream-partners-with-macquarie-group-to-unveil-bitcoin-mining-pilot-program,2021-09-09,CoinTrust,https://www.cointrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blockstream.jpg,none
