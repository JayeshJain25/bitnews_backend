El Salvador leads the world into cryptocurrency: bitcoin legal tender - Yahoo Finance,"By Anthony Esposito and Nelson Renteria

SAN SALVADOR, Sept 7 (Reuters) - El Salvador on Tuesday became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, a real-world experiment proponents say will lower commission costs for billions of dollars sent home from abroad but which critics warned may fuel money laundering.

The plan spearheaded by the young, charismatic and popular President Nayib Bukele is aimed at allowing Salvadorans to save on $400 million spent annually in commissions for remittances, mostly sent from the United States.

Last year alone remittances to El Salvador amounted to almost $6 billion, or 23% of its gross domestic product, one of the highest ratios in the world.

Polls show Salvadorans are skeptical about using bitcoin and wary of the volatility of the cryptocurrency that critics say could increase regulatory and financial risks for financial institutions. Still, some residents are optimistic.

""It's going to be beneficial ... we have family in the United States and they can send money at no cost, whereas banks charge to send money from the United States to El Salvador,"" said Reina Isabel Aguilar, a store owner in El Zonte Beach, some 49 km (30 mi) southwest of capital San Salvador.

El Zonte is part of the so-called Bitcoin Beach geared toward making the town one of the world's first bitcoin economies.

In the run-up to the launch, the government has already been installing ATMs of its Chivo digital wallet that will allow the cryptocurrency to be converted into dollars and withdrawn without commission, but Bukele on Monday looked to temper expectations for quick results and asked for patience.

""Like all innovations, El Salvador's bitcoin process has a learning curve. Every road to the future is like this and not everything will be achieved in a day, or in a month,"" Bukele said on Twitter, a platform he often uses to talk up his achievements or excoriate opponents.

On Monday, El Salvador bought its first 400 of the cyrptocurrency, temporarily pushing prices for bitcoin 1.49% higher to more than $52,680. The cryptocurrency has been notoriously volatile. Just this spring, it rose over $64,000 in April and fell almost as low as $30,000 in May.

Some analysts fear the move to make bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar could muddy the outlook for El Salvador's quest to seek a more than $1 billion financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

After Bukele's bitcoin law was approved, rating agency Moody's downgraded El Salvador's creditworthiness, while the country's dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.

But Bukele, who does not shy away from controversy, on Monday retweeted a video that showed face superimposed on actor Jaime Foxx in a scene from Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino's film about American slavery. The video portrayed Bukele whipping a slave trader who had the IMF emblem emblazoned on his face.

Bukele later deleted the retweet.

His own tweet said: ""we must break the paradigms of the past. El Salvador has the right to advance towards the first world.""

"The disastrous voyage of Satoshi, the world's first cryptocurrency cruise ship - The Guardian","On the evening of 7 December 2010, in a hushed San Francisco auditorium, former Google engineer Patri Friedman sketched out the future of humanity. The event was hosted by the Thiel Foundation, established four years earlier by the arch-libertarian PayPal founder Peter Thiel to “defend and promote freedom in all its dimensions”. From behind a large lectern, Friedman – grandson of Milton Friedman, one of the most influential free-market economists of the last century – laid out his plan. He wanted to transform how and where we live, to abandon life on land and all our decrepit assumptions about the nature of society. He wanted, quite simply, to start a new city in the middle of the ocean.

Friedman called it seasteading: “Homesteading the high seas,” a phrase borrowed from Wayne Gramlich, a software engineer with whom he’d founded the Seasteading Institute in 2008, helped by a $500,000 donation from Thiel. In a four-minute vision-dump, Friedman explained his rationale. Why, he asked, in one of the most advanced countries in the world, were they still using systems of government from 1787? (“If you drove a car from 1787, it would be a horse,” he pointed out.) Government, he believed, needed an upgrade, like a software update for a phone. “Let’s think of government as an industry, where countries are firms and citizens are customers!” he declared.

The difficulty in starting a new form of government, said Friedman, was simply a lack of space. All the land on Earth was taken. What they needed was a new frontier, and that frontier was the ocean. “Let a thousand nations bloom on the high seas,” he proclaimed, with Maoish zeal. He wanted seasteading experiments to start as soon as possible. Within three to six years, he imagined ships being repurposed as floating medical clinics. Within 10 years, he predicted, small communities would be permanently based on platforms out at sea. In a few decades, he hoped there would be floating cities “with millions of people pioneering different ways of living together”.

Politics would be rewritten. The beauty of seasteading was that it offered its inhabitants total freedom and choice. In 2017, Friedman and the “seavangelist” Joe Quirk wrote a book, Seasteading, in which they described how a seasteading community could constantly rearrange itself according to the choices of those who owned the individual floating units. (Quirk now runs the Seasteading Institute; Friedman remains chair of the board.) “Democracy,” the two men wrote, “would be upgraded to a system whereby the smallest minorities, including the individual, could vote with their houses.”

In the decade following Friedman’s talk, a variety of attempts to realise his seasteading vision were all thwarted. “Seavilization,” to use his phrase, remained a fantasy. Then, in October 2020, it seemed his dream might finally come true, when three seasteading enthusiasts bought a 245-metre-long cruise ship called the Pacific Dawn. Grant Romundt, Rüdiger Koch and Chad Elwartowski planned to sail the ship to Panama, where they were based, and park it permanently off the coastline as the centrepiece of a new society trading only in cryptocurrencies. In homage to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of bitcoin’s mysterious inventor (or inventors), they renamed the ship the MS Satoshi. They hoped it would become home to people just like them: digital nomads, startup founders and early bitcoin adopters.

Their vision was utopian, if your idea of utopia is a floating crypto-community in the Caribbean Sea. No longer was seasteading a futuristic ideal; it was, said Romundt, “an actual ship”. The Satoshi also offered a chance to marry two movements, of crypto-devotees and seasteaders, united by their desire for freedom – from convention, regulation, tax. Freedom from the state in all its forms. But converting a cruise ship into a new society proved more challenging than envisaged. The high seas, while appearing borderless and free, are, in fact, some of the most tightly regulated places on Earth. The cruise ship industry in particular is bound by intricate rules. As Romundt put it: “We were like, ‘This is just so hard.’”

As with many stories about techno-libertarian fantasies, the tale of the Satoshi begins in an all-male, quasi-frat house in San Francisco in the late 90s. Romundt – a softly spoken Canadian with the optimistic, healthy glow of someone who combines entrepreneurial success with water sports – was living with a bunch of software engineers, all of whom shared an intense dedication to personal improvement. “I was a huge Tony Robbins fan,” Romundt told me in one of several Zoom calls from his office in Panama. (Robbins’ themes of individual freedom, self-mastery and the accrual of significant wealth are evident from the titles of his books from that time: Unlimited Power; Lessons in Mastery; Unleash the Power Within; The Power to Shape Your Destiny, and, next level, Awaken the Giant Within.)

After his San Francisco stint, Romundt, the son of a hairdresser, created ScissorBoy in 2009, a popular online TV series on hairdressing, and then ScheduleBox, a website which offered a digital receptionist service for hairstylists to book in their clients. (Always digitally inclined, he had, according to his website, the world’s “most advanced mobile paperless office in 1995”.) “I used to work 17 hours a day, so I didn’t have a lot of freedom,” he told me. He did, however, make enough money to semi-retire in 2016 and then spent “no more than five hours a month” running his business. The giant fully awakened, he moved back to Canada, where he lived on a houseboat on Lake Ontario and went kayaking in the mornings as the sun came up. Enraptured by his lifestyle, Romundt wondered why everyone wasn’t living this way. On a flight one day, he saw a man wearing a T-shirt with “Stop arguing. Start seasteading” printed on it. Romundt was curious, they got talking, and the man turned out to be Joe Quirk, who was by this time running the Seasteading Institute.

So far, the Seasteading Institute had experienced variable, or zero, success with its projects. Early ideas for a “Baystead” and “Coaststead” off the coast of San Francisco and a “Clubstead”, a resort off the coast of California, never made the leap to reality. An attempt to create a floating island prototype in French Polynesia in 2017 met with fairly fierce resistance from the people of French Polynesia and collapsed a year later when the government pulled out of the scheme.

After meeting Quirk, Romundt decided he wanted to try again. Quirk introduced him to two other aspiring seasteaders, the passionately libertarian American Elwartowski and the bitcoin-wealthy German engineer Koch. Together, the trio founded a company, Ocean Builders. Using their own money, they funded the first attempt at a single residential seastead, in the form of a floating white octagonal box 12 nautical miles off the coast of Thailand. Elwartowski and his girlfriend, Nadia Summergirl, lived there for two months in early 2018, until the Thai government discovered the seastead’s existence and declared it a threat to the country’s independence, possibly punishable by life imprisonment or death. Elwartowski and Summergirl had to flee the country before the Thai navy dispatched three ships to dismantle the floating box.

The seasteading movement did not die there. In 2019, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski moved their company to Panama, where they had found a government willing to back their next project: the SeaPod. These would be individual floating homes held 3 metres above the water by a single column and a tripod-shaped base beneath the ocean. The man responsible for their design, Koen Olthuis, is a Dutch “aquatect”, an architect specialising in water-based schemes. In rendered drawings, the SeaPods look fantastical, like a giant’s white helmet emerging monstrously from the waves. Inside, every surface is curved, as if you were living within the smooth, colourless confines of a peppermint. Romundt compared the SeaPods to the architecture in The Jetsons, the 60s cartoon where the characters lived in glassy orbs in the sky. “It’s like that,” he told me, “but on water.” The team built a factory from scratch in Linton Bay, a marina on the north coast of Panama, hired a team of about 30 engineers and mechanics, and, in early 2020, began building the first SeaPod prototype.

Progress was slow. Even once they had a successful prototype, Romundt predicted the factory would only make two SeaPods a month. They’d had the idea before of buying a cruise ship – a quick way of scaling up the community – but the cost had always been prohibitive. By autumn 2020, though, the situation had changed. Like many parts of the travel industry, the cruise ship business was collapsing because of the pandemic: multiple cruise lines were going into administration, empty ships filling up ports like abandoned cars in a scrubby field, or being sent to the scrapyard. Cruise ships, the Ocean Builders trio realised, would be going cheap.

Sure enough, they found a bargain. In October 2020, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski bought the ex-P&O cruise ship Pacific Dawn for a reported $9.5m. (Built in 1991 for $280m, the ship could have sold pre-pandemic for more than $100m, one industry insider told me.) They instructed Olthuis to draw up the plans, placing the ship at the heart of a floating community surrounded by SeaPods. “We had a kind of funny idea,” Olthuis told me. In his scheme, the Satoshi would connect, via two looping tunnels on the water, to human-made floating platforms designated for agriculture, manufacturing and parkland. From the air, the whole community would form the shape of the bitcoin B.

The scheme had the support of the Panama government. In fact, the Ministry of Tourism hoped that a new ocean community would be a draw for visitors. In a page-long statement, the ministry told me how a floating development fitted in with its Sustainable Tourism Masterplan 2020-2025, by highlighting the country’s biodiversity and “the blue heritage of Panama”. It didn’t seem to mind the idea of a load of crypto-investors floating off their coastline, not paying any tax.

“Out of adversity comes opportunity, so they say,” wrote Elwartowski, on 10 October 2020, introducing Viva Vivas, the new company that he had created to run the Satoshi. Its name was adapted from the Latin phrase, “vive ut vivas”, meaning “live so that you may live”.

Ten days later, he announced the venture on Reddit: “So, I am buying a cruise ship and naming it MS Satoshi … AMA.” The responses were quick (“Need an apprentice aviation mechanic?” “I know how to use a yo-yo! Any room for me??”) and included the inevitable sceptics. (“Anyone remember the good old days of the Fyre festival?”) But plenty took the proposition seriously and wanted to go over the small print. (“Where is power coming from? Gas? Internet? Food? Water? Toiletries? What taxes will she be subject to?”)

Elwartowski answered every question with grave attention to detail. There would be generators at first, followed quickly by solar power. This would be an eco-friendly crypto-ship. High-speed wireless internet would come from land; utilities would be included in the fees at first, but would be metered when the systems were upgraded: “You don’t want to have pay for someone else’s mining rig in their cabin,” he wrote, referring to the resource-intensive computational process that introduces new crypto “coins” into the system. As for tax, you would not pay any on earnings made from ventures based in territory beyond Panama. You would be free to make, or mine, as much money as you liked. It would be a remote worker’s regulatory paradise.

But as the Reddit Q&A continued, Elwartowski’s meticulous responses revealed some of the more knotty practicalities of life on board. It turned out that the only cooking facilities would be in the restaurant. For safety reasons, no one was allowed to have a microwave in their rooms – though some cabins had mini-fridges, noted Elwartowski, determinedly sidestepping the point. He offered residents a 20% discount at the restaurant and mentioned that some interested cruisers had already talked about renting part of the restaurant kitchen so they could make their own food. “We want entrepreneurs to come up with solutions and try them out,” he wrote, in a valiant attempt to convert a fairly fundamental stumbling block into wild startup energy. “This is your place to try new things.” Not all the Redditors were convinced. “No microwave but mining rig. Incoherent scam.”

Marketing of the Satoshi soon began in earnest. Her 777 cabins were to be auctioned off between 5 and 28 November, while the ship was crossing the Atlantic towards Panama. Viva Vivas listed the options, including cabins with no windows ($570 a month), an ocean view ($629), or a balcony ($719). Ocean Builders held a series of live video calls for potential customers which attracted 200 people at a time, Olthuis told me, with Romundt, an expert steward of the multilateral video call, at the helm.

On the Viva Vivas website, a Frequently Asked Questions page covered the basics of the cabin auction process, fees and logistics. Specially trained staff would be hired to keep the ship Covid-free and through a partnership with a platform called coinpayments.net, multiple cryptocurrencies would be supported for payment, including bitcoin, ethereum, digibyte, bitcoin cash, litecoin, dai, dash, ethereum classic, trueUSD, USD coin, tether, bitcoin SV, electroneum, cloak, doge, eureka coin, xem and monero.

The final entry on the FAQ page, regarding the possibility of having pets on board, gave a bracing insight into the tension between the idea of freedom and the reality of hundreds of people closely cohabiting on a cruise ship. The answer linked to a separate document, containing a 14-point list of conditions including one that declared no animal should exceed 20lbs in weight, and any barking or loud noises could not last for longer than 10 minutes. If a pet repeatedly disturbed the peace – more than three times a month or five times in a year – it would no longer be allowed to live on board. “Any pet related conflict,” instructed point 13, “shall be resolved in accordance with Section V (F) of the Satoshi Purchase Agreement or Section IV (F) of the Satoshi Master Lease, where applicable.” Dogs would only be permitted in balcony cabins, and it was advised that owners buy a specific brand of “porch potty”, a basket of fake grass where your pet could relieve itself. (Pet waste thrown overboard would result in a $200 fine.)

One Reddit respondent – maxcoiner on Reddit, Luke Parker in real life – was as close to the target market of the Satoshi as it was possible to imagine. A longtime follower of the seasteading movement, he was also such an early and successful bitcoin adopter that he and his wife were able to retire early thanks to their investments. The Satoshi was the most plausible idea for a seastead he’d ever heard. “I did not buy a room during the Satoshi’s sale window,” he told me over email, “but it was hard to keep my hand off that button.”

A variety of considerations held him back. “The wife,” as he put it, had her doubts. He wasn’t sure about the “ginormous leap down in luxury” from living in deep residential comfort on land in the US midwest to living in a very small cabin on board a 30-year-old cruise ship. He was worried, too, by the limited facilities – “No kitchen of my own? Tiny bathrooms? Tiny everything?” Also, the constant rocking of the ship on the water: “I just can’t stomach that life around the clock.” He preferred the idea of the SeaPods. If Parker was going to live on a boat, he concluded, he’d prefer to buy his own luxury catamaran.

On 29 November, Elwartowski published another post on the Viva Vivas website, announcing the official opening of the Satoshi in January 2021. “This will be a new experience for all of us so we must manage your expectations,” he warned. The novelty was too much for Parker. “It takes a rare kind of person indeed to move your life on to a deserted cruise ship in Central America with so little information up front,” he told me. If Parker, part of that highly select, freedom-seeking, system-abandoning, overlapping community of seasteaders and bitcoiners, wasn’t going to buy, it was hard to imagine who would. As he put it: “This may have been the smallest sales demographic in history.”

Over 30 years of service, the Satoshi herself had seen enough of the world to know every permutation of life at sea – apart, perhaps from what it might be like to be a permanent home to 2,000 crypto-investors. Built in 1991 in the Fincantieri shipyard in Trieste, Italy, she is one of only two cruise ships designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. (The other, the Crown Princess, was sent to the scrapyard last year, a Covid casualty.) Her first incarnation was as the Regal Princess (owned by Princess Cruises), after which she became the Pacific Dawn (P&O Australia). Throughout her life, she has been admired for her distinctive features: a domed roof rising above the navigation bridge, water slides that curl round her funnel and a stern whose elegantly rounded form is in marked contrast to the blunt, sawn-off rears of some giant cruise liners. Those who prefer an understated cruising experience also appreciate her discreet size: compared to the largest cruise ship in the world, The Symphony of the Seas (18 decks, 23 swimming pools) she is a modest vessel (11 decks, two swimming pools).

For many years, the Pacific Dawn cruised the south Pacific, enjoying a serene phase of life, interrupted only by an onboard swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the time she lost power and came within 70 metres of crashing into the Gateway Bridge on the Brisbane River. In 2011, a devoted Facebook group was established by fans. “Dawnie was the party ship,” remembered one. “I fell in love with my wife all over again,” added another, crediting the ship for his romantic renewal. Then, in 2020, it briefly looked as though Dawnie was set to join her sister on the scrapyard, after her sale to British cruise company, Cruise and Maritime Voyages, collapsed in the pandemic. Her fans were grief-stricken, weeping emojis piling up on the Facebook group. (“Well 2020 just became even shittier,” said Kathie.) When it was revealed that the ship had been rescued by Ocean Builders, there was a wave of relief, if a little mystification at her new name. “She’ll always be Dawn to me.”

On 29 October 2020, Dawn began her journey to Panama, sailing from Limassol, Cyprus to Piraeus, Greece. A week later, she was handed over to her new owners Ocean Builders and officially became the Satoshi. Koch flew over from Panama to cross the Atlantic aboard their new purchase. The team hired a management company, Columbia Cruise Services, to run the ship and provide a minimum crew of about 40 people, mostly Ukrainian, including a cook, engineers and cleaning staff. A seasoned British cruise captain, Peter Harris, arrived to take charge. “We didn’t know anything about running a cruise,” Romundt told me, “so it was like, we didn’t want to have to figure all this stuff out.”

As soon as Capt Harris joined the ship and met Koch on board, he realised there would be challenges ahead. “I was thinking a week into the job, I can see I’m going to be resigning,” Harris told me, immaculate in a striped shirt on a video call from his home in Kent. Koch, he said, was admirable in his ambition, and a likable, law-abiding man, but he was naive about how shipping worked and had an abhorrence of rules. “He didn’t understand the industry,” said Harris, who has the frank, upbeat air of a born leader for whom hierarchy is a kind of creed. “He just thought he could treat it like his own yacht.”

To sail anywhere, Harris explained, a ship requires certificates of seaworthiness. These expired on the day the deal with P&O was completed. Usually, a new buyer would ensure they lasted a couple of months to cover any onward journey, but no one on the Ocean Builders side had checked. By the time Columbia Cruise Services came on board and informed the team of the situation, the contracts had all been signed. Before the Satoshi could cross the Atlantic, the team were obliged to sail the ship to Gibraltar and have her removed from the water, a process known as dry-docking, to perform essential repairs and renew the certificates.

The Atlantic crossing began on 3 December. Harris – who didn’t resign, grateful for the four-month contract mid-pandemic – found it oddly lovely. With only 40 or so people on board, rather than the usual 2,000-odd, the atmosphere was relaxed, if a little surreal. Among other things, P&O had left about 5,000 bottles of wine and 2,000 bottles of spirits on board. Harris asked Koch if he wanted to charge the crew for drinks, but Koch, generous by nature, said no. “Obviously, we restricted them to three drinks a day,” said Harris. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had a crew.”

As the crossing continued, questions about how the project would actually work once the Satoshi arrived in Panama grew more pressing. According to Harris, Elwartowski thought he could convince the Panamanian authorities to let the ship anchor permanently in its waters and de-register as a ship, becoming a floating residence instead, so as to avoid some of the more exacting requirements of maritime law. But while Panama was happy to have the ship moored off its coast, it specified that the ship had to remain officially designated as a ship. Which led to another difficulty: the discharge of sewage. Though the ship had an advanced wastewater management system, which could turn sewage into drinking-quality water, they were not permitted to discharge this wastewater into Panamanian waters, and so would have had to sail 12 miles out every 20 days or so to empty tanks into international waters.

Such obstacles made the ship an off-putting proposition for insurers. No one would agree to cover them. “They wouldn’t even tell us why we weren’t insurable, they just kept saying no,” Romundt said. “It’s kind of hard to remedy something if you don’t know what the problem is.” Of the several insurance experts I asked about this, none were willing to comment on the case, citing a lack of expertise, presumably because no one had ever tried to insure a cruise ship turned floating crypto-community before. Harris, however, had his theories: that a risk-averse insurance industry was wary of both a bitcoin business and a ship that would presumably be mostly populated by quick-to-litigate Americans.

After trying multiple insurers and brokers, Romundt began to realise that the cruise ship industry was, as he put it, “plagued by over-regulation”. (Along with airlines and nuclear power, according to Harris, it’s in “the top three”.) The Ocean Builders’ great freedom project, whose intrinsic purpose was to offer an escape from oppressive rules and bureaucracy, was being hobbled by oppressive rules and bureaucracy. As Elwartowski would reflect a few months later on Reddit: “A cruise ship is not very good for people who want to be free.”

To Romundt, the whole cruise ship business began to seem like an impenetrable old boys’ network. He estimated that, given six months, they could have hired a crack marine legal team and navigated a way through the loopholes. But by mid-December, the Satoshi was already halfway across the Atlantic, burning through gallons of diesel, with a 40-person crew they’d have to keep on board even when she was stationary in Panama because a cruise ship requires constant maintenance. A ship can cost, even when docked, up to $1m a month to run. “Because, you know,” said Romundt, “it’s huge.”

Fuel alone was costing the Ocean Builders trio about $12,000 a day. According to Harris, Koch wanted to try to make the ship more fuel-efficient by installing a smaller engine, which he thought he could do while the ship was at anchor. “We were like, how are you going to cut a hole in the ship’s side big enough to get the engine out, which is below water level, and not sink the ship?” Harris shook his head, his memories of Koch clearly fond, if perplexed. “I was forever saying, ‘No, Rudi you can’t do this; no, Rudi you can’t do that.’”

Before the Satoshi hove into view of the white sands of a Panama beach, Romundt, Koch and Elwartowski had to make a call. They couldn’t afford to keep the ship moored and empty for months on end while they tried to solve the insurance problem, a problem they weren’t even sure they’d be able to solve. They were insured to sail her, and they could go on sailing her, but they didn’t want to run a travel company. They wanted to run a floating society of like-minded freedom-lovers arranged in the shape of the bitcoin B. It wasn’t even clear that there were enough people who wanted to do that. Koch admitted to Harris that the cabins weren’t selling.

“It was almost like a fantasy, James Bond-ish,” said one cruise industry insider. “But to their credit they believed in it.”

The dream was over, they realised, before it had even begun. The project was dead, except it wasn’t quite, as they still owned the ship, which was still steaming across the Atlantic with Koch, Harris and the crew on board. The Satoshi, already thousands of miles into a 5,500-nautical-mile voyage, had travelled too far to be turned around mid-ocean, so on she sailed. They’d have to sell her, the Ocean Builders realised, but who was going to be crazy enough to buy a cruise ship in the middle of a pandemic? Only a company who wanted to tear her apart. On 18 December, while she was still at sea, the team announced the sale of the Satoshi to a scrapyard in Alang, India. The Satoshi was once again destined for dismemberment.

On 19 December, Elwartowski announced on the Viva Vivas website that the Satoshi’s journey was coming to an end. “We have lost this round. The New Normal, Great Reset gains another victim,” he wrote, looping in the collapse of the Satoshi with a popular Covid conspiracy theory that the pandemic and its response had been stage-managed by a global elite. (Over subsequent months, Elwartowski’s activity on Reddit would include other Covid themes, including suspicion of government vaccination programmes.) Romundt emailed their list of potential customers to let them know the ship’s fate. Deposits for cabins would be refunded.

The Satoshi arrived in Balboa, Panama on 22 December. On Christmas Eve, she anchored off the coast of Colon. There, Romundt joined Koch and the crew on the ship. Elwartowski, meanwhile, stayed in Panama City. “He didn’t want to get on board,” said Romundt. Koch spoke to Joe Quirk one evening on the phone while he was sitting in the ship’s cafe drinking a bottle of wine, feeling regretful that the onboard hospital he’d planned to open to medical entrepreneurs would never come to life. Even so, Koch was “utterly unbowed”, reported Quirk in a Seasteading Institute blog post entitled How the Grinch Stole the Cruise Ship.

Romundt, a man more driven by the practical issues at hand than the romantic symbolism of his endeavours, realised that, though the entire plan had fallen apart, he was still the part-owner of a massive cruise ship. He decided to spend Christmas on board, along with the crew. Master key in hand, he wandered around the Satoshi, making sure to enter every room that said Do Not Enter. He toured the engine room, and sat on the sun deck. He worked, because he can’t help working, even at Christmas, but he also went on all the water slides, alone. (Harris told me he’d turned them on specially for Christmas Day.) Though Romundt doesn’t usually drink, he had a glass of wine and called all his friends saying, “I’m on my own cruise ship for Christmas!” He had the kind of good time it is perhaps only possible to have when you have just made an unbelievably expensive mistake born of a desire to invent an entirely new way of living and involving the purchase of a huge floating vessel. “I was king of the ship!” he said, still delighted.

Even scrapping the Satoshi proved to be a debacle. After a deal had been done with the Indian scrapyard, the Ocean Builders team realised that according to the Basel Convention, which covers the disposal of hazardous waste, they weren’t allowed to send the ship from a signatory country (Panama) to a non-signatory country (India). The contract with the scrapyard had to be cancelled.

All was not completely lost, at least for the Satoshi herself. The cruise ship industry is a compact ecosystem. The grapevine did its thing. A ship broker heard about the plight of the Satoshi, realised it was precisely the kind of ship a new client of his was looking for, and did a quick deal.

The client was Ambassador, the first British cruise line to launch for 10 years. According to Ambassador’s ebullient, red-sweatered chair, Gordon Wilson, the company’s name is intended to reflect the highly optimistic idea that ambassadors, like cruise ships, take the best of their own culture with them wherever they go. The Satoshi would be the first ship in the company’s new fleet, which would offer cruises to the over-50s. Many of the new team at Ambassador had come over from Cruise and Maritime Voyages, who had nearly bought the Satoshi before it went bust in 2020. As such, they knew the ship well, which sped up the sale. Wilson wouldn’t confirm the amount – “they thought it was a good price” – but the trade press reported that Ocean Builders sold her for $12m, more than they paid for her, though possibly not quite enough to cover the elaborate costs of running an empty cruise ship for three months.

On 23 February 2021, the Satoshi set sail from Panama, heading all the way back across the ocean she’d just crossed. She arrived in Bar, Montenegro on 27 March. Wilson went over to visit her, and, like Romundt, relished the experience of climbing aboard his new asset. Exploring the engine rooms of an empty cruise ship seemed to give these men a particular sensation: perhaps just the buzz of owning something so vast and powerful; a mechanical, proprietary thrill.

The Ocean Builders team, meanwhile, returned to their own private missions. Elwartowski was on sabbatical, Romundt told me. He did not want to talk to me for this story. Koch, who also declined to be interviewed, was building his own boat in Panama, and working with Romundt on the SeaPods. Over Zoom, Romundt gave me a tour of the SeaPod factory, and showed off the hulking sheets of fibreglass that would form the structure’s mould. “It feels like touching a UFO,” he said, stroking his invention.

Seeing the pod’s nascent form, I felt a boringly pragmatic urge to ask Romundt what happened if, once afloat, you needed to buy a pint of milk. My question seemed to miss the point, too wedded to old-fashioned notions of locality and human connection. The Pods had been designed to have a hatch in the roof, Romundt said. He was talking to some drone creators and imagined people flying to their pods independently, landing on the roof and entering through the hatch. Perhaps that’s how you’d get your milk.

At her new home in Montenegro, meanwhile, the Satoshi needed some sprucing up. For the fourth time in her three decades on the water, she had been renamed. “We thought Ambience a lovely name for a ship,” said Wilson, pronouncing it in the French style, Ambi-ence. “This is a very elegant ship,” he added, proudly. “She looks like a cruise liner; she does not look like a floating block of flats.”

When Ambience finally sets sail on her maiden voyage, from the industrial dock of Tilbury across the North Sea to Hamburg in April 2022, she will offer a more traditional experience to her passengers. “Back to what cruising is all about,” said Wilson. The atmosphere will be refined. There will be promenading on deck and plentiful opportunities for photography as the horizon swallows the evening sun. There will be cocktails at the bar, a three-course dinner and a glittery show. It is unlikely bitcoin will be accepted as currency.

Visa Plans to Bring Cryptocurrency Services to Traditional Banks in Brazil – Bitcoin News - Bitcoin News,"Visa Plans to Bring Cryptocurrency Services to Traditional Banks in Brazil

Visa, the multinational payments giant, has announced it is planning to bring cryptocurrency services to traditional banking platforms in Brazil. The company also announced that it is working with several cryptocurrency companies in the country to bring cryptocurrency payment cards to the market and hinted at a possible direct integration of bitcoin in payments.

Visa Gears Up for Crypto Integration in Brazil

Credit card giant Visa has announced it plans to integrate cryptocurrency solutions into traditional banking platforms. Eduardo Abreu, Visa’s vice president of new business in Brazil, stated the company has plans to develop applications (APIs) to unite traditional banks with cryptographic products. In this way, it would be possible to make investments in cryptocurrencies and ETFs within banking platforms with no intermediates.

Visa also announced it is working with several national companies to issue cryptocurrency cards. Among these are Zro Bank, Alterbank, and Rippio, which will allow users to connect these to bank accounts. The Visa executive did not comment on a possible ETA for these developments.

B2B Developments, Direct Bitcoin Payments, and NFTs

Visa revealed that they are also working on a B2B (business-to-business) oriented blockchain that will allow payment settlement among companies using smart contracts. Abreu stated that the system was already in testing phases with some of their customers, and that the company would have more announcements in this regard in the future. This system would enhance transparency in payments among providers and suppliers, allowing everyone with access to the system to verify payments and deposits.

Visa also stated they will start testing direct bitcoin payments in the country. This means that transactions will allow bitcoin to be transferred to other accounts directly. This is completely different than what happens now with most crypto cards, where there has to be an intermediary that exchanges bitcoin for fiat money on the fly.

The inclusion of direct bitcoin payments will facilitate the payment process and eliminate these intermediaries. In March, the CEO of Visa in Brazil stated it expects to implement this functionality sometime this year. Abreu stated there was also an NFT initiative in the works for Brazil. Visa has already jumped onto the NFT bandwagon by purchasing a Cryptopunk, a digital avatar on the Ethereum network, for $165K in ether, in August.

Core Title Services facilitates cryptocurrency deals : NYREJ - New York Real Estate Journal Online,"Lake Success, NY Core Title Services can now accept Bitcoin and select other cryptocurrencies for commercial and residential real estate purchases.

The firm has engaged BitPay, one of the largest providers of cryptocurrency payment services in the world, to ensure the process is compliant, secure and easy for customers. For Core Title Services, BitPay will convert the buyer’s digital assets into U.S. dollars, which is then sent to the title company and the seller if they choose. Very few title companies nationwide have worked to be set up for this kind of capability.

“As a forward-thinking group, we’re thrilled to be among the first title companies in our area to be able to do this for buyers and sellers,” said Andrew Zankel, the president of Core Title Services. “It’s an exciting time because cryptocurrency will certainly be part of the future, and we want to be part of that for our customers. While BitPay is the first company we are working with, we have already started discussions with other platforms to offer a full suite of compliant blockchain based solutions.”

Zankel and his team are licensed to insure residential and commercial transactions across the state of New York. Zankel noted there are some New York City developers and sellers who advertise real estate prices in Bitcoin and pointed to the fact that cryptocurrency is a preferred asset for many Millennial and Gen-Z investors. Many of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin, who profited most during the recent boom, are now searching for ways to diversify their holdings.

While it has been much publicized how much the value of Bitcoin has exploded over the last decade – a single coin was worth more than $60,000 briefly in April – interest in investing in various forms of cryptocurrency has spiked over the last couple of years.

“There are a lot of tech-savvy people out there who have a sizable portion of their net worth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Zankel said. “As they look to purchase homes or add to their real estate portfolio, the ability to pay for property in digital assets is a logical request, and we can make that happen for them.”

Zankel, who is a member of the Real Estate Working Group of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance and is the chair of the Technology Committee for the New York State Land Title Association, has been keeping tabs on how cryptocurrency and blockchain could affect real estate for years. He has no expectations in terms of when his company will do its first crypto transaction – or how frequently the service may be utilized. However, he views this offering as a natural step for a company that values being on the cutting edge.

“I’m a believer in Blockchain technology and think crypto can open up a lot of doors as long as those efforts are compliant and done properly, which is what we’re doing,” Zankel said. “Our team is always working to connect the traditional real estate marketplace with innovative ways of doing things. This is just one more way we can carry out that mission every day.”

"CrossTower, a Global Cryptocurrency Exchange, Enters India Despite Policy Uncertainty - Gadgets 360","US-headquartered digital currency exchange CrossTower has set up a local unit in India and launched a trading platform to capture the growing domestic crypto market even though the fate of cryptocurrency in India is still unclear.

CrossTower India has already hired 35 people and plans to increase headcount to 100 in six to nine months, the company said. The company is following in the footsteps of market leader Binance, which entered India in 2019.

India's digital currency market has grown from $923 million (roughly Rs. 6,750 crores) in April 2020 to $6.6 billion (roughly Rs. 48,300 crores) in May 2021, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform. Among 154 nations, India ranks 11th in cryptocurrency adoption, it said.

""India will play a pivotal role and we plan to use the country as a hub to expand into other geographies,"" Kapil Rathi, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of CrossTower, told Reuters.

As a late entrant to India, the company plans to increase its market share by providing competitive pricing and relying on advanced technology infrastructure, Rathi added.

Several other global exchanges are considering coming to India despite the lack of regulations on crypto and concerns about an unfavourable regulatory environment.

""We believe we are taking a calculated risk,"" said Rathi.

The government was set to present a bill to parliament by March that proposed a ban on cryptocurrencies, making trading and holding them illegal. But the bill was not tabled in the session and there is uncertainty about the government's plans.

The central bank is planning to launch its own digital currency by December, however.

Why 'Bitcoin Day' Is Trending On Twitter Today - Benzinga - Benzinga,"“Bitcoin Day” was seen trending on Twitter on Monday after El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele revealed that the country purchased its first 200 bitcoins (CRYPTO: BTC).

What Happened: Bukele tweeted twice on Monday, first to say that El Salvador had purchased its first batch of BTC and then later to update that the country now held 400 BTC worth nearly $21 million.

El Salvador just bought 200 new coins. We now hold 400 #bitcoin#BitcoinDay — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) September 6, 2021

Both tweets carried the hashtag “BitcoinDay.” The President’s use of the hashtag came a day ahead of El Salvador adopting the apex cryptocurrency as legal tender.

Several notables from the cryptocurrency Twitter reacted to the El Salvadorian leader’s post shortly.

Great job. — David Gokhshtein (@davidgokhshtein) September 6, 2021

Popular Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) YouTuber Matt Wallace had his own take on Dogecoin Day.

Why It Matters: On Monday, Bitcoin ran past the $52,000 mark as El Salvador prepped to make it legal tender. This caused the cryptocurrency’s relative strength index to reach about 72%.

Benzinga’s Melanie Schaffer noted that when a “stock or cryptocurrency’s RSI measures in at over 70%, it is in oversold territory, which is a sell signal for technical traders.”

However, the low trading volume on the pull-back is a sign of consolidation rather than selling pressure, which means most BTC holders are sticking with their coins currently.

In June, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin after the country’s Congress voted with a supermajority of 62 out of 84 in favor of a bill that established the apex coin as legal tender.

However, a poll by El Salvador’s Central American University indicated this month that a majority of the people disagree or strongly disagree with the use of Bitcoin as legal tender.

The International Monetary Fund criticized El Salvador’s adoption of BTC calling it an “inadvisable shortcut” to creating a digital currency of its own.

Price Action: At press time, BTC traded 1.7% higher at $52,596.77 over 24 hours.

Kim Kardashian Gets Called Out By Regulator For Promoting Ethereum Knock-Off To Instagram Followers - Ben - Benzinga,"Kim Kardashian asked her followers to “speculate” on Ethereum Max (CRYPTO: EMAX), which according to the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority Chair Charles Randell may have been the “financial promotion with the single biggest audience reach in history,” BBC reported.

What Happened: Randell, speaking at the Cambridge International Symposium on Economic Crime, said that Kardashian had “asked her 250 million followers to speculate on crypto tokens” by promoting EMAX.

The FCA Chair alluded to Kardashian’s Instagram post made in June, which he claimed was correctly flagged as an advertisement. The regulator accused influencers of fueling “delusions of quick riches.”

“Social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation. Some influencers promote coins that turn out simply not to exist at all,” said Randell, as per BBC.

Why It Matters: Kardashian’s June post came in the form of an Instagram story that was bundled with a disclaimer.

She wrote, “Are you guys into crypto???? This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends just told me about the Ethereum Max token!”

The popular reality television star included the hashtag AD, which stands for advertisement, in the Instagram story.

EMAX has also been promoted through a boxing match between the YouTuber Logan Paul and boxing legend Floyd Mayweather.

Others that have promoted the coin include former National Basketball Association player Paul Pierce.

Randell noted that 2.3 million Britons hold cryptocurrency and 14% of them used credit to purchase the coins — ""thereby increasing the exposure to loss,” reported BBC.

""If you buy them, you should be prepared to lose all your money,"" said the FCA Chair.

On EMAX, Randell said he could say if it was a scam, but he did stress the coin was not be confused with Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), as per the BBC.

Price Action: At press time, EMAX traded 0.79% higher at $0.000000028 over 24 hours. ETH traded 0.14% higher at $3,932.06 in the same period.

Nigeria: Why Crypto Is Booming in Nigeria Despite Govt Ban - AllAfrica.com,"Global peer-to-peer crypto exchange Remitano is currently developing its native token, RENEC, to improve the quality of services delivered to customers, reduce transaction fees and ensure secure and swift transactions.

It is no news that crypto is a big deal in Nigeria. Nigeria is one of the leading countries in the world when it comes to crypto adoption. A lot of people don't want to miss out on the opportunities that cryptocurrency offers. This makes the number of people looking to buy bitcoin in Nigeria very high. The adoption keeps growing day by day despite the ambiguous legal status of digital assets in the country.

Nigeria doesn't have a law that governs cryptocurrency yet, however, earlier this year, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) released a statement that appeared to be a ban on the use of bitcoin as well as other digital assets in the country. While this was perceived by many to be the beginning of the end of crypto in Nigeria, the situation however took another turn as crypto continues to bloom and flourish in the country. The ban has had little to no effect on cryptocurrency usage in the country as many have adjusted to the current situation, crypto users have found new ways to buy BTC in Nigeria and continue their crypto trades.

Before going into why crypto continues to boom in Nigeria even with the ban, let's look at the details of the crypto ban in the country. Read about blockchain technology and the RENEC blockchain.

Crypto ban in Nigeria

On February 5, the CBN released a ruling that orders all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions and desist from transacting with entities engaging in crypto. The statement also instructed all banks and financial institutions to close accounts of individuals or entities engaging in this type of transaction.

The CBN warned in the letter that breaches of the directive will attract severe regulatory sanctions.

This letter sparked a lot of reactions and caused a lot of confusion amongst the people as to whether they can still buy bitcoin in Nigeria and engage in crypto transactions. This prompted interviews with top officials of the CBN and they explained that the CBN release is not to discourage people from trading crypto but it shouldn't be linked to the banking sector.

To clarify things, the CBN explained in a press release on February 7 that the circular was just to enforce the regulation that all banks should not involve in crypto trades, which has been in place since January 2017, stating that no new restriction was placed on digital assets. It also explained that crypto has been a tool to facilitate lots of illegal deals due to its anonymous nature and the directive is to protect the Nigerian financial system and also the majority of Nigerians from the risk associated with crypto transactions.

The CBN concluded that it is not comfortable with crypto and will not stop its effort to educate its citizens to stop using digital assets to protect the financial sector from cybercriminals.

While the CBN seems to have a good intention, a lot of people think the government needs schooling on crypto-related matters and its actions are deliberate and conscious steps to gradually wind down crypto in Nigeria.

However, things have taken a different turn because, despite the ban, crypto continues to thrive in the country. Let's look at why and how crypto continues to thrive despite the ban.

The use of P2P for transactions

While the government ban has prevented all financial institutions and banks from facilitating any crypto transaction and also commanded that they shut down any account that involves in this kind of trade, crypto traders have found a way around this restriction. This ban has somehow limited the operations of traditional/centralized exchanges which are one of the most common ways people buy BTC in Nigeria. On centralized exchanges, people buy bitcoin with Naira directly from their bank and according to the statement released, if you carry out such a transaction, your account will be flagged. The solution to this is peer-to-peer exchanges.

After the ban, Nigerians turned to P2P exchanges for their cryptocurrency transactions. So while the ban was supposed to limit the number of transactions carried out in the country and affect the growth of crypto, Nigerians now trade on P2P platforms like Remita no. On P2P platforms, you don't buy BTC with the Naira directly from the exchange but you buy from another person. The P2P exchange only serves as a marketplace to bring buyers and sellers together.

So on P2P platforms, the buyer transfers the worth of bitcoin or any altcoin he/she wants to buy directly to the seller's bank account just like the normal inter-bank transaction and the seller sends the crypto to the buyer's wallet through the exchange. No financial institution is needed to facilitate the transaction. When you send money directly from one account to another, it is almost impossible for banks to know the purpose of the transaction as it could be used for any other purpose. So P2P trades are difficult for the regulatory bodies to trace and it will be hard to fish out and shut down such accounts.

Cross-border transactions

Strict FX laws have been one of the factors that have aided the use and adoption of cryptocurrency in Nigeria despite the ban. A lot of people in the country have turned to bitcoin for foreign transactions, taking advantage of the decentralized nature of the currency. The ban does not affect the use of crypto for inter-border transfer so far it isn't facilitated by a financial institution. Even before the ban, cross-border transactions have been one of the advantages of bitcoin over the naira and the ban has had little or no effect on it.

In conclusion, there are some other reasons why crypto continues to thrive in Nigeria. A lot of Nigerians use bitcoin to hedge against inflation as naira continues to lose its value, so crypto traders and investors continue to find ways to buy bitcoin in Nigeria. However, the stance of Nigeria regarding crypto is still not solid.

Introducing RENEC - Remitano exchange native token

Global peer-to-peer crypto exchange Remitano is currently developing its native token, RENEC, to improve the quality of services delivered to customers, reduce transaction fees and ensure secure and swift transactions. While RENEC is still in the development phase, Remitano has provided an amazing opportunity for old and new Remitano users in Nigeria to earn FREE RENEC.",https://allafrica.com/stories/202109070016.html,2021-09-07,AllAfrica.com,https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,none
Caitlin Long takes aim at The New York Times over crypto 'alarm' article - FXStreet,"Regulated crypto bank Avanti CEO Caitlin Long says tarring the entire crypto industry with the same brush is unfair.

Avanti Bank and Trust CEO Caitlin Long has posted a rebuttal to a recent New York Times article claiming that crypto and decentralized finance is “disrupting the banking industry” so fast regulators can’t keep up.

Disrupting traditional finance is exactly what crypto and DeFi aspires to do, but the piece titled “Crypto’s Rapid Move Into Banking Elicits Alarm in Washington” published on Sept. 5 had a number of inaccuracies and omissions according to Long.

The primary argument of the piece — using DeFi startup BlockFi as an example — was that crypto derivatives and highly leveraged products have become a nightmare for regulators which are scrambling to catch up. High-stakes speculation is leaving investors vulnerable to major losses according to the NYT.

But Long stated that the issue is not black and white and suggested that “anti-crypto forces” are constantly trying to paint the entire industry with the same brush. “Bad actors deserve to be called out, but the article ignores the fact that regulatory-compliant firms exist,” she added.

1/ @NYtimes story on #crypto/#banking deserves a thoughtful reply. Issue isn't black & white: anti-crypto forces try to paint us all w/ a broad brush. Bad actors deserve to be called out, but the article ignores fact that regulatory-compliant firms exist. https://t.co/IUYTctBGfV — Caitlin Long (@CaitlinLong_) September 5, 2021

Long took particular issue with the fact that the article failed to mention that fully regulated crypto banks already exist, such as her own Wyoming-based Avanti, which launched in October 2020.

She stated that Wyoming’s special bank charter does not allow “cryptocurrency deposits.” Regulated banks can provide custody services for crypto, she continued to explain, but cannot take deposits in anything except fiat currency.

Article misses that critical point — it’s a firewall protecting Fed's payment system from exposure to anything other than $ [USD].

The article also pointed out that many crypto intermediaries have introduced some of the “bad behavior” from traditional finance such as extreme leverage without requiring a capital buffer. These are fair criticisms, according to Long, who has previously cautioned about leverage, adding that very fe crypto intermediaries, such as brokers or third parties acting between the bank and the blockchain, disclose information about their reserves.

Long stated that DeFi platforms in particular do a far better job with transparency than crypto intermediaries or traditional banks which remains one of its best attributes. Banks settle their books once a day while crypto is settled in minutes, and for that reason, the Avanti Bank CEO concluded:

Regulated banks that handle crypto need to be in a straightjacket. That’s the only safe & sound way to integrate the crypto & traditional systems.

Vehemently anti-crypto U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren was still on the warpath this week when she labeled the entire cryptocurrency industry the “new shadow bank” as reported on Sept 7. She expressed particular concerns over stablecoins and their apparent lack of transparency regarding reserves.",https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/caitlin-long-takes-aim-at-the-new-york-times-over-crypto-alarm-article-202109070427,2021-09-07,FXStreet,https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Cryptocurrencies/cryptos_chart_Large.jpg,none
Bitcoin comes to El Salvador on Tuesday; what will it mean? - Cyprus Mail,"El Salvador will on Tuesday become the first country in the world to recognize bitcoin as legal tender, a move President Nayib Bukele says will save Salvadorans living abroad millions of dollars in commissions on money they send home.

Despite Bukele’s popularity, the move has been greeted with skepticism by many Salvadorans who are concerned about the cryptocurrency’s volatility and how his scheme will work.

Following are some of the pros and cons that have surfaced over the El Salvador plan, first launched in June. read more

Salvadorans last year sent home almost $6 billion from abroad, mostly from the United States. The sum is equivalent to some 23 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product.

Bukele said last month bitcoin would deliver “huge benefits” because it would allow Salvadorans to save on $400 million he said was spent each year in commissions for remittances.

But many of the very people sending or receiving dollars to El Salvador are mistrustful of bitcoin. Meanwhile, World Bank data shows that the dollarized Central American country’s U.S. remittance costs are already some of the lowest worldwide.

El Salvador’s bitcoin plan has put a spotlight on the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, with the World Bank flagging such potential adverse affects among its concerns.

Extracting digital currency from cyberspace requires large amounts of energy, and the bitcoin industry’s global CO2 emissions have risen to 60 million tons, equal to the exhaust from about 9 million cars, Bank of America said in March.

Bukele sought to counter sustainability concerns by saying in June he had instructed state-owned geothermal electric firm LaGeo to develop a plan to offer bitcoin mining facilities using renewable energy from the country’s volcanoes.

While advocates pitch bitcoin as innovation that is independent of governmental caprice, it has sparked warnings that it could increase regulatory, financial and operational hazards for financial institutions, among them international anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules.

In June, rating agency Fitch Ratings noted that “capital gains will not be taxed and taxes can be paid in bitcoin, which could attract foreign inflows of bitcoin to the country. This may increase the risks that proceeds from illicit activities pass through the Salvadoran financial system.”

The International Monetary Fund has cited legal concerns about bitcoin’s adoption amid its talks with El Salvador over a nearly $1 billion financing agreement, which remains pending.

After Bukele’s bitcoin law was approved, rating agency Moody’s downgraded El Salvador’s creditworthiness. The country’s dollar-denominated bonds have also come under pressure.

Bukele has set up a $150 million fund to enable conversion of bitcoin into dollars, but doubts persist over how the country will avoid risks linked to sharp fluctuations in the digital currency, whose value can vary by hundreds of dollars in a day.

Fitch argued that bitcoin would be credit negative for Salvadoran insurance companies exposed to the currency due to higher foreign exchange and earnings volatility risk.

“Insurers that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets for extended periods will be acutely exposed to its price volatility, increasing asset risk,” Fitch said last month.

Still, for those holding bitcoin, it has proven a popular means of payment in El Zonte, a beach town that was one of the springboards for the cryptocurrency in El Salvador.

Senegalese locals left disillusioned by lack of progress on Akon City While originally spruiked as a futuristic city inspired by the Marvel movie Black Panther that would emerge as a “beacon of innovation and human development” and bolster the West African and Senegalese economies by Akon in 2018, there are few signs of the city’s development beyond a ceremonial stone that was laid in a field near Mbodiene 12 months ago. According to a report from Agence France-Press, the project has not progressed beyond the stone’s erection, with a small placard promoting Akon City having since fallen from its perch on top of the block.

Shiba Inu: Did Shiba Coin resumes the hype? - Thewistle,"Shiba Inu, the meme cryptocurrency has gone through a hard decline in the past few weeks. Somehow, it has managed and gained its standing position. While still, it is below the All-Time High value, it reached on May 10th.

The Shiba Coin price is still fluctuating, as currently, it is trading at $0.000007132 at the time of writing. The coin could experience hype once it’s been listed on the Robinhood exchange.

A petition has been signed on Change.org to get the token listed on the free exchange. Well, there isn’t any information regarding its listing officially. But we could expect it as soon as possible. Similarly, it has been listed on eToro and other popular platforms recently.

Furthermore, the analysts suggest that Shiba Token might overtake the meme coin (Dogecoin). As the coin is gradually growing and might get a sudden hype in its price.

According to FxStreet, “The token’s price has been up nearly 20% in the past 30 days, and trader sentiment is bullish as SHIB continues its climb. A mysterious large wallet investor recently added 150 billion SHIB to their wallet while the token witnessed a massive surge in price. The whale is known to have converted their Ethereum holdings to Shiba Inu coins”.

China's Trade Unexpectedly Surges Despite Virus Outbreaks - Investing.com India,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s export growth unexpectedly surged in August, with port disruptions due to fresh outbreaks of the delta virus having limited impact on trade.

Exports rose 25.6% in dollar terms from a year earlier, while imports grew 33.1%, the customs administration said Tuesday, resulting in a trade surplus of $58.3 billion for the month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast exports would increase 17.3% and imports would rise 26.9%.

The pickup came despite port delays and high shipping costs, which have disrupted global supply chains. Signs of a slowdown are starting to emerge globally as Covid cases rise, and while officials have warned of weaker export growth for the rest of the year as risks and challenges build, it’s yet to weigh on the actual value of exports.

Manufacturing surveys last week showed a contraction in new export orders for a fourth consecutive month in August, which may signal a slowdown in the future. Beyond trade, the economy is taking a knock from a plunge in services activity related to Covid restrictions, a tightening in property curbs and lower infrastructure spending.
