What Is A Cryptocurrency Exchange? How To Start Trading In It? - NDTV Profit,"For new investors, cryptocurrency is the buzzword. As much as it is promising in terms of giving returns over a short time, it is also volatile and risky. The whole idea of cryptocurrency is based on a distributed ledger that stores information on every transaction or trade. Also, the trade is protected by high-grade cryptography. The simplest way of investing in cryptocurrency is by trading (buying and selling) of any crypto coin like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Cadence, etc. These are done through online exchanges where investors open an account and start the trade.

What Is A Cryptocurrency Exchange?

These platforms facilitate cryptocurrency trading in exchange for digital and fiat currencies. They act as an intermediary between a buyer and a seller and charge a commission or transaction fee. CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber, and UnoCoin are some examples of online exchanges operating in India. An investor can also use an online exchange to convert their crypto coins back into fiat currency (Indian Rupee or US Dollar) for withdrawing the amount from their bank account later.

How Does It Work?

A cryptocurrency exchange acts like an intermediary – a brokerage firm – between a buyer and a seller of cryptocurrency. It allows a buyer to deposit money using several methods like direct bank transfer, UPI, using debit or credit cards, etc. It charges a set commission or fee for every transaction done using its services.

The first thing a buyer (or investor) will need to do is to find the right online exchange. This step will require a fair bit of research about the platform's history, credibility, and what benefits it will offer you for trading. The next step is opening a trading account, which is fairly simple.

Download an app of the exchange you have selected and create an account. It will ask you for some information like your email address. It will then send a verification email to that address and may also ask for KYC details. Verify the address on your email id and complete the KYC process. Then set a password on the app and you are set to launch yourself in the world of cryptocurrency.

Do not lose any passwords related to the app, wallet, or exchange. They may not be recovered.",https://www.ndtv.com/business/cryptocurrency-exchange-how-do-cryptocurrency-exchanges-work-2527631,2021-09-04,NDTV Profit,https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-08/ogfsfjs8_bitcoin_625x300_04_August_21.jpg,none
COCO Cocoin Cryptocurrency Top Community-Driven Limited Altcoin System Expanded - Yahoo Finance,"Crypto Marketing Company announces the expansion of the Cocoin cryptocurrency system to introduce strategies developed from suggestions voted on by its investor community. These strategies will expand the token's foothold in the crypto space and provide perks for token holders.

London, United Kingdom, Sept. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

As a highly-rated altcoin, Cocoin is capitalizing on its community-driven approach to launch innovations that are unique to the crypto space. Crypto Marketing Company has announced current and upcoming innovations including the establishment of a beverage production operation and the purchase of a private island for token holders.

Further information is available here: https://schooner.io/cocoin-finance

According to Crypto Marketing Company, the expansion will provide the Cocoin community with an intuitive deflationary cryptocurrency system that emphasizes community engagement as its long-term strategy and protects against common drawbacks of the crypto industry.

Cocoin’s system burns a consistent amount of coins at planned intervals to ensure effective control of the coin’s value over time. The system applies a 10% tax on all transactions and distributes the proceeds across its in-house charity fund, a liquidity pool, marketing and innovation initiatives, token holders, and other reserves. Higher tax requirements are placed on large transactions to protect token holders against investment whales who engage in “pump and dump” schemes.

Cocoin’s development team maintains a fully engaged communication system with its community of token holders. On the suggestion of community members, the team is currently considering plans to purchase a 12-acre private island for the use of members who have notable coin holdings.

The Cocoin team also considers promising member suggestions, such as the establishment of a COCO energy drink, an online store, a De-Fi exchange, and more. The Cocoin community is hosted on the Telegram app under the Group name “$COCO Community Official”, which can be accessed at: https://schooner.io/cocoin-community-official

"An investor's guide to Cardano, which has mysteriously become the No. 3 crypto in the world - CNBC","Ether, the digital token of the Ethereum blockchain, is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market value.

The Cardano blockchain's ada token, the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko, hit an all-time high Thursday of $3.09, after breaking past $3 on Wednesday.

The surge in demand for the altcoin comes amid renewed interest in NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and continued enthusiasm for DeFi, or decentralized finance. Both parts of the crypto world build most projects on the Ethereum blockchain, but alternatives including Cardano have become more attractive to developers.

New law set to transform cryptoverse & how! - Economic Times,"The Cryptocurrency Bill is still awaiting Cabinet approval and tabling in Parliament. Not much is known about the contents of the bill. This has been making many people nervous in the cryptoverse – the expanding universe of all crypto investors, players, dealers, enthusiasts, platforms and app developers.this week reported that through the bill the government may finally come clear on many questions surrounding the cryptoverse. This is a welcome development and may spur a lot of economic activity and innovations around cryptos. Apart from that, there may be follow-through acceptance happening in many other areas like state laws and various policy frameworks.As a starting point, the bill will have to define what may qualify as a valid crypto. This itself may be a good beginning, as it may set a benchmark standard for inclusion (or exclusion) of a crypto asset.Depending on how the bill defines crypto and how its treatment follows from that in terms of taxation and regulation, the cryptoverse may choose their play. If they find the definition and ensuing rules etc favourable to their businesses, they may want to position their products as valid cryptos. Should the definitions etc be non-conducive, they may choose not to identify them as cryptos at all.There is a lot of innovation yet to happen in the industry, and therefore notwithstanding the level of clarity in the definition, there will be an expected grey area for a few years to come – something that may even be good for innovation to prosper.One thing that the government and RBI have been clear and consistent about is that they would not accept any crypto as part of the payment and settlement framework. So, we are definitely not going to see cryptocurrency coming up as a valid tender for payments. Instead, the bill itself may enable RBI to create a crypto equivalent of the country’s fiat currency, also called as Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). RBI has been working on its CBDC project and its rollout is expected by the end of the year. This, however, will depend on the crypto bill being passed by Parliament before that.The cryptoverse has been seeking to settle for the next best thing – being accepted as a Digital Asset or a Commodity . Asreported, the government definition of an asset itself is in question, as there is no hard and fast definition of an asset so far. That said, the Income-Tax department does define what is a capital asset. In simple terms, it essentially defines a capital asset as one, whose future value may not be ascertained at present. The cryptoverse may itself need to define what constitutes an 'asset' before further defining a 'Digital Asset'. All this clarity may spur innovation at every level and also determine the choice of classification based on end-use.The bill may classify the cryptos as commodity or digital asset. Even after they get their class recognition, cryptos will need to be regulated (or not) based on the end use of the product or the platform. It has also been debated whether the cryptos must be regulated uniformly under one set of regulations. This, however, may not be possible.The most known cryptos are Bitcoin and Ether – owing to the interest in their trading and ever-increasing values. While these cryptos have been the torch-bearers of the technology, most of them were originally created to become functional payment vehicles and, therefore, the name cryptocurrency. While they could not become acceptable cryptocurrencies, the world has adapted to use them as new trading vehicles and slowly they have become ‘digital assets’ whose value keeps on changing based on demand and supply. These cryptocurrency tokens inherently do not represent anything specific.On the other hand, there are more specific purpose cryptos that represent an underlying value or ownership of something. As an example, my own company RealX has been waiting on these regulations to explore if there can be a legitimate case for tokenizing real estate – essentially creating a digital asset (crypto) -- that represents ownership of a certain property. There is a new craze for something called NFTs (non-fungible tokens). An NFT essentially is another example of a ‘digital asset’ and represents the ownership of any item – it may be physical items like a real painting or even digital items like a song or copyright to an intellectual property. Similarly, there can be tokenisation of revenue streams coming from investment in solar installations or trade receivables.The cryptoverse is only going to expand its horizons with more legitimacy and clarity in regulations. While the underlying technology behind them may be conceptually similar, the implementations and their end use may be vastly different. Therefore, it is simply not possible to regulate all of these under one umbrella law.The crypto bill must, however, set some common benchmarks on what may be a valid crypto and what may be a valid crypto transaction. Such common minimum compliance must apply to all crypto tokens and may be looked at as an extension of the Information Technology Act, specifically applicable to ‘digital assets’.It may be possible to categorise the generic cryptos (originally called cryptocurrencies) as commodities, while many specific application cryptos that represent something of value may be classified as digital assets.The cryptocurrency bill may be a gamechanger for the country. It may spur large-scale innovation and application of cryptos as a technology into multiple applications where ‘digital assets’ can be created. The pandemic has left the government looking at more sources of revenues and it may expect some of it to be filled in through the direct and indirect revenues generated through regularisation of cryptos. It will also leapfrog India from being a nation reluctant in crypto adoption to an innovation powerhouse in digital assets.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/new-law-set-to-transform-cryptoverse-how/articleshow/85924303.cms,2021-09-04,Economic Times,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85924330,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43832,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg",none
Law Project Establishes Period to Decide Cryptocurrency Regulations in Brazil – Regulation Bitcoin News - Bitcoin News,"Law Project Establishes Period to Decide Cryptocurrency Regulations in Brazil

A law project introduced in June in the National Congress of Brazil has jumped into the spotlight recently because it establishes a fixed period for the executive to start regulating cryptocurrency transactions. If approved, the proposal will establish the payment of taxes for cryptocurrency-based transactions. The project is being reviewed by the Chamber of Deputies and will have to be analyzed conclusively by the Finance and Taxation Committee.

Cryptocurrency Transactions to Be Regulated in Brazil

A law project proposal, Bill 2140/21, that was introduced to the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil in June, is now in the spotlight because it establishes a fixed period for the regulation of cryptocurrency transactions for the executive branch of the government. If approved, it would give a time limit of 180 days to devise all the necessary structures to regulate cryptocurrency transactions in an effective way. The project was presented by the deputy Alexandre Frota, part of the Partido de la Social Democracia Brasileña (PSDB).

Frota states that the absence of clear regulation for cryptocurrencies puts investors and the traditional financial system at risk, as crypto can aid in getting funds out of the country with no supervision. Frota declared:

With private and public banks, it is necessary to have rigorous regulation and inspection so that the population will not be deceived with promises of high individual profits, which has already happened to a great extent.

Brazil has been a country known for its crime associated with crypto-related scams in the last few years. The state has been fast to act when it comes to stopping these schemes, organizing several operations to shut down and arrest those responsible for illegal cryptocurrency-related activity over the last few months.

Taxes Could Be Coming

Another important part of the project states that operations carried out abroad must be scrutinized according to the same rules applied to banks, including taxation norms. However, it is still unclear how this might be carried out, due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions. This issue is currently being tackled by a special committee of the Chamber of Deputies.

However, Brazil is very much open to the issuance of a central bank digital currency. The Central Bank of Brazil is researching the creation of a Digital Real and debating if there is really a demand for such an instrument from the Brazilian population.

Japan's Financial Giant SBI to Launch Cryptocurrency Fund – Finance Bitcoin News - Bitcoin News,"Japan's Financial Giant SBI to Launch Cryptocurrency Fund

Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings is reportedly launching a crypto fund that will invest in several cryptocurrencies. “I want people to hold it together with other assets and experience firsthand how useful it can be for diversifying portfolios,” said an executive of the company.

SBI Holdings Launching Crypto Fund

SBI Holdings Inc. has revealed its plan to launch a cryptocurrency fund by the end of November, Bloomberg reported Thursday, calling it the country’s first crypto fund.

Tomoya Asakura, director of SBI Asset Management and president of SBI affiliate Morningstar Japan, explained that the fund will invest in a number of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, and litecoin.

He added that the fund is aimed at customers who understand the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including their high volatility. In addition, there may be a minimum investment of about one million yen ($9,122) to three million yen.

Asakura noted in a recent interview that if the first fund “goes very well,” then the firm would like to “move quickly” to launch a second fund. He opined:

I want people to hold it together with other assets and experience firsthand how useful it can be for diversifying portfolios.

SBI is also considering launching another fund specifically tailored to institutional investors if there is enough demand for the product, the executive noted.

Due to strict crypto regulations following hacking incidents at exchanges in Japan, it has taken SBI four years to get its crypto fund off the ground, the publication conveyed. It added that the company had to change its plan of how the fund is offered to investors to comply with regulations.

SBI initially planned to launch its crypto fund as an investment trust, a popular investing method in Japan. However, the country’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), banned companies from selling crypto investments using this method. The company then changed its plan and will offer its crypto fund to investors using a vehicle known as an “anonymous partnership.”

Asakura noted that “There is an overwhelming perception that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and speculative.” He plans to build a track record to show the public and regulators that cryptocurrencies can help investors diversify their portfolios.

2 programmers estimate billions of dollars worth of bitcoin is recoverable - Markets Insider,"Charlie and Chris Brooks run Crypto Asset Recovery, a small business in New Hampshire. Crypto Asset Recovery

A father and son team of computer programmers help people find lost passwords to their crypto wallets.

Chris and Charlie Brooks conducted an analysis that led them to estimate between 68,110 and 92,855 seemingly lost bitcoins are recoverable.

At current prices, the high end of the recoverable bitcoin estimate amounts to $4.7 billion.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

For Chris and Charlie Brooks, finding lost passwords to cryptocurrency wallets requires figuring out how their clients' minds work - and that effort can help their customers retrieve a slice of what the pair estimates is about $4.7 billion worth of recoverable bitcoin stranded in locked wallets.

""We get a really broad spectrum of clients. We have a client who is an early-stage miner in bitcoin who lost all of his information and he knows he's got some bitcoins somewhere … We get clients who were told in 2017 to buy into the hype-bubble and they bought $1,000 [worth] and they are looking for something to cover the rent,"" Charlie, a 20-year-old computer programmer who joined his father in running Crypto Asset Recovery based in New Hampshire, told Insider in a video interview.

""One of our most recent cracks had about $250,000,"" in a blockchain wallet, said Charlie, who majored in computer science in college. He's put school aside for now to work at the business. ""This is something I've always liked. I would follow along with my dad ... Online treasure hunting, it seemed really cool.""

Nearly 40% of 1,000 US crypto owners in a recent survey from Cryptovantage said they had lost wallet passwords and, on average, those unable to find their passwords lost $2,134.

The jumping-off point of the duo's estimate of what can be recovered was a Chainalysis estimate that up to 20% of 18.5 million existing bitcoin appear to be lost or stranded in locked wallets. The figures were cited in January by The New York Times in a story about a San Francisco-based programmer who couldn't find the password to the hard drive that stored his 7,002 bitcoin. After eight wrong guesses, he had two left to figure out the password before the virtual currency was likely lost forever.

The Chainalysis figure sparked a question for the Brookses.

""Yes, that bitcoin is lost but if the owner of that bitcoin were motivated, what percentage of those do we think is reasonable to assume could be recovered?,"" said Chris, a 50-year-old computer programmer who started his business in 2017 and, after some time retooling, ramped up operations late last year when his son came on board.

Nakamoto's forum

To find a sample of lost bitcoin for their analysis, Chris said they turned to a thread on BitcoinTalk, a forum whose creation is credited to bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. A thread started in 2011 called ""Let's add up the KNOWN lost bitcoins"" is filled with posts by people with the amount of bitcoin they lost and how it happened. The Brookses filtered and set parameters on the information, such as excluding losses of less than half of a bitcoin, to make an estimate on the sample population of the bitcoin reported lost.

The Brookses narrowed it all down to 72 posts that described the loss of at least half of a bitcoin. They determined that 14% are potentially recoverable cases and that from their own work in recovering wallets for clients, they can decrypt about 35% of passwords. That led to their conclusion that about 2.45% of lost bitcoin is retrievable. With a range between 68,110 and 92,855 bitcoins, that would make up to $4.7 billion in bitcoin recoverable based on the asset's price of about $50,372 on Friday.

Good guesses

""We get as good a list of passwords as we can from a client and then we put our heads together and spend some time extrapolating the way that they make their passwords and try to get in their mind when they are actually creating a password,"" said Charlie. ""That's the most helpful thing, just seeing their practice,"" he said. ""That's the cornerstone of our business, essentially.""

The duo will run ""hundreds of millions or billions of variations"" of password patterns and test those against the encrypted version of the wallet, said Chris.

""If you don't have a very good [password] guess, there are more possible passwords than there are atoms in the universe, and I'm not being facetious when I say that,"" Chris said.

The Brookses said decrypting times vary but occasionally can take as little as five seconds. That happened with a client whose list of nine potential passwords contained the correct one. Charlie said they worked for roughly a month and a half with the client who turned out to have about $250,000 in his wallet.

Security measures they take include having clients sign a contract stating they are the owner of the blockchain wallet being worked on. The two get paid on a sliding scale. Starting with wallets containing between zero and 10 bitcoins, or an equivalent value, the team will earn a 20% commission. There's no charge to clients if they can't recover any funds.

Chris said a number of their clients live in countries where people are largely unbanked.

""They may have a wallet with a couple of hundreds of dollars in it and that is their life savings. If they lose the password to it, they have no access to it anymore,"" said Chris. ""In some sense, it can be a heartbreaking piece of the business … we do crack some of [the wallets]. It's a balancing act to be helpful without going too far down a rabbit hole.""",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/locked-crypto-wallet-password-recovery-cryptocurrency-chris-charlie-brooks-btc-2021-9,2021-09-04,Markets Insider,https://images2.markets.businessinsider.com/6131ff9dee41b9001972273f?format=jpeg,none
"Ethereum, The Second-Largest Cryptocurrency, Has Split into Two Versions - Analytics Insight","Ethereum, The Second-Largest Cryptocurrency, Has Split into Two Versions

In the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum has now split into two chains. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency as per the market cap, Ethereum’s split happened as its old Ethereum network’s nodes have failed to upgrade to the ‘Hades Gamma’ patch. The patch was released on 24th August and a bug was detected in the 1.10.7 version of the Ethereum network.

Its old network, Go Ethereum informed its users on Twitter on August 27 about the split and information about the 1.10.8 version in terms of security. The team asked users to upgrade their nodes having Hades Gamma patch to the new version if they already haven’t done so. Geth is a command-line interface that runs Ethereum nodes implemented in the Go language. Geth enables the users to join the Ethereum network, make transactions between accounts, and mine Ether.

All the information about the blockchain is stored on the network in the form of transactions chains. As each chain gets verified, every transaction is then added to the digital ledger. Now that there is a split in the chain, all the transactions will not be verified by all the nodes. Hence, the split is an understandable cause of concern for Ethereum investors and Ethereum-based applications. It increases the occurrence of double-spending, which refers to a single transaction being registered more than once, allowing users to misinterpret the amount in the wallet. Until this issue is fixed, experts are advising users to not make any transactions.",https://www.analyticsinsight.net/ethereum-the-second-largest-cryptocurrency-has-split-into-two-versions/,2021-09-04,Analytics Insight,https://analyticsinsight.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ethereum-The-Second-Largest-Cryptocurrency-Has-Split-into-Two-Versions.jpg,none

In the last bit of crypto news for today, we have Unbound Finance integrating with Harmony blockchain to accelerate inter-blockchain operability and profitability. Moreover, Unbound Finance is a non-custodial protocol that aims to unlock liquidity. With this integration, network users can borrow UND by collateralizing liquidity across AMMs on the Harmony blockchain, without compromising on the incentives gained from those funds.

Further, this would empower UND to be used across Harmony-based DEXes such as Mochiswap, Openswap, ViperSwap, and SushiSwap. In addition, this would help users to earn extra without affecting their investments in liquidity pools. In turn, users can also utilize the liquidity pool tokens as collateral to accumulate UND stablecoins on Unbound.

Law Project Establishes Period To Decide Cryptocurrency Regulations In Brazil – Regulation Bitcoin News - - Todayuknews,"A law project introduced in June in the National Congress of Brazil has jumped into the spotlight recently because it establishes a fixed period for the executive to start regulating cryptocurrency transactions. If approved, the proposal will establish the payment of taxes for cryptocurrency-based transactions. The project is being reviewed by the Chamber of Deputies and will have to be analyzed conclusively by the Finance and Taxation Committee.

Cryptocurrency Transactions to Be Regulated in Brazil

A law project proposal, Bill 2140/21, that was introduced to the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil in June, is now in the spotlight because it establishes a fixed period for the regulation of cryptocurrency transactions for the executive branch of the government. If approved, it would give a time limit of 180 days to devise all the necessary structures to regulate cryptocurrency transactions in an effective way. The project was presented by the deputy Alexandre Frota, part of the Partido de la Social Democracia Brasileña (PSDB).

Frota states that the absence of clear regulation for cryptocurrencies puts investors and the traditional financial system at risk, as crypto can aid in getting funds out of the country with no supervision. Frota declared:

With private and public banks, it is necessary to have rigorous regulation and inspection so that the population will not be deceived with promises of high individual profits, which has already happened to a great extent.

Brazil has been a country known for its crime associated with crypto-related scams in the last few years. The state has been fast to act when it comes to stopping these schemes, organizing several operations to shut down and arrest those responsible for illegal cryptocurrency-related activity over the last few months.





Taxes Could Be Coming

Another important part of the project states that operations carried out abroad must be scrutinized according to the same rules applied to banks, including taxation norms. However, it is still unclear how this might be carried out, due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions. This issue is currently being tackled by a special committee of the Chamber of Deputies.

However, Brazil is very much open to the issuance of a central bank digital currency. The Central Bank of Brazil is researching the creation of a Digital Real and debating if there is really a demand for such an instrument from the Brazilian population.

Cryptocurrency manager Trust Investing leader released in Cuba - Market Research Telecast,"Havana, Sep 3 (EFE) .- The leader of the cryptocurrency manager Trust Investing in Cuba, Ruslan Concepción, was released this Friday along with several of his collaborators, members of the group reported on his Facebook social network page.

“They have just released Ruslan and the leaders of (the province of) Las Tunas,” wrote a user on the Trust Investing CUBA profile, where a short video is also released that includes the moment of their release from prison and their reunion. with relatives.

The director of Trust Investing on the island, Ruslan Concepción, had been detained since the end of April for an alleged “illicit economic activity”, as were other affiliates of that cryptocurrency manager in the eastern province of Las Tunas, as reported by relatives and users on social networks.

The arrest of Concepción, a 28-year-old industrial engineer, took place at the José Martí International Airport in Havana when he was preparing to travel to Russia.

Trust Investing presents itself on its website as a “crypto asset management in the most daring markets” company that has “a high liquidity index” and offers its clients and partners “the opportunity to be an integral part of this innovative market “.

This cryptocurrency trading platform, designated by some as a pyramid scam, claims to have a network of delegates in several countries such as Spain, Cuba, Brazil, England, Italy, Mexico and the United States.

In Cuba it has reached a relatively high popularity with thousands of investors, many of whom had requested the release of what they consider their “leader” through social networks.

The National Securities Market Commission of Spain (CNMV) and the Superintendency of the Securities Market of the Republic of Panama (SMV) issued separate statements last year to clarify that Trust Investing lacks a license to operate investments in their respective countries.

According to the fraudulent activity analysis firm Tulip Research, this manager “works like a ponzi scheme, does not have a real product and pays its investors with their incoming money.”

Xiaomi has started accepting cryptocurrency payments in Portugal - InTallaght,"Xiaomi has sent us the following clarification to the published information. Today we learned that “Mi Store Portugal” has published information on the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a payment method on its channel on a social network. From Xiaomi Corporation we would like to clarify that both “Mi Store Portugal”, and its associated channels, are managed by a third party. Thus, although we respect and understand the legitimate operational autonomy of third-party stores, the decision to accept cryptocurrencies has no relationship with the company and has been made without the entity’s knowledge or approval. The company’s official distributor, Mi Store Portugal, has recently made the decision to accept payments in digital currencies known as Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to a BolNews report, the Chinese tech giant now allows Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and even Dash payments for the purchase of smartphones, smartwatches, along with other smart home products and devices. Xiaomi has partnered with Utrust, a Swiss cryptocurrency payment service provider, to enable payment via digital assets in the region. According to Pedro Maia, Marketing Manager at Mi Store Portugal: We are a technological, innovative and disruptive brand. That is why we always want to be one step ahead. We want to give all true technology fans the possibility to buy their favorite gadgets with what is currently the most technological money. Portugal is one of the most cryptocurrency-friendly European governments due to its tax laws. Therefore, it is not surprising that the brand has chosen Portugal as a test for payments with digital currencies.",https://voonze.com/xiaomi-has-started-accepting-cryptocurrency-payments-in-portugal/,2021-09-04,InTallaght,https://voonze.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mi-Store.jpg,none
European Citizens Reject EU-Imposed Crypto Regulation – Bitcoin News - Bitcoin News,"European Citizens Reject EU-Imposed Crypto Regulation

Most European citizens reject the idea of a cryptocurrency regulation regime imposed by the European Union (EU) on its member states, according to a recent survey. Most surveyed citizens lean towards independent cryptocurrency regulation in each country, compared to 25% that approve an EU-imposed regulation. However, most of the citizens polled acknowledged they still don’t know much about cryptocurrencies in the first place.

Europeans Reject EU Crypto Laws, Favor Local Proposals

European citizens are against the establishment of EU-imposed cryptocurrency-related laws, according to a recent survey ordered by Euronews. The poll, that was carried out by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, a global consulting firm, polled more than 31,000 citizens in 12 states of the European block: Germany, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Spain.

The survey found that most Europeans support locally issued laws instead of a set of rules imposed by the European Union. Citizens from Greece (51%), Italy (47%), Estonia (46%), Netherlands (41%), Germany (40%), Latvia (39%), and France (37%) said they would prefer their own government to regulate cryptocurrencies.

Also, a surprisingly high number of citizens would prefer the issuance of local cryptocurrencies instead of a digital euro, something that shows more and more Europeans blame economic inefficiencies on the European Union integration. Dimitar Lilkov, from the Wilfried Martens Center for European Studies in Brussels, stated:

A large part of the population remains convinced that the crisis was caused by poor decisions made at the EU level and not by serious deficiencies in its national banking sector.

However, the affiliation of each country with the EU impedes this from being a reality. Italians (41%), Greeks (40%), Estonians (39%), and Spaniards (37%) registered the highest support for the initiative. On this, Likov stated:

Eurozone countries that want to make use of a digital currency would be linked to a potential digital euro, led by the ECB in coordination with the eurozone banking system.

To him, any country issuing its own central bank digital currency would have to exit the EU in order to do so due to the possibility of a digital euro happening in the future.

Cryptocurrency Still Unknown

The survey also revealed that most European citizens have only just heard “a little” about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This shows that, even with the recent boom of crypto assets due to a bull season, there is still room for people to get better informed about cryptocurrencies and their proposals. In fact, the lack of knowledge about cryptocurrencies appears again in the survey as the main reason why Europeans have avoided purchasing crypto assets.

"Twitter May Soon Let Users Add Bitcoin, Ethereum Addresses to Their Profiles for Tips - Gadgets 360","Twitter is found to be working on allowing users to add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their profiles to receive tips in cryptocurrencies. The new addition could be aimed to upgrade the Tip Jar feature that the microblogging network introduced earlier this year. Twitter is working on the ability to let users receive tips in Bitcoin through the Tip Jar feature. CEO Jack Dorsey in July suggested the implementation by calling Bitcoin a “big part” of the company's future in conversation with analysts and investors.

Mobile app developer Alessandro Paluzzi has found references about Twitter bringing the ability to let users add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their profiles. The developer posted a tweet that carried three screenshots to indicate the new options.

The first screenshot suggests that users would be able to copy Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to send tips in any of the two cryptocurrencies using the Tip Jar feature. In the second and third ones, Twitter appears to allow users to add Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses to their profiles.

#Twitter is working to allow you to add your #Bitcoin and #Ethereum address to your profile to receive tips via the Tip Jar feature 👀



ℹ️ It is not necessary to link a Strike account to add them to your profile. pic.twitter.com/xT9Tg1vdzR — Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) September 2, 2021

Alongside the screenshots suggesting the addition of Bitcoin and Ethereum address options, Paluzzi on Wednesday tweeted a screenshot to suggest the arrival of Bitcoin support to the Tip Jar feature. That tweet received a comment from Twitter's product lead Kayvon Beykpour that includes a lightning bolt emoji along with another saying “soon” to confirm its development and its imminent release.

Beykpour did not provide any further details about when exactly the ability to receive tips in Bitcoin through Tip Jar will be available to users. However, the screenshot posted by Paluzzi does suggest that Twitter would consider payment transfer technology The Lightning Network to allow tipping in Bitcoin on its platform.

The screenshot also suggested that Twitter would use Strike to generate Bitcoin Lightning invoices for the cryptocurrency tips users will get through the platform. Paluzzi on his newer tweet, though, says that users will not be required to link a Strike account for adding their Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses.

A report by MacRumor says that the work for Bitcoin tips has been suggested through Twitter for iOS beta code. It isn't available to beta testers at this moment, though.

In May, Twitter introduced its Tip Jar feature to let creators, journalists, and nonprofits monetise their tweets in the form of tips. The company initially enabled users to share links to their Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, Paypal, and Venmo accounts for receiving tips from their followers. That was, however, just the beginning as the platform appears to be adding cryptocurrencies as the new payment options.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has advocated cryptocurrencies for some time. In August, he said that Bitcoin would “unite a deeply divided country.” Dorsey during Twitter's earnings call in July also called the “big part” of Twitter's future.

“I think there's a lot of innovation above just currency to be had, especially as we think about decentralising social media more and providing more economic incentive,” he said while answering a question on how he sees Bitcoin becoming an integral part of Twitter.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/twitter-cryptocurrency-donation-bitcoin-ethereum-addresses-tips-tip-jar-feature-update-2529649,2021-09-04,Gadgets 360,https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/twitter_logo_main_pixabay_1620814744949.jpg,none
Australian government warns cryptocurrency investors - Micky News,"The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has issued a warning on the country’s crypto investors and urged them to be cautious on crypto products from unlicensed companies.

According to Australian law, crypto exchanges would not be provided by a license unless they offer a financial product. Also, ASIC does not consider any crypto or token to be a form of financial product.

The Commission has released this warning in response to the mounting complaints from Australians who have used financial services from unlicensed platforms.

The complainants said that when they traded options and futures on these platforms, they experienced big losses from their investments. But a lot of people from crypto trading circles are doubting that sending this warning through a press release is the best thing to do to deal with the situation.

Problematic situation

“Press releases with no data but containing warnings are problematic. Readers need to understand what the problem and real risk they are facing,” Michael Bacina, a board member of Blockchain Australia, said.

Since the Colonial Pipeline hacking incident in the U.S., where cryptocurrencies were demanded as a form of ransom, governments all over the world became more aware of cryptos’ possible risks.

Crypto warning

According to Bacina, Australians should be more careful in interacting with offshore businesses or unlicensed financial services, because the possibility of big losses is imminent.

He emphasized that the protection provided by the country’s regulatory system may not be available for those who are dealing with offshore entities. This could also discourage Australians from interacting with these businesses because they wouldn’t have a safety net to fall on.

"Investor confidence most important thing for crypto industry: Nischal Shetty, WazirX - Economic Times","We are in a financial sector and regulatory clarity brings in more investor confidence , which is the most important thing that this sector needs. So, we are all pushing for regulations in the sector as an industry, said, Founder & CEO,during ET Now's India Development Debate on the new crypto bill. Edited excerpts:Absolutely, I think that is a really positive step for the entire ecosystem. In fact, everyone is finally happy about this classification because before this it was all about putting crypto under one basic umbrella of currency and now there is finally talk about how to classify into various categories.So, asset or commodities is one of the many categories. There is also the obvious one: currency. But the majority of the use cases they fall under are utility. The fourth is a security. So, there are four major classifications of crypto and it is a welcome move for the entire industry. We are all excited; it is a great progress for the entire ecosystem.In terms of absolute numbers, I think on our exchange WazirX alone we have added more than 4 or 5 million people in – not even one year – under seven to eight months. That is a massive number of people entering the whole crypto ecosystem. As an industry we are now well over 15 to 17 million people in the whole ecosystem and that is just testament to the fact that everyone in India is looking forward to crypto as an asset class.Now your question about whether this is hampering growth. For sure, that is a yes. It is hampering growth, not just for one or two companies, but for the entire sector. Let us take for example investments in startups in the sector. India still ranks as one of the lower numbers compared to anywhere in the world like US and UK. In terms of even the number of start-ups that has grown large in India, it is considerably lower compared to the rest of the world.This is the regulatory uncertainty playing. Despite this, the growth and the number of people entering the ecosystem is really going well. But ultimately, we are in a financial sector and regulatory clarity brings in more investor confidence, which is the most important thing that this sector needs. So, we are all pushing for regulations in the sector as an industry.Not really. I think in fact that is a good point that you raised. I do not think crypto is trying to replace or compete with fiat currencies like the INR or the US dollar. What it is trying to do is fill the gaps on the internet which traditional currency does not really fulfil. There are lots of those opportunities that crypto is already existing. As simple as today, in the lack of regulation and no payment use case, the industry is still over $2 trillion in market cap and that itself just proves that crypto does not really need to come into the traditional payment mechanism.But it can fulfil payment use cases which traditional currencies do not. For example, cross-border payments that might be use case in remittance for India. That might be a use case that might emerge in the future. But again, as on today, the success of crypto currencies come in the use case where you need to pay for smart contracts on the block chains for example. There you cannot use traditional currency, so that is where majority of the use cases lie. That is where the progress is happening as on today. So, I do not really believe that the traditional payment use cases are something of a dampener. Cryptos cannot get into that.Look, the most important thing to understand out here is the largest age group – the demographic of people in crypto – is 23 to 30 years. This is the internet first population. If there is one thing they are really good at, it is extracting information online. I believe that most of them are well read and they understand. But apart from that, as an ecosystem what we are all doing is spreading the right information about crypto through education initiatives as an industry.We, in fact, also have an industry effort to self-regulate ourselves even in the absence of regulation. So, I think all of these are adding to an informed ecosystem. I do not really believe that we have a problem of misinformation. In fact, the misinformation tends to be more towards negative. There are people who think that India has banned crypto, which is not the case. So, there is no one who thinks that crypto is all regulated and it is all hunky-dory. People are coming with a view that it is still unregulated and the government has still not taken a hard position on that. So, let us invest cautiously. That is what a majority of people in the ecosystem have an outlook towards.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/investor-confidence-most-important-thing-for-crypto-industry-nischal-shetty-wazirx/articleshow/85923202.cms,2021-09-04,Economic Times,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-85923291,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-105105,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",none

Binance also provides several options for institutions. But unlike Kraken, Binance offers hundreds of cryptocurrencies, making it more ideal for traders who want access to a much larger selection of coins and tokens.

On the trading side of things, your options include peer-to-peer transactions, the Classic Binance trading interface, the advanced trading platform, and Binance's over-the-counter (OTC) trading portal.

While US users won't have access to Binance, they can use the Binance.US platform. This platform doesn't offer as many assets, but it still offers multiple features for individuals and institutions.

Binance Earn is great for traders who want to earn interest from staking different assets. Plus, traders can utilize Binance Loan to take out crypto loans. And if you're big on crypto spending, you can use the Binance Visa card to purchase items across the globe.

As for its institutional services, Binance offers staking and savings products, OTC trading, futures and options trading, margin trading, and much more. Learn more about Binance's institutional products here.

Binance's services are available 24/7.

Kraken vs Binance: Which is right for you?

Kraken and Binance both offer cryptocurrency exchange services on a global level, providing features like staking, margin and futures trading, institutional services, and more. However, there are still notable differences in each platform's fees, investment choices, and products.

Though Kraken doesn't serve New York or Washington state residents, it's a better option for US traders in search of a relatively simple user interface and trading platform. But if you're not a US trader and want access to lower fees and a larger crypto selection, Binance could be the better choice for you.

However, it's worth noting that Binance's US version also offers low trading fees. Kraken offers low trading fees as well, but it may be a better choice for US traders in search of margin accounts or futures. Overall, Binance is the better option for advanced traders.",https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/kraken-vs-binance,2021-09-03,Business Insider,https://i.insider.com/61322ef49ef1e50018f9ab20?width=1200&format=jpeg,none

The zany ascent of NFT art collectors - Wired.co.uk,"Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile is moving places. It is not that he does not like his current Miami house. It is more that he needs a place where he can best enjoy his art collection. “The new home is going to have 15 or 16 screens all around, and projectors,” Rodriguez-Fraile, a 33-year-old Spaniard with a background in finance, says. That is because his collection consists not of sculptures, paintings or etchings, but of non-fungible tokens – or NFTs – unique cryptographic files that collectors regard as proofs of ownership of digital art pieces like videos, gifs, or computer-designed images.

Everyone can right-click and download the artwork an NFT is associated with; but the people who, like Rodriguez-Fraile, buy the tokens in online auctions for swingeing cryptocurrency sums, say they feel like the only real owners. Which is why Rodriguez-Fraile is looking forward to spending his days surrounded by screens constantly flaunting his purchases.

Rodriguez-Fraile’s work as a patron of the crypto arts, however, extends beyond his living room: he is currently working to open several digital art exhibition rooms around the world (the first, he says, will launch in Miami in the second half of 2021). And his efforts even transcend the physical realm, as he is one of the founders of the MOCA (Museum of Crypto Art), an NFT-backed art gallery hosted on a VR platform. “The best thing with these digital artworks is that we can travel with them, we can take them wherever we want, we can showcase them to people around the globe,” he says. “If you own a very nice masterpiece by Picasso, everybody knows you own it, but very few people will get to see it.”

The NFT art scene got white-hot incredibly fast: an NFT linked to a collage by American digital artist Beeple sold for $69,346,250 in cryptocurrency in a Christie’s auction in March 2021. Rodriguez-Fraile says he has twice spent $1 million on an NFT – on works by visual artists Pak and WhIsBe – and in March he made headlines after re-selling one of his pieces, a 38-second Beeple video, for over $6 million. To many, this is just the usual boom-and-bust cycle all cryptocurrency-adjacent fads go through – pointing out that nearly all collectors are wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, and that as of June 2021 NFT sales had crashed to less eye-catching levels. Others think that, whatever the fluctuations in price and buzz, NFT art is here to stay. Vincent Harrison, a Los Angeles-based art gallerist who has been working with NFT artists and platforms, says that collectors of digital art are no different from those who splurge on Tintorettos and Jeff Koons.

“It's the same collector mentality. The beauty of it with digital art is that people don't have to stop collecting because they never run out of space,” he says “This almost creates digital hoarders – which is fine, because I know plenty of collectors that have art they can't put on the wall: they have it in storage. But they still collect just because they love art.”

Rodriguez-Fraile, indeed, styles himself as a collector through and through: he carefully chooses his pieces guided by his aesthetic sense and the artist’s brand, and he cultivates friendly relationships with the creators whose work he enjoys. “This is never, never a monetary thought,” he says. He even says that, while he could hardly call himself an art collector before his journey through the NFT space – he was familiar with cryptocurrency, on the other hand – the experience has increased his love of “traditional art”: in May, he bought a David Bowie portrait by Elizabeth Peyton from Sotheby’s for $2 million. For others in this space, NFT-collecting is either a nuanced enterprise suffused with revolutionary undertones, or a pointless financial rat-race.",https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nft-collectors-pepe-beeple-decentraland,2021-09-04,Wired.co.uk,"https://media.wired.co.uk/photos/6130e1fcd34f8d473b63116c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0409_cryptoartv2.jpg",none

"Harrah's New Orleans Casino Requires Vaccination Card, On-Line Gambling Surges - Cryptonews","Disclaimer: The text below is an advertorial article that was not written by Cryptonews.com journalists.

Cryptocurrency is moving from virtual exchanges to the gaming sphere as on-line casinos start accepting the digital currency. The move could spell lower participation rates for brick-and-mortar establishments as gamblers move to internet games due to the pandemic.

Notably, New Orleans-based Harrah’s now requires that their guests be vaccinated to play. This is the first U.S. casino to enforce new restrictions for guests as cases continue to rise across the country.

Gambling Enters the Cryptosphere

Gambling companies are replicating the in-person experience of betting in a luxury casino through virtual platforms. One of the advantages of going digital is the ability to accept and process payments with cryptocurrency. This also gives guests greater incentive to play as they earn tokens that can easily be redeemed for popular coins such as Bitcoin and ETH.

Additionally, companies create their own rewards system in which players earn native tokens and participate in a dividend pool. The more each player wagers, the greater number of native tokens they receive. At the end of a certain time frame, players receive shares of the casino’s revenue according to the amount of native tokens they hold.

One example is BTC365, a licensed casino created specifically for crypto holders. The platform accepts Bitcoin, ETH and USDT, but also supports additional tokens such as Dogecoin. The Las Vegas experience is not lost, however, and players have access to everything available in a physical casino. Games such as roulette and poker, as well as the ability to play on several tables at once.

Where these companies shine is in innovating the gaming experience and making it specific to cryptocurrency. These ‘crypto games’ are designed with digital tokens in mind and are entirely original. These games, along with proprietary VIP and rewards systems incentivize players to play and rack up their points.

This list of benefits could convince players to leave physical casinos entirely. And if that’s not enough, many gambling houses are heeding the warnings from state governors and mayors to enforce stricter regulations. One example is Harrah’s in New Orleans which now requires guests be vaccinated after the announcement of state-wide mandates.

Harrah’s New Orleans Hotel and Casino Requires Covid Shots

The news that a vaccination card required by the casino would be the only way to enter came as the city announced tougher measures. New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell announced the new restrictions for all businesses including bars, restaurants, and gyms. Additionally, even larger open spaces where people gather such as fairgrounds and race tracks would fall under the mandate.

However, the mandate also allows flexibility under the new terms. Guests may also present negative Coronavirus test results to enter, as an alternative to getting the vaccine. The mandate covers any activity which is considered a “high transmission risk” for people over the age of 12.

Many businesses across the country are requiring their employees to be fully vaccinated after the FDA granted approval of Pfizers vaccine . The news may convince more people to get a vaccine which would grant them access to vaccination card required establishments.

Specifically, many casinos currently require their employees to either get the vaccine, or pay for their own Covid-19 tests. The average cost of these tests without insurance ranges from $100 to $200, which would make it much cheaper to get a vaccination card.

Las Vegas Following Suit

In Nevada, Governor Steve Sisolak commented on the possibility of establishing similar mandates as New Orleans. In a statement, Gov. Sisolak stated that while he didn’t necessarily want harsher restrictions, they could be a possibility if vaccination rates did not rise.

Las Vegas is also seeing some casinos and events taking matters into their own hands. The Life is Beautiful Music & Art Festival recently announced that they will require a vaccination card or else access could not be granted .

A post on the event’s Twitter page detailed their decision:

“Our most important duty as festival hosts is to keep you and your music-loving peers safe every festival weekend,” the post read. “We are putting extra measures in place for the 2021 festival to keep attendees safe from COVID-19”

Of course, with the popularity of Toto sites rising, there are also new fraudulent sites appearing. One way to play safely is through Mukcheck.com which creates a database of legitimate sites, as well as those considered fraudulent. Additionally, there are no covid restrictions, such as at Harrah’s as gameplay is completely online. This could be a new direction for gambler’s looking to escape the uncertainty of in-person gambling for the near future.

Curbing Restrictions with On-Line Gambling

For many who don’t want to take the vaccine or show negative Coronavirus test results, there is another option growing in popularity. Asian-based ‘ Toto ’ sites which host the largest on-line casinos offer a way to play from home, with all the luxuries guests expect.

Toto sites are secure and transparent, letting users create an account without the typical upfront costs of most online services. The sites offer anything from blackjack to poker, as well as slot machines and sports betting. One popular feature drawing many users is their high-stakes betting, called ‘Big Bang Betting’. Users can make one single high-sum wager and win big.

Toto also offers vetting and gambling history so that users can see each other’s reputation in other casinos. This is called a player’s ‘accident history’ and details any suspensions from other platforms. Thus, players can gamble with the peace of mind knowing that the site takes care to weed out scammers.

Advantages of Using Crypto for Gambling

There are also several benefits to using crypto in high-stakes transactions such as gambling. First of all, privacy is guaranteed which protects gamblers from fraud and unwanted attention. This is much more difficult to achieve in physical casinos. Additionally, players remain anonymous and rest assured that their data is fully protected.

The security behind crypto is also a widely known advantage to the cyber currency. Blockchain technology makes it very difficult to alter the database without a large part of the community knowing. It also makes it easy to track any changes, no matter how minimal, to their source. Encrypted transactions offer peace of mind in an industry that moves massive amounts of money daily.

Each transaction is also immediate, compared to delayed times processing winnings at regular casinos. Depositing and withdrawing from a virtual wallet is also quick and easy and mainly sidesteps the fees and verification processes charged by banks. Particularly, not dealing with any legal institutions is also a huge advantage.

Because cryptocurrency is largely decentralized, it is not subject to control by federal institutions. This means that taxes don’t apply and there are never any hidden costs apart from a standard fee which is sometimes used depending on the exchange. This means that players can withdraw their winnings hassle-free and with confidence that they’ll get exactly what they won.

When the dust from the pandemic settles, the gambling industry may see a great shift to digital games. And as more players opt for betting with crypto, confidence in the virtual currency can convince more to join. Still, digital currency remains one of the safest and most transparent options for transactions in an industry where peace of mind and reassurance means everything.",https://cryptonews.com/news/harrah-s-new-orleans-casino-requires-vaccination-card-on-lin-11693.htm,2021-09-04,Cryptonews,https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/613/3667742bdf.png,none
"Eastern Europe emerges as hotbed of crypto scams, costing investors millions - Sports Grind Entertainment","Eastern Europe has become a hotbed for cryptocurrency scams, according to a new analysis, with addresses in the region having a high rate of exposure to illicit transactions — second to only Africa.

A new report from Chainalysis, a blockchain forensics firm, mapped out the crypto crime landscape of Eastern Europe over the past year. Notably, a little-known billion dollar Ponzi scheme called Finiko accounted for more than half of funds in the region sent to scam addresses.

Indeed, crypto scams emanating from the region’s 290 million strong population are only dwarfed by the continent of Africa, which has a far larger estimated population — 1.3 billion people. According to the report, illegal crypto activity made up 0.5 percent of total crypto value, or more than $400 million sent and received from Eastern Europe.

With a market capitalization already at $2 trillion, half a percent of all the region’s crypto transactions is concerning to say the least, said Tyler Moffitt, a senior security analyst with Canada-based information security company, OpenText.

“Even if the market continues to rise every four or five years, illicit crypto flows should only keep growing, especially in places like Eastern Europe where cybercrime is abundant,” he added.

And the stakes are higher as scams proliferate. In the past year, the Russia-based Ponzi scheme and exit scam called Finiko dominated Eastern Europe’s illicit crypto flows. According to Chainanalysis’ report, more than 60% of all cryptocurrency sent from the region went to addresses attributed to “TheFiniko.com.”

An exit scam is a crypto-based trap whereby promoters (or founders) of an online business vanish without returning investor holdings. Well known perpetrators include the high-yield investment program and cryptocurrency, Bitconnect; and Canada-based bitcoin exchange, Quadriga, which lost $215 million of customer funds after its founder mysteriously died on his honeymoon.

Story continues

More recently, an alleged $3.6 billion worth of crypto was stolen from investors who used the South Africa-based crypto platform, Africrypt.

Other major crypto scams highlighted by Chainanalysis included J-Enco, which accounted for half the illicit crypto flows in Eastern Asia, and Mirror Trading International (MTI), another South Africa-based scam that received more than 60 percent of illicit crypto flows on the continent before its founder flew the coup.

‘Like Uber or Amazon Fresh’

This Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) computer screen image shows an online forum called “Dark Market” where it educates users where to buy skimming devices to penetrate bank accounts, how to distribute malware through spam, and buy stolen credit cards among other things. REUTERS/FBI/Handout (UNITED STATES CONFLICT SOCIETY BUSINESS SCI TECH)

In the past year, Eastern Europe received approximately $950 million in crypto from scam addresses, and the region also sends more cryptocurrency to ‘dark net’ markets than any other. This comes largely from Hydra market, a dark web market place that caters only to users in Russian-speaking countries throughout the region.

“Think of [Hydra market] as a competitor to Uber or Amazon Fresh but with the items for sale to include guns, drugs, false IDs, or anything else you covet on the black market, much of the same way that we might have groceries delivered to us,” said Carol Alexis Chen, a partner with the global law firm Winston & Strawn. She specializes in investigating and prosecuting large-scale white collar crime.

Eastern Europe’s massive illicit volume is unsurprising to Chen. She pointed out that by creating a widely expanding market for buyers and sellers, decentralized finance (DeFi) has offered criminals new opportunities to take advantage of the social and economic fallout stemming from COVID-19.

While the majority of money flooding into crypto over the past year appears legitimate, regulators have already begun to threaten crackdowns on questionable projects that offer higher than usual gains.

On Wednesday, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Gary Gensler pointed out that the more than $2 trillion asset class is “truly global” and “could continue to be a catalyst for change in the fields of finance and money.”

But he also reiterated the need to incorporate crypto into global public policy in order to protect investors, hinting at the DeFi and stable space.

“We’ve seen a lot of frauds, scams and abuse in the field,” Gensler told an audience at the European Union’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.”We’re focused on platforms, whether it’s trading or lending.”

Later that day, the SEC charged the founder of the crypto exchange platform, BitConnect, with fraudulently raising $2 billion dollars from retail investors.

‘That’s how they get you’

Source: Chainalysis

Launched in Russia in 2019 before going international the next year, Finiko once described itself as an “automated profit-generating system” on its now defunct website.

The company offered a number of haphazard investment programs such as loan repayments and discounts for buying cars or real estate. Its main deal, a supposed stablecoin called CFR, guaranteed investors a 20 to 30 percent monthly return, at a minimum payment of $1000 worth of Bitcoin or Tether.

Unlike most cryptocurrencies which are volatile, stablecoin prices don’t fluctuate. However, they can be staked for yield on DeFi platforms, such as Uniswap or SushiSwap.

“A stablecoin that guarantees to pay you 30 percent returns is not real,” said OpenText’s Moffitt. The analyst, who invests in cryptocurrency, admitted to falling prey to an Ethereum scam several years earlier.

“Anyone who buys into a scam desperately needs money. Some of Finiko’s initial investors might have even made a return, at the beginning of the Ponzi,” Moffitt said. “They might have also thought they were geniuses onto something no one else could see. That’s how they get you.”

And Chainalysis found that Finiko received more than $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency between December 2019 and August 2021 worldwide.

With the majority of volume coming from large and high exchanges, the scheme amounts to one of the largest crypto investment frauds perpetrated against investors, predominantly in Russian and Ukraine. This stands in stark contrast to the territory’s burgeoning ransomware industry, which often uses code that specifically restricts hurting victims within the region’s countries.

Three of Finiko’s founders were arrested by Russian authorities back in December 2020. In May, Finiko announced the launch of another cryptocurrency, FNK token. This cryptocurrency’s price and market cap varies widely based on cryptocurrency price tracking websites — but all show a massive price spike on June 17, when Finiko transferred all depositor settlements from into FNK tokens.

Withdrawal issues began in July shortly after the FNK price collapsed according to the blog, BehindMLM which tracks Ponzi schemes and multi-level marketing scams.

In July, Finiko’s main founder and Instagram Influencer, Kirill Doronin, withdrew all the company’s remaining funds from Turkey, then returned to Russia — leaving his investors on the hook for millions.

Authorities detained Doronin and put him on trial in his hometown in the Russian city of Kazan. In a Yotube video posted 5 months earlier titled, Money Now, Money Tomorrow, Money Later, Doronin explained to his audience, “no one can give us any guarantees in this world. Uncertainty is the norm. We’re open to it.”

"In a crumbling economy, Venezuela’s cheap electricity is a blessing for its Bitcoin miners - Euronews","In the highly competitive world of crypto mining, economically-battered Venezuela has one advantage - extremely cheap electricity.

With energy prices as low as 0.06 cents per kilowatt/hour, mining cryptocurrencies is proving to be extremely lucrative for one Caracas-based entrepreneur, in a country riddled by economic uncertainty and some of the highest rates of hyperinflation in the world.

Mining firm Doctor Miner has a bank of 80 shoebox-sized computers that each cost around €340 and mine Bitcoin 24 hours a day, generating €8,500 worth of the token a month.

Company president Theodoro Toukoumidis said the firm began mining Ethereum from staff members' homes in 2016, before setting up the grid of computers that now focus on Bitcoin.

“In Venezuela, any old-gen, mid-gen or next-gen mining machine is profitable,” he told AFP.

""I sold my car to buy a computer and I literally had to walk everywhere to buy my first machine. And my partner exchanged the motorcycle he had for a computer and the two of us stayed on foot, betting absolutely everything on this technology,"" he added.

Blackouts and slow internet

While Venezuela suffers from regular power blackouts and slow internet speeds, they are not enough to disrupt a growing cryptomining industry.

Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, has been dogged by hyperinflation over several years.

The country's central bank has declared it will cut six zeros from the currency from October 1, to try and save it from sliding further against the US dollar.

Venezuela will cut six zeros from the Bolivar from October 1 to save the currency from further inflation

The bank has already cut eight zeros from the bolivar since 2008.

Having cryptocurrencies ""is a way out of hyperinflation in Venezuela for many people,"" said Venezuelan economist Aaron Olmos.

""In Venezuela the kilowatt/hour is very cheap, practically 0.06 cents. And that makes validating a blockchain or mining a cryptocurrency much more profitable for any Venezuelan than in any other country,"" he said.

In 2017, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro launched a cryptocurrency called the 'Petro' which he said would be used to get around what his government called the US's ""financial blockade"" of the country.

Despite Maduro pushing for its wider use, it has failed to win consumer or investor confidence.",https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/09/04/in-a-crumbling-economy-venezuela-s-cheap-electricity-is-a-blessing-for-its-bitcoin-miners,2021-09-04,Euronews,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/06/02/19/24/1000x563_cmsv2_3e7601a1-4b69-52ed-804f-305c19be9e7a-6021924.jpg,none
Minister: Power theft due to cryptocurrency activities significant contributor to SEB revenue loss - The Borneo Post,"MIRI (Sept 4): Cryptocurrency has contributed significantly to Sarawak Energy Berhad’s (SEB) revenue losses due to power theft in the state in recent years, said Utilities Minister Dato Sri Dr Stephen Rundi Utom.

He said that from 2018 until Aug 2021, there had been 125 cases of power theft statewide, out of which 74 were in Miri, Kuching (41), Sibu (8) and Bintulu (2).

This resulted in a loss of revenue of RM21.4 million, said Dr Stephen.

“To date, 13 power theft cases prosecuted in court have plead guilty while another six cases are still ongoing. The total fines paid for those cases amounted to RM348,000,” he said in a statement yesterday.

He added that since 2010, power theft had resulted in a cumulative revenue loss of about RM1.4 billion to SEB, of which the revenue losses in 2010 was about RM220 million and decreasing to RM73 million in 2020.

“Various measures have been taken by SEB to curb power theft, including active and continuous inspections by working closely with the Utilities Ministry, State Attorney-General’s Chambers, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) as well as the police by detecting using digital techhnology, prosecution of cases in court and public awareness and information sharing.

“SEB also has their technical staff members who are adequately trained and equipped to detect power theft,” Dr Stephen said.

Members of the public are encouraged to report any power theft, as it is a dangerous act which endangers lives and damages customers’ properties including electrical appliances which may lead to fire.

"XTZ Price Prediction 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 2025 Review Trading Chart Analysis - Upto Brain","Economists from across the world are now concluding that existing financial systems are badly broken and unstable. The global economy needs a better currency to rely on. Scientists came up with a blockchain solution to tackle problems related to sustainability and scalability.

Though a few issues remained unresolved, Once again, the hybrid consensus system of blockchain and its numerous coins has been discussed at length. Before we consider the price predictions for Tezos, let’s examine some of the distinctive elements of the Tezos protocol.

However, few networks have addressed the interoperability problems, which are a barrier to efficient trade. Significant issues for scientifically designed systems include high transaction costs and a lack of transparency; many cryptocurrencies have not addressed these concerns. The number of people with a basic understanding of cryptocurrencies, such as Tezos, has grown in recent years.

Tezos (XTZ): The Wonders of Work

Those who are genuinely devoted to Tezos will always want to utilise XTZ instead of cash. A large number of Tezos enthusiasts are sure that digital money is the future. Institutional and company adoption of XTZ is based on the following fundamentals:

By keeping transaction costs low, investors may use credit cards to trade more quickly.

Pay a low/minimal transaction cost and no exorbitant hidden fees from either banks or brokers.

Unlike traditional banks, which rely on funds deposited by customers, cryptocurrency is self-sustaining.

No third-party permission is needed.

Substitute for a tangible product

A trusted method of storing and keeping your cargo safe while avoiding the hassle of hauling around clunky bags

People and investors are sharing power, which takes the middleman out of the equation.

Discretion is essential in preserving confidentiality for investors and transactions since KYC details are not disclosed, and payments are not connected to conventional verification procedures.

The acceptance of any kind of payments

Tezos: A Bright Future

The Tezos price forecast has gone from very bearish to highly bullish in only one year. XTZ has made a remarkable trip throughout history. All that’s been said and done, XTZ’s stock price trend has been very aggressive. Therefore the future seems extremely promising. The currency may see explosive growth, particularly among unions. If new partnerships are formed, XTZ will come to the forefront, and therefore become the epicentre of investment and a socially respected cryptocurrency. While XTZ does this, more transactions will occur in seconds, making it hard for its cryptocurrency competitors to keep up.

Tezos Price

The Tezos price rose steadily, but this asset’s position as the top cryptocurrency didn’t come as a result of that alone. Instead, savvy investors know to wait and watch Tezos, performing and doing marvels on the exchange. Even though Tezos’ performance in the markets has not soared, one obvious thing is that Tezos is here to stay, develop, and flourish.

XTZ Price Prediction 2021

The promise of simple spending, in addition to ease of usage, are advantages that every Tezos (XTZ) coin owner appreciates. Tezos quickly developed a stable network with a pleasing user experience. The XTZ price may reach new all-time highs around $5 as a result of these characteristics. The Tezos price may witness a massive leap if the crypto market’s functional currency momentum continues until 2021.

Tezos Price Prediction 2022

When everything lines up in favor of Tezos, its price will spike, ascending as previously discussed. Despite certain slow tendencies, investors may look forward to a year of market gains. Thanks to its solid and intelligent contracts, the Tezos price will likely reach $6.2 by the end of 2022.

XTZ Price Prediction 2023

The masterminds plan out the Tezos cryptocurrency’s more advanced features. As a result, the token could be expected to increase in value to reach a $7-$7.5 price point over the next three years. However, investors should be aware of any unanticipated circumstances. No one could imagine the disease outbreak!

Tezos Price Prediction 2024

Crypto markets aren’t subject to boomerang effects, but Tezos is ready to prove itself a significant draw among its investors. The price of Tezos may hit $8.5 if investors continue to be confident in the currency, which would mean the path ahead is paved with flowers.

XTZ Price Prediction 2025

XTZ’s price will rise to the shock of many, owing to its sustained success over time. With such hopes this year, bitcoin will see a huge boom. This new all-time high price of $10 that Tezos is now sitting at is likely to climb much higher in the future.

Conclusion

A few cryptocurrency experts worry the market may experience a few peaks and valleys. But these worries are probably unwarranted. At last, the Tezos currency will stabilise, and its investors will reap the benefits. Everything will hinge on the team’s activities, possible technical advances, or the establishment of a high-level collaboration.

In keeping with the previously agreed-upon conditions, Tezos must undergo a significant transformation in the way it cultivates partnerships and alliances to boost its visibility and inject more money into the project, making it relevant to all of its users and investors.",https://www.uptobrain.com/business/xtz-price-prediction/,2021-09-04,Upto Brain,https://www.uptobrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Fevican.png,none

BTC Forecast: UK students invest more in Bitcoin nowdays - City Telegraph,"In 2021, UK students are investing in cryptocurrencies to cover their living costs. According to a survey conducted by financial education resource Save The Student, the proportion of students investing in crypto tripled during the year.

Reasons to invest in cryptocurrencies

As part of the study, 2,038 UK university students were interviewed between May and August 2021. Respondents cited mental health issues and the Covid-19 pandemic as the most likely reasons to invest in cryptocurrencies. However, 41% of those surveyed cited lack of money as a number one problem. Three-quarters of those surveyed said they had considered dropping out of school because they did not have enough money to pay for it.

“The usual sources of funding for students are becoming difficult to access due to the volatility of the job market and because some parents lost their income during the pandemic,” said Jake Butler of Save the Student.

However, regulators are warning young people about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. The UK’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) said young people invest in products for which no one is responsible. Last November the FSA banned retail investors from buying cryptocurrency derivatives.

How Much Money Do Students Need?



On average, young people face a monthly living expense of 810 pounds sterling ($ 1,120). Research has shown that the typical student is missing £ 340 per month. Possible income does not cover the average monthly cost of travel, food and accommodation.

The most likely ways to fill this gap are financial support from parents, part-time work, and savings.

Some students said they found other ways to make money, from bank overdrafts and selling real estate to gambling and participating in drug trials. Crypto investing has remained a niche with 6% of students participating. However, this figure has tripled over the past year.

It is worth noting that the attitude of the people of the United Kingdom towards cryptocurrencies has changed dramatically. They no longer see digital assets as speculation and see them as a serious investment option. While last year 38% of people compared the cryptocurrency market to gambling, that number has now dropped to 9%.

Remember that this June the company Opinium conducted a survey for the direct investment platform Interactive Investor. 1,000 British respondents aged 18 to 29 took part in this survey. 45% of young people have chosen cryptocurrencies as their first investment. Bitcoin is the undisputed leader of digital assets, a fifth of those surveyed had already invested in it.",https://citytelegraph.com/crypto/5447/btc-forecast-uk-students-invest-more-in-bitcoin-nowdays/,2021-09-04,City Telegraph,https://i2.wp.com/citytelegraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BTC-Forecast-UK-students-invest-more-in-Bitcoin-nowdays.jpg?fit=560%2C315&ssl=1,none
Crypto needs regulation – fintech adviser - The Manila Times,"The chairman of the US financial regulator is right about cryptocurrency trading platforms: they should be regulated, affirms the chief executive of one of the world's largest independent financial advisory asset managements and fintech organizations.

The comments from Nigel Green, chief executive and founder of deVere Group, follow a Financial Times (FT) interview published on Wednesday with Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Wall Street's top watchdog.

In the interview, Green said that while he was ""technology neutral,"" crypto assets were no different than any others when it came to public policy requirements, including investor protection, guarding against illicit activity and maintaining financial stability.

""It must be championed that the man at the top is taking a future-focused and pragmatic approach to cryptocurrencies - which have a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion and which are becoming an increasingly dominant part of the mainstream global financial system,"" Green said. ""Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, XRP, among others, are not going anywhere. Crypto is very much here to stay as financial assets and as mediums of exchange.""

""Therefore, they must be brought into the regulatory tent and be held to the same rigorous standards as the rest of the financial system. The best way to do this is through the exchanges,"" Green said. ""Nearly all foreign exchange transactions go through banks or currency houses, and this is what needs to happen with cryptocurrencies. When flows run through regulated exchanges, it will be much easier to tackle potential wrongdoing, such as money laundering, and make sure tax is paid.""

Gensler's interview with the FT follows his fresh demands last month that Congress grant the SEC more power to oversee the growing crypto market.

""The watchdog needs more powers over the market as there's a clear direction of travel: both institutional and retail investors are taking Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more and more seriously. They are increasing their exposure to them at a faster rate than ever before,"" said the deVere chief executive at the time ""The SEC seems aware that digital assets are the inevitable future of money, therefore they require more oversight.""

Green is both a long-term and high-profile advocate of cryptocurrencies, but also of regulation of the sector. He has publicly supported global financial regulators, central banks, lawmakers and governments who have moved to support introducing it.

""There's sustained interest in and demand for cryptocurrencies so what's needed is a strong regulatory framework to be established and approved at an international level."" Green said. ""This will help protect investors, make the sector itself more robust, tackle cryptocurrency criminality, and reduce the potential possibility of disrupting global financial stability, as well as offering a potential long-term economic boost to those countries which introduce it. Cryptocurrency regulation is required and, I believe, on its way.",https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/09/05/business/sunday-business-it/crypto-needs-regulation-fintech-adviser/1813540,2021-09-04,The Manila Times,https://www.manilatimes.net/theme_manilatimes/images/TMTFB_1920x1008.jpg,none
Ethereum records negative daily issuance for first time after EIP-1559 - The Block Crypto,"The daily issuance of the world's second largest cryptocurrency has gone negative for the first time since the Ethereum network's EIP-1559 upgrade.

The Block's Data Dashboard shows that the daily net emission of ether (ETH) on September 3 was -333, which became negative about 30 days after the EIP-1559 upgrade was activated on August 5.

The upgrade changes Ethereum's monetary policy by burning part of the transaction fees in every new block that previously belonged to Ethereum miners in an effort to alleviate the fees for network users.

Since the code activation, about 193,000 ETH have been burnt as of press time, worth more than $700 million at ETH's current price.

The Block's Dashboard further shows the amount of ETH burnt on September 3 was 13,840, surpassing the 13.507 ETH that were newly minted as block subsidies over the same period.

Since August 5, the daily issuance of ETH has been on a deflationary trend. While Ethereum's mining revenue managed to hold up in August by dollar terms, it was mainly due to ETH's price rally and the surge of on-chain activities relating to the NFT markets.

In fact, the transaction fees that Ethereum miners collected in August went down from over 90,000 ETH in July to just above 66,159 ETH while more than 170,000 ETH were burnt last month.

About 15% of the burnt ETH for August were transaction fees associated with on-chain activities on the NFT marketplace Opensea, public data shows.",https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/116659/ethereum-negative-daily-emission-eip-1559,2021-09-04,The Block Crypto,https://www.tbstat.com/wp/uploads/2021/08/Webp.net-resizeimage4.jpg,none
